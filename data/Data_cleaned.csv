1,NTA,AITA for opening the door to the house while cat sitting,"A friend asked me to cat-sit when they went on vacation. Just feed them and scoop the litter every day. The cats were in the garage (as it was only a week and they would pee everywhere) and so were all their cat supplies. After I finished scooping the litter, I went inside to wash my hands. The house starts beeping and the alarm goes off. A policeman arrives and we get the situation sorted and everything is all good. 

However, once I told them, they got super mad because it was a $100~ fine or something. They want me to pay it. 

They had not mentioned the house alarm once, and they have admitted that. However, they believe that I should ""own up to my mistake"" and pay them back. 

EDIT: thanks guys, I'll stand my ground

2,NTA,AITA for not wanting to pay for this camera?,"I was at a party last week, and it was around ~2am. By that point, I'm near the edge of too-drunk and I wandered into the living room of this house. This girl, who I'd just met that night, hands me a camera and motions for me to take a photo of her and her friends. I managed to drop it seconds after I move it up to take the photo. We both inspect the camera, and it turns out that the flash wasn't working. I apologize profusely. The next day she adds me on Facebook and asks me to pay for the repairs since it turns out this was a $400 camera. The guy at the shop told her it'd cost $175. I tell her I'm pretty broke, but I can spare at least $100. She tells me that it's my fault it's broken, and that I need to pay for* the entire thing.

I'm going to call around to see if I can't find a place that will do it for cheaper, but I'll probably just end up putting it on my credit card. 

I feel that you shouldn't be giving expensive shit to drunk people, and that she should be taking at least some of the responsibility here. Am I an asshole for thinking that?

Okay, thanks everyone. I'll probably still pay for the repairs myself, but It's good to know that I'm not completely in the wrong here.",2015-02-10 05:53:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2ve2ox/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_for_this_camera/,13,18,0.9,0
3,ESH,AITA in this situation?,"So this happened recently.

A friend/acquaintance/friend-of-a-friend/someone I know/not sure of the relationship and I got in fight. During this, we both said some things that we shouldn't have, and I for one regret it. I'm definitely the asshole in that right.

However, since then I've tried everything I can to make it right, I've apologised 30+ times in the last fortnight, saying I'm sorry, I was wrong, I'm an asshole, what can I do to make it up to you?, but they just continue to ignore me. I wish to make this right, especially for the sake of a joint good friend but they just refuse to talk. Then yesterday she messaged me for help with her studies, I gave it to her but after that she went back to ignoring me.

I feel like the asshole, but I also I feel that I shouldn't let her make me feel guilty because I tried to fix things and she's being stubborn.

I'm autistic and clinical depressed, I'm not trying to make excuses, but sometimes I say things without thinking of the consequences.

What pisses me off about this is that I cannot participate because I don't have unhealthy eating habits.

5,NTA,AITA for telling the person on the phone that my dad was asleep?,"When this happened my dad had been in his room, lying in bed for over an hour. When the phone rang my mom couldn't answer it my brother was whining, general chaos around the house. My dad yelled from his room ""someone get the phone"" which I thought was weird since he always has the phone with him. Anyway I answered it and it was my uncle asking for my dad. I said I thought he was asleep and offered to check to which he replied that it was ok and he would call later.

Detail: the phone is a landline phone so I couldn't leave my room while talking.

So, when I got out of the room my dad (still in his room with the lights off) asked me who was on the phone and when I told him he got really angry because apparently he was awake and I should have known that since he talked to me (refering to the yelling for someone to get the phone which he would have also done if he had been awakened by the phone).

6,NTA,AITA for being mad at my friend for not paying me back?,"I have a friend who will often buy me food. Not because I ask, just as a favor if we are somewhere together and hungry and I don't have money. She often has more money than me and has always made it a point to say that her paying is friendly favor and I don't owe her. Last week, we were going to go to the movies, and we were each planning to pay for our tickets. When we got there, she had forgotten her wallet, and told me if I paid for her ticket, she would pay me back the next day. A few days later I asked if she could give me the 10 dollars because I needed it for bus fare, and she told me she realized afterwards she shouldn't have to pay me because she had bought me things in the past adding up to much more than $10.

Am I an asshole for being angry at her? I understand her point that she had paid for me before, but I was never told that she expected me to pay her back. $10 is not a lot of money, but I still feel like she doesn't have the right to say she won't pay me back after I paid for her under the pretenses she would.",2015-05-19 19:16:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/36j12o/aita_for_being_mad_at_my_friend_for_not_paying_me/,11,11,0.93,0

I told her, politely, to please leave me alone, that i wasn't having a good day, but she laughed in my face and continued to annoy me further. And then i exploded. I got in her face and used the full extent of my colorful language at her until i finally just threw my hands up and walked away, leaving her there, shocked. When i came back to my senses later, i felt incredibly guilty. I texted her an apology and explanation (bad day, too much stress and whatnot) but she still hasn't responded.

9,NTA,AITA for forgetting to say thank you when someone held the door open for me.,"So a while ago I was in my school show, and it had just ended. I walked home with my friend who does not go to my school, with whom I rarely get the chance to speak, and we hit up a really intense conversation. As we left the building, a woman held the door open for us, but deep in conversation, we didn't really take notice. When we get out of the building the woman stops out conversation, smiles at us and says to us ""You know when someone holds the door open for you, you say thank you,"" as if we're in first grade. We apologized and said thank you, and that was the end of the exchange. I understand I should've said thank you in that situation, but was her rudeness necessary in this case?

10,YTA,AITA for not wanting a relationship with my father,"So I am 17 years old and 2 months away from moving to college and basically starting my own life. Ever since I was little, I have never gotten along with my dad. We don't have the same interests, the only time we speak is if something needs to be done or if a question needs to be answered, and just never really spent time together as I was growing up unless we were forced to (family vacation, ect). We do not casually chat or have deep conversations, the only time I can think of an instance like this was when I was checked into rehab for suicidal threats where we both broke down and promised to try and fix our relationship but that didn't hold up even a week after I got out. We would always argue and disagree until it got to the point that we just started ignoring each other even when we were in the same room. I can count on my hand the amount of texts I have ever sent my dad. Since I recently graduated and my younger brother just turned 16, my dad said that he would get me a new car and pass down mine to my brother. When we were having lunch (silently) after looking at some used cars, we got into an argument that lead to screaming. He got frustrated that I would be so rude as to raise my voice when he does all these nice things for me like pay for my college and buy me a car. I am thankful for these things but afterwords he asked me if I even wanted to have a relationship with him. I honestly didn't know what to say because I knew that I do not want to have a functioning relationship with him like I do with my mother, but he said that it makes him sad because he wants to have a relationship with me more than anything. When I got home I got into my room and burst into tears because of how bad I felt for not wanting a relationship but deep down I know that the emotional scars and 17 years of disconnect has really fucked me up to a certain extent but he doesn't know as I rarely spend time with him.

12,NTA,AITA Not attending my cousin's wedding?,"A little bit of backstory here. 

I come from a very large, blended family. I have more cousins than I can count, and as a result unfortunately many of us generally close in age have formed ""cliques"" in a way. It's not that I dislike my family, just that I have a whole lot of it and there are only so many hours in the week. 

So around July last year my cousin tells me at a gathering she's getting married, and that she isn't sure if she will be able to invite everyone, because like I said before, huge family. I tell her just let me know and congratulations. 

Fast forward to a couple months ago and I get my invitation. I notified her that I wouldn't be attending. Now I won't be going because of the following:

1. I work a lot. Like, as in 6 days a week, usually 55-60 hours at the least. I work the day of her wedding and it's a long hike from work. 
2. I wasn't given a guest +1 for the event, despite the fact that my girlfriend and I have been seeing each other as long as she's been seeing this guy. (Not that she moved fast or anything.)
3. My previously mentioned girlfriend works in the airline industry and I haven't seen her in about 10 days. She'll be flying back in on the evening of the wedding (which again she wasn't invited to.)
4. Her and I have never been particularly close. We're friends on Facebook and all but I don't even have her number. She's from one of the other ""cliques,"" I suppose. When she notified me I wouldn't be receiving a guest for the reception, she did so via Facebook message. 
5. Her mom, who is my aunt, have a lot of bad blood. Long story I won't get into here. 

So as soon as my mom and dad find out about the whole ordeal of me not going I'm an asshole and this is the reason us cousins aren't close, and blah blah blah. 

I'm not going either way, I just wanted this subs input. ",2015-06-13 03:40:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/39o2h3/aita_not_attending_my_cousins_wedding/,10,12,0.93,0

14,YTA,AITA for not wanting to cover a coworkers shift,"I'm pretty confident I'm not but what's got me here is the reaction of other people I work with.

Our story begins during dinner. I get a text from a coworker asking if I can cover their shift tomorrow because they have a job interview. Normally this wouldn't be a problem but I had plans and it's my only day off for the week. I text her back saying I'd really rather not do it because I have plans and ask her to try someone else. 
After a brief time she says no one else can do it. I check the roster and discover she has Friday off so I reply to her saying ""I'll have to cancel my plans to do this and I'm not very happy about you just assuming I'd do this for you when you're free the very next day."" 


Anytime I've had an interview or whatever else I've always made sure to schedule it for a day off because my job is my responsibility to take care of, right? I've never had an interviewer have a problem with this.

So she texts me back acting like I'm the asshole in this situation. I was pretty confused by this so I ran it past a couple of my other coworkers and they both pretty much said ""Why didn't you just do it?""

I mean like... How am I the dick here?

And just as a little bit of icing on the cake. I'm driving my mother to the airport on friday morning before work. It's gonna take about 3 and a half hours there and back and I'm still showing up for my 9am start.

15,NTA,AITA for ending a friendship?,"Ok, so last year I ended a friendship with a longtime friend, and she seems to be wanting to move past it, but I am feeling like I don't want to, am I being an asshole?


The backstory is that we were in a friend group in high school that hung out together all the time, and at the base of that group were four girls, including me.  I was extremely close with the one (we'll call her Kay), and good friends with the other two (we'll call them Ali and Jess).  Ali is the friend I'm talking about now.  After we graduated we all went off to colleges in different states and slowly grew apart.  Jess dropped off the face of the earth completely, and I vaguely kept in email contact with Kay and Ali.  Ali dropped out and moved back home, but she worked really hard and has an awesome job, so she's been doing well.  I never thought I'd move back even remotely close to where I grew up, but I ended up going to graduate school about 2 hours away from where I grew up, and I reconnected with Ali.  We grew up in a small town, so she always wanted to come visit me to come to the big city, and I would visit her occasionally, but not nearly as often as she would come to see me.  Typically her visits involved her going to some event, like a concert or sporting event and she would crash at my place.


So the start of the fall out started a few years ago when I was diagnosed with cancer.  I was really sick and in the hospital and I talked to her about visiting, she said she was slammed at work and couldn't make it, but she sent a card and a gift.  No big deal, I totally understood.  Fast forward about six months, she came into town to visit, I was on the mend.  We go out to lunch and I was telling her how hard everything had been, she says now that I've opened up she should as well.  That she had been lying about being single for all these years, and that she'd actually had a boyfriend for about two years.  She said the reason she hadn't told me was because it was scandalous, and I was thinking maybe he was married or something.  Then she tells me its because he's black.  I found this really offensive, because I could care less about that, and if she knew me at all she would know that.  I brought up that Jess is black and dated white guys and none of us thought anything of that, so why would this be any different.  She was like oh well I just didn't know if you were racist or not.  So I was already mad, but then she tells me that she's been coming to town about every week with him to go to events and stuff, but never told me because she didn't want me to know about him.  So she didn't come visit me when I was in the hospital with cancer because she didn't want me to know about her secret black boyfriend.


The second strike is our beach trip a few months later.  We had already planned and paid for it when I found this out, so I decided to suck it up and try to make it as fun as possible.  We go out one night, I drove and was DD, she proceeds to get trashed, and cause a scene at the bar we were at.  She invited two guys back to our place even though we both have boyfriends, and I had to tell them they were not actually invited and to leave us alone, and she starts yelling at me about how I'm such a worrier and that nothing was going to happen and I'm no fun, etc etc.  I drove us back to our condo and I was pissed.  I mostly read on the beach the next day, and I didn't drive us to go back out, and then I went straight home.  


Strike three for me was kinda two things together, but they were similar.  The first was her coming to visit to go to something during the day and wanted me to go with her, I told her I had to work and couldn't.  I worked all day and then went out that night, and she thought this was rude because I said I couldn't hang out.  Then I was supposed to see her before Thanksgiving and ended up having to work, I warned her a week in advance that I wouldn't be able to make it, and she told me to text her the day of to confirm.  I said ok, but then I forgot, because I was focused on work, and at 4pm she texted me and said ""I guess you're not coming"" I told her that I had already let her know and was going to text her when I got home.  I apologized and said that maybe I didn't come across clear, but that I thought I had let her know.  She said that our friendship doesn't seem like a priority to me and that I'm a shitty friend.  So I told her if that's how she feels then great, but I don't care because I'm done being friends with someone who treats me the way that she does.  I haven't talked to her again since.


Recently, she has been emailing saying she misses me and wants to move past everything and be friends again.  I don't have any interest in trying to work through that with her, and I'd rather her not be in my life.  Am I being the asshole?  Should I try to work things out?  Was I wrong?  Thanks!





TL;DR; My longtime friend didn't visit me when I had cancer because she didn't want me to know about her secret black boyfriend because she didn't know if I was racist (I'm not), she was a drunken rude mess on our beach trip, and told me I'm a shitty friend for having to cancel on her because of work, am I the asshole for ending our friendship and not wanting to mend it?",2015-06-26 19:10:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3b85d3/aita_for_ending_a_friendship/,17,15,0.83,0

17,YTA,Am I the asshole for asking my parents to pay me back when I buy them things?,"So, I'm 19 and still live with my parents. I have a part time job averaging about 25 hours a week at minimum wage. My parents will ask me occassionally(as im sure all parents do) to pick up milk or some groceries from the store. I don't mind the chore, I like getting out and driving and walking around. However, what I do mind, is when I give them the receipt from my trip, which contains all THEY wanted(if I get anything for me, I do it on a seperate transaction as to not add confusion to the bill). Then, when I ask to be paid for it, my mother gets up in arms over asking for my money back. She uses arguments like, ""Oh well, I buy you things when im at the store and I don't ask you to pay me"" or ""When I was your age, Id buy my moms stuff because I loved my mommy so much."", which to me doesn't make sense seeming how I pick up what I need or ask if they want me to pay them for any groceries I put on the list. The thing is, I wouldn't mind if these were just snide comments, but these turn into days long arguments over something like $11. Another factor that may play in is after my grandfather died, he left me a substantial amount of money to help pay for college, which my mother believes she was cheated out of. I already have lent her about $500 with her not paying that back yet, arguing that it shouldve been hers anyway. I feel I should mention my mom is on disability and my dad works full time. I guess, I want my money back, because I know if I don't ask in the moment, my mothers going to think that everytime she sends me to the store that Ill just cover it and end up making my lists so much longer and more expensive since I ""have the money to afford it anyway."" What do you think here?

18,NTA,Coworker threatened to kill me off work property - AITA?,"Hey guys, my first post, so here goes nothing:

This happened this morning, just a few minutes ago.

I was on my way to work, stopped at the convenience store on the other side of the parking lot from work, and my girlfriend (who also works with me) came with.  On our way over a coworker, we'll call her Bethany, got my girlfriend's attention and asked about trivial stuff while I paced ahead of them, not wanting to get involved.  When my GF told me to slow down because I was walking too fast, I told her (loud enough that she could hear me, about 20 feet away) that she was talking to Bethany and I ""didn't want to have anything to do with that.""  My girlfriend knows the past stuff that has gone on between Bethany and I, and knows that I do not like this person.

Anyway, I went into the convenience store and Bethany followed us in.  I think she came up to me first, came behind me while I was at the counter, and said, ""That was highly inappropriate,""  I said back, ""Well I'm not going to be rude to you at work, but outside of work...""  I believe it was then that she came up to my girlfriend and said that, ""You better tell your girl that if I ever hear my name pass her lips again, I'm going to fucking kill her.""

Now, my GF and I sat down for a little while, eating our breakfast sandwiches that we bought, and she told me that, ""Sometimes the things I say are so embarassing.""  This is when she told me that Bethany had threatened my life.

Let me give you a little back story, so you know the context.

I've been working here for about a year, and the first cubicle I was assigned to I sat immediately behind Bethany.  I knew who she was because I had seen her on the bus before (gotta love mass transit, right?) and I tried to become friends with her, since that's always my reaction to meeting new people.  She would have good days and bad days, and to be honest, my humor tends towards dry sarcasm.  Everyone else that I interract with at work gets the same, but only she seems to take it personally.  The incident that prompted her first threat against me was very mild, I thought.

We have a rule at work that cell phones are not to be out and used.  If a supervisor sees you with a cell phone then they will pass that along to your supervisor and then they will possibly take disciplinary action against you.  On this particular day, I had gotten up to use the bathroom and on my way back she startled hard, because she was on her phone and scared that it might be a Sup and not a coworker who had seen her breaking the rules. I appologized for startling her, and sat down and went back to work.  The next time it happened again.  This time, as I passed her and she freaked out, I said that maybe if she didn't have her cell phone out, she wouldn't be so startled by people walking past her.  When I sat down she said, very quietly, that she would beat me up after work.

She didn't.  But ever since that day I have actively tried to avoid being in the same place at the same time.  Obviously sometimes, like this morning, it is unavoidable.

I brought this to the attention of my union, but the entire thing still makes me think that I may have somehow overreacted when I said, within earshot of Bethany, that I didn't want to have anything to do with her.  Should I have been more meek about this?

TL;DR: Coworker that has a history of threatening me took it to the max this morning when she told my girlfriend (who was with me) that she would ""fucking kill me"".

19,NTA,AITA for telling some stranger to stop beating the shit out his kid in the grocery store?,"This was the scenario:

I'm shopping, rolling my cart down the aisle, when suddenly a little boy  (I'm guessing around 3 or 4 years old) jumps in front of my cart and playfully yells:  ""Get outta my way!!""  I laughed.

Suddenly, his Dad  (I guess) comes storming around the corner and beats the living hell out of this kid.  It was more than just a Dad-like spanking like I used to get when I was his age...but it was a spanking - not like the guy punched him or anything.  ""You do NOT talk to your elders that way!!""

I was shocked for a moment but then said, ""Dude!  Is that really necessary?!""  He says, ""Mind yer own goddamn business.""  His Mom then gives the kid a screaming at.  Everyone else was just walking by this situation not paying any mind.  I went about my shopping.  But that really pissed me off.

Should I have just turned the other way?  I guess I have no right to tell him how to parent.  But fuck.  Am I the asshole?

EDIT:  More information regarding said spanking have been requested.  As I mentioned previously, this is not what I would call a ""swat"".  The Dad was a huge guy - judging from his tats, appeared to be a former  (or current)  Marine.  By ""huge"", I mean ""hits the gym daily"" huge...not overweight.  The child was...meh...about the average size for a 4 year old, I would say.  The spanking itself was a ""rear back and SPANK...HARD.""  I'm not the biggest guy  (I weigh about a buck 40, would be considered thin) - but let's just say that if this guy hit ME with that much force, it would have hurt ME.  I recall my Dad spanking me as a child and I certainly had a sore bottom afterward but I don't see this kid sitting down tonight.  People, it was bad.

20,YTA,AITA for not helping out my dad and brother when i was busy?,"So, today I am going camping. I am getting picked up in two hours, and in that time, i have to shower/get dressed/shit/shave etc, pack, and get my gear together. My family knows this. I came home from staying at my friends house the night before at noon. I made something to eat and took a nap at 1, and just woke up at 3. My dad calls me and says my brother forgot his jersey or something, and he needs me to bring it to the field. I told him i don't really have time, because I'm getting ready for camping, and I am getting picked up and don't want to cause a delay. He gets quite mad and says something like, ""you know, i'll remember this."" Now i'm just confused. Should i just find the damn jersey and bring it up there? Am i the asshole for not having time?


Update: Ended up feeling like a dick, so i went and found the jersey, and drove it up to the field. Dad thanked me, i went home and got ready. All is well now.",2015-07-10 20:15:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3cu5ci/aita_for_not_helping_out_my_dad_and_brother_when/,6,2,0.57,0
21,YTA,AITA for being candid about something related to my former work where my former boss could see?,"Sorry, this is kind of serious and possibly boring...but I genuinely want to know if I made an asshole move.   Husband says yes I should have known better.   

I used to work at a nonprofit that does work in India, and quit recently because they needed more time than I could give.  I recently read ""Beyond the Beautiful Forevers,"" which is about life an a slum in Mumbai and a lot about the corruption in India.  There is a part about the people in the slums using corrupt methods to get money from Western charities and use it for different purposes.  According to this book, and in fact some of our experience doing business in India, bribes and corruption aren't just part of the fabric of the culture and economy there - they ARE the culture and economy, and it made me really question whether charity work can be done *at all* in the way we try to do it from the US.  

So I posted about it on FB (in a general sense, not mentioning my former job although everyone knows what it was and why the topic was interesting to me).  Someone asked specifically about my former org, and I responded ""I have no idea...I have met the staff from India and they seem professional and like they are doing a good job, and we have checks and balances and good governance in place because we do have experience with corruption in India, but if EVERYONE is in cahoots, as it seems they are from this book, then there's no real way to know, is there?""    I was being honest.  I wasn't a marketing person, don't do spin, and I was mostly just reacting to this very disturbing book in what I consider a somewhat personal, not professional venue.    There were a lot of serious responses, including one from a friend who does mission work in Kenya, agreeing about the difficulty of working in a corrupt country where you really can't tell.

So my former boss responds to that thread,  asking if I'm doing drugs or drinking a lot in a really nasty, confrontational way, and I responded to her, all earnest, saying that the book was really disturbing and it was making me think a lot and reframe in my mind stuff that I thought was one way, but that could have been completely different...and she called me and yelled that I was saying to the whole world that everything she had been working on and for for the last 6 years was a lie.  I tried to respond that no, I wasn't saying that *at all* but she was too pissed and hung up on me after saying some really nasty stuff.  I tried to apologize and ended up deleting the entire post but I feel like shit.  

I don't use Facebook for professional stuff *at all,* even though they tried for years to make us post their marketing campaigns and solicit for donations through our personal social media.  To ME, Facebook is a place to share thoughts, books, have conversations (light and heavy) and I was using it that way.  Was I an asshole or just should have known better or was that fine and she overreacted because I hit a nerve?  AITA?  

EDIT:  Thanks guys, I ended up deleting the post and posting an apology/explanation, saying that I didn't intend to question our staff or organization.  My former boss emailed and thanked me for that and we're all good.

22,NTA,AITA for wanting to be liked?,"My friend of 3 years hasn't been speaking to me a lot lately. I've been trying to keep in touch and hang out but gotten almost no response. Finally today, after a comment thread on FB with other people as well, he tells me we can't hang out one on one bc he's a guy and I'm a girl and he doesn't want to hurt his new girlfriend. He says it in a condescending way that implies he doesn't want to see me at all any more so I replied a little snarkily that I had been wanting to hang out in a group and that if he didn't want to be friends any more I would have appreciated prior notice before he started acting like this and ignoring my texts. I thought he was just being a little rude and it would blow over in five minutes. Then he proceeded to tell me that in fact he didn't want to be friends any more because I'm a bad influence on him. He says I am a flirt and that I enjoy the social influence that buys me. He also says I am manipulative and play mind games with people and have hurt a lot of my friends, and that it feels like I've been trying to keep him and his girlfriend apart.

He gave me no specific examples of who I had hurt or what I had specifically said. I have been told that I come across as a flirt before, but my personality is just to be friendly with people and joke around and tease them-- I'm not being touchy-feely with them, or complimenting their appearance, or anything like that, just trying to be friendly and banter. But nobody except him has accused me of doing that on purpose to have more power over people or to hurt them. As for his relationship, I've let him literally cry on my shoulder about this girl. I've suggested before when they were broken up that maybe he should move on but told him that it was his decision to make and that I would support him no matter what.

I will admit that I do work really hard to try and be a charming and well-liked person. I have tried to become better friends with ""cool"" people because I'm tired of being seen as a super weird girl and a loser. I don't think that I'm better than other people who are nerdy and stuff-- I freely admit I'm a huge nerd and most of my friends are as well. And those are the people I still spend the vast majority of my time with. I just really want to be liked, and honestly sometimes it feels like a break to be away from some of my friends who attract attention with their awkwardness. I know it's shallow of me. Sometimes when I do nice things I don't do them just because I want to be helpful, but because I want a better relationship with the person or because I want to be a good person and want to be known for that.

And I'm really afraid that that makes me a manipulator, or that I really am hurting everybody I know all the time and they just don't tell me. I have been confronted before when I have done something specific to someone and immediately apologized and worked to fix things, but it has not been for anything this guy is talking about. I asked other friends about this situation and they all said that no, I'm not manipulative and that this guy is being mean, but I really just want an outside perspective. I'm losing our entire friendship over this until he decides I'm a better person (yes, he said that). We have the same friend groups, we're on the same quiz team, and we're in the same social club, so all of this is going to be messy and awkward and I don't know what to do now. Am I the asshole or is he?

TL;DR I thought I was being friendly and dealing with my mistakes when they happened. Friend says I'm a manipulator and a bad influence who hurts everyone. Don't know what's right.",2015-07-14 20:45:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3darns/aita_for_wanting_to_be_liked/,10,4,0.75,0

26,NTA,Roommate moved his girlfriend and dog in for a month and his outraged when I asked to split the rent 3 ways.,"*edit- Was supposed to read, ""is outraged"" in title.

I'm in a 2 bedroom apartment with a roommate. Our lease is up in 2 days and his plan was to move out and find a place with his girlfriend. My plan was to move out and find another roommate. Last week he sends me a text saying he's staying another month. This is ok for me since I hadn't nailed down a new roommate or place yet either. 

Monday night (2 days ago) I come home from work to find our place chock full of moving boxes and new furniture. His girlfriend, who got evicted from her other place, is suddenly here living his room with the rest of her stuff strewn out throughout the apartment. AND her dog. He didn't tell me because he, ""didn't think I'd care.""

Today, nearing the end of the month, I wanted to confirm we're splitting the rent 3 ways. They can both afford it; she's actually the one with the job in the relationship (he has GI bill military income each month). He told me there was no way in hell that was happening because she's his guest and not a tenant. I surveyed the massive piles of boxes and gestured but that only set him off further. Anyway, apparently that's the end of the discussion. 

Am I the asshole here?

----

Update - She just got home and said the same thing he did. Visit to the leasing office first thing tomorrow.

----

Update 2, 7/30/15 10:50am

I asked the leasing office to please send me a copy of the contract as they weren't open yet this morning when the stopped by. The lovely lady very quickly accommodated and sent over the fine print. I mucked through the legalese and found these two exciting clauses:

""**34. PETS:** No pets are permitted without the prior written consent of the Landlord. Any such consent may be revoked at any time, with or without cause, by giving ten (10) days written notice. Except to the extent written permission is given, pets may not be brought upon the Premises, whether such pets belong to Resident(s) or to any other person. **The presence of any pets as to which written permission has not been given and is not currently in force, even if such pets are ""just visiting"", shall be deemed a material and incurable breach of this Lease and shall be cause for the service of a three-day notice terminating the tenancy.** This policy does not apply to service animals.""

""**Visitors**

Tenant acknowledges that his guests are his responsibility that they will park in only designated parking areas and that they will adhere to all the apartment rules. Visitors are limited to a 5 days day stay. Visitors staying longer than 5 days days must notify Management in writing.""

Checkmate.

----

Update 3, 7/30/15 4:00pm

Roommate obviously noticed the signs of me packing up and asked if I was moving out. I said I had nothing to say to him. I plan on talking to the leasing people tomorrow. He came back an hour later and said, ""Just so you know, if you don't pay August rent I will sue you in Small Claims Court.""

I told him to have a nice day.

----

Update 4, 7/30/15 11:48pm

I have completely moved out. The leasing people, who I talked with for an hour, were *exceedingly* unhelpful. If I ever want to be able to legally move out of there I have to have him co-sign a ""roommate separation agreement"" and he. will. not. sign. it.

They tell me that I wouldn't even be able to be eligible to get my deposit back until both of us move out. I asked what that meant if he stayed there for 5 years and the woman shrugged at me. They say also that anything that is problematic with the apartment while she's there is my responsibility too because my name is on the lease. ""You're telling me that my roommate brings an uninvited guest and her dog against my wishes, I report it, and I'll get in trouble for having an unauthorized pet?""

""Your name is on the lease."" the woman said and stared blankly.

Later, in an unfortunate fit of rage while loading/packing, her stupid dog walked past me in the hallway while the front door was open because I was carrying things. I yelled, ""GET OUT!"" at it. 

Looking worried it ran outside and she chased it. I closed the door and locked it. Not like she has a key. Anyway he threatened to call the cops. I told him go ahead, but he backed down. After talking with my parents they suggested, ""Oh why don't you talk to dear family friend, the attorney who specializes in real estate whose husband is a realtor and they are our neighbors and you practically were an older brother to their daughter?""

*facepalm because I completely forgot about that wonderful woman* ""Yes, please, dad. Would you please call her and ask if it's ok for me to get her advice?""

He sent off a voicemail and an email. Hopefully I will get in touch tomorrow. I am exhausted and going to bed.

----

**FINAL UPDATE** 8/3/15  6:53pm PST

On Friday I wrote a formal letter and sent it to the leasing office and CCed the roommate stating I had moved out, new person had moved in with dog, I wish to give notice, he wont let me off lease, etc. I also stated I would be pursuing small claims court action. I did.  Then I went to the local small claims court and submitted California SC-100 form for 3 months rent, my deposit, and an extra $1000 for potential pet damages against the roommate. 3 months is because court dates can take a while and if I wasn't allowed off the lease I would have to be compensated. I had no expectation of getting this money; what I wanted was to be able to walk away free and clear. That was the alternative I planned to present to him.

I received a text on Friday evening from the roommate that I had been released from the lease. I know he had not received the paperwork yet, so this was likely a response to the text I sent him that said, ""hey I need you to pay me $4200"" as required by law (I have to ask for it before taking legal action). The leasing company made it clear I still had to give 30 days notice so today being the 3rd I had to visit the office and pay my half of the $1875 rent so I could walk away. I was prepared for that outcome.

I asked for my copy of the release form he signed and then inquired about the rent I had to pay. Apparently he added his girlfriend and her dog to the lease. She is on the lease. Their names are on the lease. ""Wait,"" I said, ""does this mean I don't have to pay for August?""

In true bureaucratic form they answered, ""Your name is not on the lease.""

I blinked and stared. ""I'm... free?""

""Your name is not on the lease.""

""Can I get that in writing?"" I inquired, starting to feel a twinge of hope.

""That's what this release form is. It was signed on the 31st. You claim to have moved out. Your name is not on the lease.""

""Would you like my keys?"" I asked

""We can take them or you can give them to your old roommate.""

""Thanks I'd like to never see him again. Here is the door key and here is the postal box key. You have been wonderful. Goodbye""

Then I left. I am now on my 3rd beer and happy as a clam. I will call off the lawsuit ASAP. They are paying the full rent for August and the foreseeable future.

27,NTA,AITA For wanting her to be with me and not him,"First I want to list the people that are involved in this situation. First off there's the main girl we'll call her M (I will also refer to M and ""her"") then there is the guy we'll call him D(I will also refer to D as ""him""), there is another girl that I had a thing with we'll call her H, my ex is also apart of this story we'll call her S, and of course me. We are all in high school although D is a grade higher than me and M. M and I have been friends for about 6 months now and I have grown to like her a lot. We have similar personalities and have gone through a lot of the same shit in life, making it very easy for her and I to sympathize with each other on most everything.

In the beginning of our friendship I was talking to and pursuing H, I had no idea that M might like me at all. Eventually the thing with H fell through. After it fell through I had a conversation with M, where I learned that M liked me before she knew I had a thing with H, she then told me that she no longer liked me and had moved on. After this I started dating S and M started to have a thing with D, I was happy in my relationship and I was happy for her.

Long story short I broke up with S and decided that I was done with relationships for awhile. I was still happy for M and D they never officially started dating but they were happy together and what did I care. As school ended and summer began M and I were talking and Skyping a lot, during these conversations we grew very close. I learned that her best friend and her were having a fight and weren't really talking. So in away I became her person she talk to. 

In the middle of summer M and D hadn't gone on a signal date or seen each other, the last time they had seen each other was the last day of school. M had told me that she wasn't really interested in dating D and only wanted to be good friends with D but didn't want to push D away so she said nothing to him about being just friends. So at this point I thought that they weren't dating and that she didn't like him. One day we were texting and she mentioned that she had just had an amazing day with D at a local theme park, I guess this ""date"" had changed her feelings for him. I started to ask questions about her day and what it was like. What I found out is that M and D aren't officially ""dating"" but they have a ""thing"" whatever that means. 

The next day we were Skyping and I told her that I liked her and that I have feelings for her, M told me that she likes me as well but she also likes D at the same time, she said that she knows that its a bad thing to feel and that it wasn't fair to either me or D. We continue our conversation like nothing happened. In other Skype conversations I tried to bring up the whole topic of her liking me and D, but most of the time she would avoid the question or talk about something else. The one time that I did get her to talk about it was when she listed the pros and cons of both me and D. Both me and D had about the same Pros (She says that we're very similar, I don't know him to well), my one con was that I wasn't in her friend group and D's one con was that he was a year older than her. Neither of these cons being that bad.

Moving this long story up to just a few days ago. While I was texting her she seemed kinda out of it and wasn't really in the conversation, if that makes any sense. Anyways I asked her what was on her mind and she replied with a wall of text. This wall of text basically said that M was feeling pathetic because she can't face anything coming towards her (I'm assuming she meant the situation with me and D) M also said that I really likes D but he tries to fix everything and be her shrink but all she wants him to do is to listen but she doesn't think he capable of just listening. She went on and said ""And you, oh you are just, basically perfect, and that's actually really annoying because I want to just like D and be done with it but I can't because when I talk to you it reminds me of what he isn't. And I hate that. I really don't like it. But it's there. And I don't know what to do with it. And I feel awful for feeling that, because it's not fair to either of you."" Honestly, I don't know what to take from this part of the text, but now you're caught up to present day, My question is am I the asshole For wanting her to be with me and just go up to her and ask her to be my girlfriend and not be with D ?  Feed back and questions are welcome.

TLDR: She likes him and me and has told me this, I like her ( I have told her this) and want her to be with me and not him.

28,YTA,AITA for lashing out at my friend earlier.,"I have this friend who lives in my neighborhood. We will call him, Dom. We've been friends for about 7 years now so we're pretty close. 
He has a habit of coming to my house at points even if I state that I don't want company at the moment. This goes on a lot and I just usually reject him at the door or let him in.

Today I acted a bit different though. He had told me the previous day that he'd come to my house the next day. I didn't specify whether that'd be okay or not. The next day he came over, I wasnt feeling too hot so I just didn't answer the door. Not too long after I decide to go outside and he's sitting on my front porch waiting for me to come out or something. I brought out a little water gun cause he wouldn't leave and got him with it a few times **(this was more playful than anything no one was angry or upset).**

After a bit he actually leaves.

He then waits till my parents come home and then proceeds to try to walk in my house because they both like him. I heard the front door open and I realize who it was coming in the house. This pissed me off. I proceeded to walk out of my room, stop him before he actually walks to far in my house and just yell **""I told you no, Dom. Go away, get out!""**

A bit of awkward silence cause I'm not known to yell at people. Anyways after he walks out my parents and I have a bit of talk.

After some thinking I actually feel kind of bad about it and I'm not sure if I was just an asshole then.

So reddit, am I the asshole?

Terry: we're hanging out at Jacob's at 8:00, you're invited

Me: delightful

Terry: was that sarcasm?

Terry: I think it was

Me: no

Terry: I know somebody else

Terry: who does that thing you're doing now

Me: I just woke up from a rather ineffective nap. I'm not a great conersationalist at the moment

Terry: want me to help you?

Terry: I'll do it anyways

Terry: the ideal response was either a ""I'll be there"" or ""I'm staying home tonight""

Me: I'll be there

Me: you condescending twat

Terry: lol

Terry: I have another friend who fucks that up every goddamn day

Terry: on purpose

Terry: and it drives me goddamn crazy because they'll say something cryptic after being invited to something and I won't actually know if they're coming or not

Me: Good, I'll have to be sure to do it more if you're going to be such a condescending prat about it

Terry: You're only being like that because you're not on the recieving end

Terry: so you don't know how frustrating it can be

Terry: to herd this group of cats we call friends

Me: ""I have another friend who fucks that up"", ""want me to help you?""""You're only being like that...""
 
Me: If this is the mood you're in, I think I'll pass today.

Terry: stop being so sensitive

Terry: you want an explanation of why I was so annoyed? fine

Terry: Our plans literally hinge on whether you wanted to come or not

Terry: plus my mother wouldn't leave me alone about what my plans were later tonight and I couldn't give her an answer

Terry: and it was time sensitive

Terry: and then when you do actually respond to the message I send you, I still don't know whether you're coming or not

Terry: and then you send me another message and I still don't know

Terry: and then you send me another message and I still don't know.

Terry: And I don't think you're aware of this, but everyone who talks to you on IM has no clue if the next message they will recieve from you will be in 3 seconds or 30 minutes.

Terry: so sorry if I'm I wasn't totally patient with you today

Terry: happy?

Me: At the moment, I'm sincerely trying to make the calculated deicision of whether or not we're going to enjoy ourselves tonight, which puts a strain on my powers of prescience, seeing as that's a faculty I lack. A (short-tempered) apology (with several comments on my ultimate responsibility in the matter), no matter how sincere, was not my ultimate  aim. Because right now it seems to me that tempers on either end could spark up at this point, and then we'd all have to enjoy that awkward nightmare.

So I'm going to stay here tonight. We'll pick up game night on better terms.

Me: It may be a surprise to note that I was quite on edge yesterday as well, and I wouldn't have trusted my own temperment had I not already made plans before I found myself in that situation. I am not going to tempt fate on that matter now.

Terry: It was very clear that you didn't have your heart set on hanging out yesterday

Me: Yes, it occurred in the intevening time between 6 and 6:30, hence our lateness

Terry: That was my assumption too, but it's not really my business

Me: It was Jacob's assumption, and he did consider his business to the extent that he wanted to confirm it.

Me: That's neither here nor there

Terry: also, this isn't ""A mood"" that I'm in, I always communicate like this. I think that people forget that when they're having a bad day because it gives them an excuse to get mad at somebody.

Terry: Have you ever seen me flip out on somebody during a game night? Can you even imagine what that would look like?

Terry: because I can't

Terry: I leave my significant grievances at the door. I only hold on to the petty, comedy-inducing ones.

Terry: so if you think that you're gonna have fun then show up and if you don't think you're gonna have fun don't show up, but you can be sure that if I make the decision to participate, I'm gonna try to have a good time.

Me: Then let me rephrase. I consider solely myself a liability this evening and I have no intention nor desire to come. I'll extend the offer to [my girlfriend, a usual member], but I am clearly not able to enjoy the fesitivites

Me: She's not particularly interested. I'm sure that comes as no surprise, but I thought I'd at least entertain the possibility.

Me: My apologies for ruining the plans this evening",2015-08-24 02:01:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3i5ffi/aita_for_getting_too_defensive/,9,2,0.58,0

31,YTA,[AITA] for wanting my landlord to get a light installed?,"I guess this post should really be titled ""would I be the asshole if..."" because I haven't actually done anything yet but I want to know how appropriate it would be.

So about a month and a half ago my landlord had a ceiling fan installed in my room. That was awesome and all, but it also involved installing a new light. 

Now as you may or may not know, you can't install a light above a fan - it would flicker and just generally be awful. So the new light is in the corner of my room, above my desk. But even in a fairly small room like mine, that leaves the opposite side of the room fairly dark most of the time. It's unpleasant and slightly depressing, is what I'm saying.

My question is simply this - would I be the asshole if I asked to have another light installed on the opposite side of the room? I'd be happy to buy the light myself and put some money towards the installation costs too, but I don't know how much would be right to offer. 

It feels like if I asked it would be like saying ""sorry, but the money and effort you spent on improving my room isn't good enough for me, I want you do *more*."" When it was first done I mentioned how dark the room was and I got the impression she thought I was being ungrateful about it - I backtracked a little and said I'd see if I got used to it, but I don't think it's going to get any better.

32,YTA,AITA for not feeling responsible for friends who drink and drive then wind up hurt.,"After a happy hour a coworker ""Sansa"" (that my buddy/coworker ""Petyr"" is crushing on) decided it was time to go and Petyr thought she might have been a little too buzzed to drive. Sansa says she felt fine. He tried his best to convince her as much as he could including getting perhaps a little too touchy, but she wasn't feeling his advice.

So after she leaves Petyr gets all butthurt about it and starts complaining about how awful she and drunk divers all are. I tell him sometimes you just gotta let people do what they do and you can't stop them. He tried, but he should leave it as that.

Then he starts talking about all the supposed victims that there might be and I just tell him that responsibility is on them and not him. He asks me if I ever knew anyone who got hurt or killed by drunk driving and I said yes but maintain that I don't consider it my responsibility beyond offering a friend a place to crash, if they feel like they need it. If they don't, I let them go.

He told me I was monster for this. We haven't spoken since. Am I really that bad? I think he's a little too controlling, but maybe I'm wrong. I mean he cares about victims of drunk driving and that's cool, but I don't know if that's just a convenient way for him to claim moral superiority?

EDIT: Since it's not clear, neither myself nor any of my coworkers got sloppy drunk. we all hung out for about 2 hours or so and had 2 or 3 drinks. Nobody was two-stepping or slurring their speech .

34,YTA,AITA for not liking my dog?,"This all started when, along with my partner, I made one of the worst decisions of my life.  And that was was to get a puppy the exact same day as I was about to begin 6 months paternity leave with our 6 month old first child.  Now, I had never been a dog owner before, or a father to a baby.  So both were new experiences to me.   I had no idea (naive maybe?) how much time, effort and attention a puppy needed.  So whilst stressed to fuck with a new baby, and on top of that a puppy that constantly needed feeding, taking out for shits/pisses, wiping up the accidents, it's safe to say that my head was going.  Fast forwards 3 years, and my son is now 3 and half years, our dog is around the same age and now we have a new baby on the way.  I find myself getting more and more annoyed with said dog.  Taking it out for the necessary walks three times a day are becoming more and more of a chore and I can't see things getting any easier when the new baby arrives.  It's got to the point where it's not that I don't have the time for the dog, it's just that most things he does annoys me. Don't get me wrong, I have my moments when I'm like, fuck man, sort your shit out.  This dog is amazing.  He's always been great with my son, has never shown any aggression and generally just does dog things.  But still, I just get annoyed at the smallest things like when he follows me around the house.

35,YTA,AITA for lying all the time?,"Hey guys,

so I know that nobody likes a liar. Neither do I. But somehow I just can't help myself - whenever a little lie is much more convenient than the truth and I know that nobody cares enough to check the facts, I lie.

Sometimes it's just that the lie is easier to explain. For example, if someone asks me why I look so tired, the answer might be that before going to bed, I spilled a huge mug of tea behind my counter and I spent half the night taking my kitchen apart and trying to soak up the moisture. But it's easier to just say ""I didn't sleep well"".

When I'm late because I spent too much time on reddit and forgot that I still had to take a shower, I will say that I took the wrong train because I feel like that's somehow more excusable. However, I would never say that an old lady fell at the stairs and I stayed with her until an ambulance arrived. Even if it actually happened, I would probably still go with ""wrong train"".

And if I tell a funny story, I add a ton of details hoping to make it more entertaining.

On more serious issues, I'm completely honest though. And I never blame anyone else for my mistakes, I usually just find a more likeable excuse.

Is this just an annoying behaviour that I should keep trying to overcome (I'm working on it) or does it really make me an asshole?",2015-11-26 23:24:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3uej5e/aita_for_lying_all_the_time/,12,14,0.83,0
36,YTA,AITA for not hanging out with girlfriend on her Bday,"So back in August I met this girl (we'll call her Jessica). Jessica and I started talking a lot and in early September we started dating. The relationship was pretty casual. We go to different schools so I would only get to see her on the weekends. Most of the time we would watch a movie or get food together. From what I could tell we were both pretty content with the direction the relationship was headed. 

*Before the story starts I want to lay out a few dates to prevent confusion:* 

**Finals Week**: November 2nd-6th

**SAT and Jessica's birthday**: November 7th

The first week of November was a stressful one for me. I had to take 5 finals (trimester schedule) and the following Saturday I had the SAT (I'm a junior in high school). To add insult to injury that Saturday was also Jessica's birthday. Obviously I wanted to make it special for her but I knew I was going to be completely exhausted by the end of the week. 

Friday after school Jessica and I were texting back and forth trying to figure out plans for her birthday tomorrow. This was my first time taking the SAT so I told her I'd most likely be free around 1 in the afternoon. Jessica tells me that should work because the rest of the night she is going to the mall with friends and getting dinner with her family. I also text her wishing her a happy birthday and give her a heads up that we will play tomorrow by ear because I will most likely be to exhausted to hang out. That night I purposely get to bed early with the intention to be rested enough to hang out Jessica. The whole night I was tossing and turning because I was so anxious about the SAT and making the day special for Jessica. 

Saturday morning I'm up bright and early at 7 AM and head over to the testing center. I text Jessica one more time wishing her a happy birthday and that I will text her once I finish the test. Overall the SAT took about 5 hours with the breaks we got in between sections. The test officially ended at 12:50 PM and I was completely exhausted so I got in my car and drove home. At 1 PM as I was about to text Jessica she texts me asking what the plan is. I text her back telling her that I am way to tired to hang out with her and that I need to go home and take a nap. She seems a little disappointed (which is understandable) and I text her back that I'm super sorry and that we can do something special tomorrow (she was busy the rest of the day). Jessica wasn't agreeing to hang out on a different day and eventually she stops responding to my texts.

Late Saturday night (like 11 PM) she texts me out of the blue asking if she can rant to me. I tell her yes and then she proceeds to write me a number of essays about how pissed off she is at me. She complains to me about how I ""blew her off on her birthday"" and that I ""was probably hanging out with other people anyways."" She also goes off on me about how it didn't seem like I cared. The first time she texted me I responded saying how I am sorry and that if we hung out I feel like I wouldn't have been able to make the day special for her and stuff. She keeps texting me and isn't accepting my apology so eventually I stop saying I'm sorry and I try to explain my side to her. I genuinely didn't do anything except go home, put on the TV, and fall asleep after the SAT. She kept accusing me of not caring and I eventually just tell her we need to hang out tomorrow and work it out in person.

Sunday comes around (the day she was very adamant about being to busy to hang out on) and we go out and get food at Panera. The whole time it was kind of awkward and we were just making small talk. As I am driving her back to her house, I tell Jessica that we should probably break up. I explain to her that I really enjoy spending time with her but I don't think it's working out. She agrees and I tell her that I hope we can still be friends. She seemed very content with the situation and she didn't freak out or get mad at me. I thought we ended the relationship on pretty good terms and I thought I handled the situation pretty maturely.

On Thanksgiving I wake up and she a text on my phone from Jessica. She said: **""Happy Thanksgiving!! So thankful we broke up omfg""** 

As soon as I read that text I got extremely pissed off and headed straight for the gym. Haven't texted her back or contacted her in anyway.

38,YTA,AITA for locking out my flatmate?,"So I have 2 flatmates, and all of us had one set of keys each to the apartment. We are all students living in the apartment because we study abroad. One of the flatmates forgot his keys at his parent's house when he came back after the winter break. So one day before he went out he asked me quickly if I was going to be home later tonight to open the door for him, I quickly said yes, forgetting that I had a class later. So I went on the day and just before the class started I remembered it and ran there. I forgot I said I'd be home because of the stress. After the class, I went by my friend's place (which is about 5 mins from our apartment) and we all decided to go eat in town and called a cab. I then checked my phone and the flatmate was locked out and I asked him to come and get the keys from my friend's apartment, because we had a cab waiting (I didn't tell him about the cab until later). He got really pissed about having to go all the way to my friend's place. 
I've known him a while before and we casually hung out but I started to realize he's quite selfish and arrogant, and he was generally a bad flatmate (e.g. not washing dishes/cleaning after him even after pointing it out).

39,YTA,AITA for this teen drama,"This actually happened many years ago but I thought back to it recently and wondered if I was an asshole for what I did.

Essentially me and a friend both had a crush on a girl. He came forwards and told me about his feelings for her, being his friend I agreed to try and wingman for him, he had no idea I liked her. We were talking every so often and I was dropping hints and trying to find out how she felt about him.

Anyway, the one fateful day at a party I was talking to her and being drunk me after failing for most of the evening to get them together asked her if she had any feelings for him or found him attractive at all. No way apparently, she figured out ages ago that he liked her but didn't want to flat out reject him.

Here's where I'm potentially the asshole, a little while later I take my chance figuring that since their situation was now clearly a no no it was ok. Things went pretty well and understandably he was pissed.

To be honest I'm pretty sure I'm an asshole here but I would like to know how much of an asshole.

40,ESH,AITA for confronting someone with the lack of facts in what they claim to be their factual opinion? (lots to read),"**Preface (feel free to skip):** So I came across this reddit-post on /r/misc which looked like someone plugging their own blog-post, which is allowed on that sub, but I personally disagreed with the content which made me go see whether OP posted it on any other sub where I could see other people's opinions (the post on /r/misc got no responses except for my own).

**Abstract:** OP x-posted this blog-entry on /r/technology where it actually got some attention, and there I saw this other person giving a very biased opinion on the subject. Basically he disagreed with OP, and like I said, I also disagree on some points OP makes but for very different reasons. At first I thought the other person was just a troll, so I only gave a 2-word response (which will be linked down below), but ever since this turned into a pretty ""interesting"" 2-day discussion, getting more and more off topic but in essence what made me hold a grudge (not a personal grudge mind you) was the fact that not only were his arguments not backed up by any facts (especially in the beginning), he very much claimed them to be factual.

Two years ago i was dating a girl called Amanda, we had been together for the better part of three months. She invited me to a banquet for her sorority where it would be announced that she won their presidential election. For the record I agreed to this banquet three weeks ahead of time. 

fast forward two weeks: on Monday (the banquet was that Friday) I got a call from my Dad, He was fishing in an annual ed fish tournament. Every year I hoped that I would get a call that they had an open spot on the team. This was that call, the catch was that I had to be in Houston (a five hour drive) by Thursday night, making me miss the banquet. I said yes to my Dad immediately as this was something that I had been aching to do for years. 

As soon as I got off the phone, I went to lunch with Amanda and broke the news. She was obviously upset which is something I do feel bad about. I do not however regret going, the argument is that this is something that Amanda should never forgive me for. Which she said she did. I don't think I did anything that bad because it was something I really really cared about. 

So Reddit am I an asshole for missing something important to her and doing something important to me?

Oombao desired pizza. The first step to making pizza is cleaning the kitchen. Oombao cleaned the kitchen.

""You've left the knife edge-down on a plate again. I've told you repeatedly not to do that and now I'm going to have to sharpen it again. Also you've dirtied two cutting boards, and there's rice all over the counter. You have made a mess.""
Jiebaseo stated that Oombao was picking on them, and had a nap. When they awoke, Oombao had re-cleaned the kitchen and was now in a bad mood. Oombao was not polite in informing Jiebaseo of this reality.
Jiebaseo again stated that they were being picked on, and suggested that the house would be cleaner if it had fewer things in it, namely the possessions belonging to Oombao; and it would be were they all absent.

46,ESH,AITA for trying to learn if my best friend's boyfriend is cheating on her?,"**Disclaimer:** I know this is stupidly long. It's been really eating away at me, so any feedback/advice would be appreciated. 

After just reading the title, I would definitely call myself an asshole. Let me provide some context, but preface this by saying I had nothing but good intentions.

Me and D have been best friends for about eight years now, and for awhile, she's been one of the only girl friends that I have. She has a history of having very unstable, chaotic relationships, and she has a tendency to jump from one relationship to the next. She broke up with her emotionally manipulative boyfriend of two years in March, and has tried (unsuccessfully) to reenter two serious relationships since then, and then had some FWBs after being rejected by them. D is the type of girl that's very easily offended and will pick fights over stupid things (we're 25, and she stopped talking to me for a month because I didn't offer her a glass of water when she came over and she decided that this was indicative of my selfish character as a friend). 

Anyway, we both have had this triend, J, for years. He's your standard ""nice guy"" who always wanted more from both of us during different periods of time, but we both saw him as a big brother. If either me or D hung out with him alone, he would buy that person dinner, smoke that person out, fill up that person's gas tank, etc. When D entered her long term relationship, J stopped talking to her completely and started spending all of his time with me. When I got a boytriend, he stopped talking to me altogether. It hurt, to be honest, because I always made it very clear that I saw him as exclusively a friend, but I respected his wishes. When D broke up with her asshat boyfriend, she and J started hanging out again, and she constantly referred to him as annoying. I moved across the country, and she promised to come visit me but had concern that J wanted to come and he was ""so annoying."" She never came to visit, shit happens. 

I guess now would be an appropriate time to mention that D had a slight opiate problem, and decided to get clean (words can't express how proud I am of her). J was with her throughout the entire process. She briefly told me about what went on about a week after the fact, and then sort of stopped talking to me altogether - she stopped answering my texts, didn't return my calls. I didn't think too much of it because I did move away, and I understand people can talk less frequently with distance. After a few weeks, I was starting to feel a bit hurt and missed my friend.

Then, something popped up on Facebook that I never, ever expected happening: D and J are in a relationship. 

I immediately texted her and congratulated her, despite my shock. She always referred to J as being incredibly unattractive, and would joke about how badly he wanted her. Part of me thought that she got together with him because the girl can't stand the thought of being alone and had been rejected by the past three men she developed feelings for. But mainly, I was so happy because J had always been a sweet, attentive guy who cared for her. D sent me a brief text explaining that she had fallen for him throughout her detox, and then ghosted me again for another two weeks. I decided to give her space.

Well, a couple days ago, I received a notification that J had signed up for Kik. I thought this was odd, since he's a rather isolated dude and from my experience and knowledge, Kik is used primarily for sexting/somewhat private IMing. His profile picture was of him shirtless.

So I sent him a message saying, ""what are you doing on here?"" He asked who I was, and **here's where I might have started to become the asshole.** 

Since I was sketched out, I remained ambiguous and told J that he had asked for me to add him awhile ago to trade pics. I decided to see if he was being faithful to D, and asked to trade pictures with him. He immediately sent me a picture of a chick sucking a dick - I couldn't tell whose dick it was, and I didn't know the girl, but a reverse image search suggested that he didn't get it off the Internet.

So I continued to play the role of catfish, because I wanted to see if he was actually going to sext a stranger after entering a relationship with my best friend. I sent him pictures of some random chick in return, and he continued to send me face pics. I asked if he thought I was cute, and he said ""yes"" and that he was happy that I messaged him. When I asked him if he was single, he said ""it's complicated."" I told him that ""I"" didn't want to be involved with someone that was attached, and his response was ""I never said that I wasn't single."" 

At this point I felt disturbed enough that I needed to tell D what was going on. I took screenshots of the conversation and I tried calling her; no response. I texted her saying that I had something important to tell her and asked her to call me when she was alone; her response was that she had schoolwork to do and just to text her. The rest of the conversation went something like this:

>Me: Are you and J in an open relationship or are you monogamous? I have something really important to tell you that I'd rather say on the phone.

>D: If you're polygamous, I'm sorry but I honestly don't really wanna hear about it because I consider it being unfaithful and I think it's nasty

>M: It's not about me. Can you please just call me?

>D: Why can't you just text it to me

>M: Because text messages can be construed the wrong way, and I would like to be able to provide the correct context. Trust me, you'll see texts. 

>D: I can't talk on the phone right now, just text me.

>M: So I got an alert this morning saying that ""J"" joined kik. Kik is a private instant messaging app that people generally use for sexting or drug deals. I thought it was weird that he had it, so I sent him a msg asking what he was doing on there. He didn't deem to know it was me, so I got a bad feeling and played into it. I pretended to be some girl. 

At this point, J messaged me on Kik saying, ""How's [state I moved to]? Have a good time at that wedding this weekend?"" 

>And then: ""It's D, M. What's up? Lol."" 

>So I texted D back, saying:

>>""So if you're with him right now, and if you're the one responding to me on Kik, it's important to know that he has the capability to delete messages. I have screenshots of the entire conversation. Are you typing to me right now from Kik? I'm trying to do the right thing and help you."" 

>D: I just read all of it and yes that was me.

>M: [sent her all the screenshots]

>D: I already read them before you told me about it. I already saw all that.

>And then on J's Kik: 
>>Yeah he told me about it earlier today and that he was pretty sure it was you so he fucked with you

>M to D: Well, I hope that he genuinely was fucking with me, because I'd be concerned if [my boyfriend] were sending random pictures to a stranger on kik.

And then nothing - she ghosted me again.

I know that I overstepped my boundaries here, and that it wasn't my place to try and see if he'd cheat on her. But I did it all out of love for my friend - and I'm uncomfortable with the lack of acknowledgement on her part. 

I miss my friend, and I'm not sure why she's been distancing me so much lately. What can I do to rectify this situation? Should I apologize? Should I give her space? I'm genuinely just seeking honest feedback on this matter - I want to make things right, it seems like my interference here just pushed her farther away. Can I have your thoughts, Reddit?

**TLDR** My best friend got into a relationship with our mutual friend, who randomly created a Kik. I catfished him to try and find out his intentions and showed the messages to her, but she claims to have already known about them.

47,ESH,AITA for ruining my girlfriend's concert?,"To put it shortly a few weeks ago me and my girlfriend went to a concert together. Neither of us are the party/concert/club/etc types but she likes that stuff occasionally and she begged me to go with her to this concert. I went with her and pretended to enjoy it for the first part of it but then she went off to dance with a group of strangers. She asked first if I wanted to come with her to dance with them, I declined, then she immediately walked off to dance with them.

I got a bit upset at this because I came to an event that I hated and felt extremely uncomfortable with because she begged me to and now she isn't even keeping me company. When she got back from dancing I was obviously annoyed and upset and wasn't able to pretend I liked the event anymore. She noticed this, asked what's wrong, I told her, she just dismissed it

The next 1/3rd of the concert was pretty much me obviously annoyed and failing to fake enjoyment. Then another group of strangers started dancing, she asked if I wanted to. I said no, she asked if she could go off to dance with them. I told her she can but I'm going to leave the event because I'm not staying alone at an event I hate. She was understandably pissed at me after that. We had a fight and made up but I'm still not sure who was the asshole here.

I know I overreacted, but I would never leave her side at an event when I know she's uncomfortable and hating the event. Especially not to dance with people I don't even know.",2016-09-12 04:15:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/52cl3n/aita_for_ruining_my_girlfriends_concert/,6,11,0.83,0
48,YTA,AITA for how I talked to another user on deviantART?,"Now I'm not going to name this user of course. Also they've since deleted the journal that this happened on in question, so I'll be paraphrasing.

So this user has made various depressive journals, and this one in question talked about how they wished they could make all humans disappear and undo the damage we've done. I took a bit of umbrage to this idea, and told them that I disagreed and thought that we should better ourselves from what we've done, instead of trying to redo what we lost.

He responds be saying how he doesn't see a point to life, and that he has a respect for mother nature and thinks that he thinks it's better to undo humanity and that we refuse to better our impact on the Earth.

I respond by saying as someone who once suffered from depression and better myself from it, I understand how they feel, but don't see a point in being so depressively pessimistic as a result. I then explain how we never intended to damage the Earth, and only really noticed our impact in the last few decades, and that we should try to better ourselves with what we have instead of trying redo what was lost because of us.

His final response accuses me of looking down on him and thinking I was better then he was, and then tells me to leave his page and don't come back.

Now my response back may have been going too far honestly. I respond by saying I tried to help, but he chose to reject it, and instead decided to wallow in his own self-pity, and how I lost any respect I had for him up to that point.

I have since blocked him, and I assume he did the same.

Now I'm torn. I don't know If I was being to hard on him and overly condescending at all, or if my frustration with him is justified. I have difficulties comprehending my actions sometimes, and I feel this may have been one of those moments.

I don't know, am I the a-hole in this situation?

**Edit:** After reading the comments, yeah, I was being a bit of a dick here. Although I honestly was trying to help the guy out, I shouldn't have presumed I understood him. Also, my final response to him was totally unwarranted, and the result of letting my anger getting the better of me.

49,YTA,AITA for not feeling bad for my oldest sister?,"Tldr at the end...

This side of my family has had many problems and doesn't get along as well as it should. This story is very long and hard to explan though I will try my best.

My mother had my oldest sister at a time when she was too young to understand what she was doing we think, at 19 years old, and wasn't always the best. She didn't have the money to let her do everything she wanted and she made many mistakes by being harder on her than she was with the rest of us. I don't know the full story here and it's hard for me to talk on something I'm not sure of. Even so, from what I can remember, my mother has always tried reaching out to make up for her mistakes and all my oldest sister has done is be worse to her and even more so to my grandparents who have cared for her. She is selfish and rude to everyone of us. I know her life is hard because of her illness (RSD), but even before this it was still true.

Now to this situation, my mother recently told me that she is in the hospital. Apparently she had hallucinated from her antianxiety or antidepressant she had been taking for awhile. We just got the news that she has ulcers inside of her stomach that have been causing an incredible amount of pain.

Even though I don't wish this on her, I just felt emotionless when told this. My mother is emotional about the fact that her oldest child would be more stressed by her (their relationship is incredibly strained) being there than if she just stays away. I find myself just feeling bad for my grandparents and mother and not my sister. She never made any attempt to be a real sister to me throughout my life (she's quite a bit older than me) and I feel no connection as family.

Tldr: Me and my oldest sister have little to no connection due to family tensions my entire life. Am I the asshole for not feeling bad for her when she's in the hospital even though she's technically family?",2016-10-31 14:15:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/5acgc9/aita_for_not_feeling_bad_for_my_oldest_sister/,10,10,0.83,0
50,YTA,AITA for locking my brother outside in the rain?,"General background:
     My brother John(27) and I(21F Jessica) both live at home with our mother and we're both unemployed. John recently got a few days of construction work from our uncle. John and Ma don't really get along much but she trusts him at home.


**My Side:**
     Around 4PM John calls and says he'll be done with work around 7 and that he finally got paid. Around 8 Ma asks me to call him because she has to go to a Christmas party and doesn't want to leave me alone because a string of robberies have occurred nearby. John says he'll be back before 9 since he's hanging out with our cousin Wally(26). I call him at 10 because he still wasn't back, he claims he's still in a magic match but that he's almost finished. At 11:30 I hear knocking on the front door and I see that John's car is in the driveway so I decide to make him wait a few minutes as punishment. 10 minutes later I go to the front door and open it to find John and Wally on the porch. That's when I slammed the door shut in anger and sent them a message to wait for Ma to come back if they wanted to go inside. They waited for a bit then drove off.

   I don't like Wally very much because he encourages John's use of synthetic marijuana and lies about it. I'm pretty goddamn sure they were smoking and lost track of the time. I *would have* let John in if Wally wasn't there, Wally isn't even allowed to stay over for the night so either he *was* going to stay over or they were just passing through. 

**John's side:**
     He was working 4 days straight in misty weather for our asshole uncle. After all that he got paid around $300  and went to the local comic shop to buy the new Commander deck. Then John went to Wally's place because all of John's decks were there and he wanted to replace some cards with the ones he bought. He got the call around 8 that he needs to go back home but he's tired from all the work and wants to test out the new deck against someone who actively plays since Jessica no longer plays magic. Commander games go on for hours, especially when you're testing out new cards and then John got the call at 10:30. He and Wally wrap up the game and drive home but once they get there around 11:15 Jessica doesn't open the door. They knock on the front door and windows until the door finally opens but as soon as it does it gets slammed shut. Jessica just sends them a text telling them to wait for Ma. Once the rain got heavy they leave in the truck.

**tldr**: I locked out my older bro because he was possibly high and stayed out far longer than he was supposed to.

Edit: I should mention that I'm currently injured to the point where I can barely walk and John moved in to be my caretaker during the evening.
Our mother has an order of protection against Wally which is why he's not allowed on the property.",2016-12-24 20:41:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/5k4yfv/aita_for_locking_my_brother_outside_in_the_rain/,26,57,0.94,0
51,YTA,AITA for wanting my live-in girlfriend to not talk on the phone in the morning while I'm trying to sleep?,"I know how things tend to go on this sub. Even though you're supposed to ""describe **both sides in detail**"", most people can't help but let their personal bias bleed through. This post is long because I'm trying really hard to be upfront about my natural biases, but there's a quick **TL;DR** at the bottom if you want the basic, bias-crammed AITA.

I'll (31M) dive right into it: I've been living with my girlfriend (29F) for a year and a half now. We argue here and there like any couple, and have been working on our communication, especially when arguing. 

I'm a light sleeper. She's a heavy sleeper. Always have been. Always will be. She has an earlier sleep schedule than me, so I'm normally still awake for a while at night after she goes to bed, and she's normally awake in the morning while I'm still sleeping. 

At night I put on headphones while watching TV after she goes to bed so I don't wake her. She's now telling me that she never asked me to do that, which is true, but I don't want to run the risk of accidentally waking her.

Normally, when she wakes up before me she's pretty quiet, but she's woken me up before, because it just doesn't occur to her that she's being loud enough to wake me. I don't think it ever crosses her brain, because I think she cannot fathom how someone could be awaken so easily. Meanwhile I'm quiet as a mouse while she's asleep, because I can't fathom how noise *wouldn't* wake her up.

Here comes the asshole part. Last night I went to bed around 3am. (Neither of us have anything to wake up for for a couple of days, so fuck it, I'm staying up and sleeping in.) While she was sleeping, I was my usual mouse-like self. However, this morning she woke up at 8am because she couldn't sleep. I was awoken at 8:30am because she was talking to her friend on the phone. 

In her defense, she was speaking quietly, but what little bass she has in her voice still travels through the wall of our one-bedroom apartment. Although I couldn't hear what she was saying, it sounded like Charlie Brown's parents were talking in the living room just on the other side of the wall by my head. I continued to try to sleep but couldn't. 

For the sake of transparency, at this point I'll admit I did a bit of a dick move. I got up and closed the door somewhat loudly to get the point across that she woke me (I didn't slam it, but it was still loud.) I should have said something, but I was clouded by anger and sleepy head. I laid back down in bed for another ten minutes but she kept talking.

I got up again, accepting my fate of little sleep. She was still on the phone as I got dressed and put the leash on the dog. As I went outside to walk the dog, I heard her say something, but I kept walking out. 

I didn't hear her, assuming she was talking to her friend and not me, but again, I'll be transparent and admit that I left in a bit of a huff. Dick move, but part of us working on our communication is taking a moment to calm down before engaging in the argument. I took some deep breaths as I walked my dog, and prepared to talk to her when I got back.

I walk into the apartment and she's gone. I checked the parking lot and her car was gone too. I check my phone for anything from her, but nothing. This raised my anger again, so I was working on a text that told her off, but realized I should take some time to calm down. 

I deleted my text before I even finished it, browsed Reddit for a couple hours, and calmed down. I still hadn't heard from her, so I decided to break the silence. Here's my text verbatim: ""Mornin' babe! Hope you're having a swell day so far! When ya comin' back? Love you! [cute emojis]""

After another half hour or so she calls me back. She's calm, but says, ""What was going on this morning? I hope you weren't mad for me talking to my friend."" I say, ""Well yes, I was upset that you woke me up so early, but I've calmed down now.""

This triggered her. She starts telling me how she's not going to apologize for talking to her friend. I stay quiet because the only thing coming to my mind is blind anger. She continues telling me how she's not in the wrong. Whenever I tried to defend my position, she would interrupt me with her defense before I could finish. 

More transparency: At this point I'm seething because I'm not being heard, so the third or so time she interrupts me, I hang up on her. (Dick move, I know.) She calls back and I ignore it, then send a text saying, ""I'm mad. I need space.""

She sends me a text back telling me that she's mad too and that I was childish for walking out earlier instead of talking to her. 

This begins a text argument. (So much for space, but it's my fault for engaging.) I wont type out the rest of the argument unless someone has questions about it. It's quite long. The broad strokes are that I told her she's disrespecting my sleep when she's on the phone with her friends. She says she won't be a prisoner in my apartment and she can talk to her friends whenever she wants to.

As I typed this up, we agreed to talk about it later today after I've calmed down. Fair enough. 

I'm bringing this to AITA to find out if I'm really treating her like a prisoner because I expect her to send a text to her friends saying something along the lines of, ""Hey my boyfriend is sleeping. We can text or I can call you in a little bit after he wakes up."" But of course, let me know if I'm being an asshole anywhere else during this tale. If anyone has any questions, I'll be open and honest with my answer because I really want to get to the bottom of this.

**TL;DR:** I'm (31M) a light sleeper, so when my girlfriend (29F) talks with her friends on the phone in the morning, it wakes me up and I get mad.",2017-01-15 21:51:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/5o6o18/aita_for_wanting_my_livein_girlfriend_to_not_talk/,42,56,0.98,0
52,YTA,AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to leave his deodorant out on the counter?,"Pretty much just what the title says. My boyfriend has a habit of leaving his deodorant on the counter instead of in the bathroom. I asked him if he could leave it in the bathroom and he said he likes it on the counter. Then I asked if he could maybe put it on his desk then if he wanted it out in the living area. He then told me to put my purse and pictures and decorations on my desk instead of the counter if that's how I felt about it. I told him it's not because it's his item but because it's something that gets spread on his armpits so it's more a sanitary thing that just having stuff lying around. 

So tell me, am I the asshole for asking him not to leave his deodorant on the counter?

Edit: KITCHEN counter people, not in the bathroom. My bad for not specifying. In any case, I've decided I'm either going to back down completely and learn to live with the minor annoyance, or I might offer that if he keeps it on his desk instead I'll fix/move something of mine that annoys him.

53,YTA,AITA for being mad my roommate for not telling me my timer went off?,"I spent like five hours today making bread - mixing it, kneading it, letting it rise, kneading it again and letting it rise again. I popped it in the oven and put on a timer. Unbeknownst to me, my roommate went downstairs and when the timer went off, she turned it off, she didn't do anything with the oven or bread, texted me to tell me my timer went off, even though I'm right upstairs, and proceeded to just go about her business. I didn't receive the text because I didn't have my phone on me. I realized I hadn't heard the timer go off and went downstairs to check and the bread was way overdone, just a shade below burning, and she's all like, yeah I texted you. I was livid. I'd spent so much time working on the bread, and it was ruined. I could have been more attentive to the time, but I feel really upset that she didn't think to let me know when she didn't see me respond or come downstairs. She said she didn't want to disturb me....Am I the asshole here?

Edit: I think it's important to note that this person isn't someone I just live with. We are supposedly friends. I listen to her problems, she listens to mine. I go out of my way to make sure she's alright and vice versa. It's very copacetic. The fact that she turned off the timer and didn't tell me *when she knows I am not a texter, don't keep my phone on me* felt *intentional* and hurtful to have ignored the timer and acted like it was my fault. If it was just any other old day when I was baking bread and I lived with someone I didn't know well, it would be one thing. But, that is not our relationship. She always talks about how close we are. In this scenario, this was tantamount to aggression. Men may not understand. Women will get it better because ladies do this sort of thing, unfortunately. I feel totally gaslighted.

Update: I did apologize, and she did too. We're alright. Thanks to all of you who responded in a thoughtful way to help me understand the other side. ",2017-02-09 22:37:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/5t3ed8/aita_for_being_mad_my_roommate_for_not_telling_me/,69,34,0.76,0

55,ESH,AITA For my frustration at my smoker girlfriend who stops me smoking (rather long context),"Ok so quite alot of context is needed for this. My girlfriends one of them typical young age smokers (been smoking since she was 14) so already there is that hypocrisy thing going on. (Im 19, shes 18). Now i do understand she cares for me alot. Like so much its almost annoying haha. But this is the thing. Now i struggle with mental health and have done since the age of 12, Ive had my suicidal times and on top of that i find it extremely hard to contain my anger. When my head gets bad, which is often i become a completely different person. I get extremely snappy and say things in anger and even (NEVER TO MY GIRLFRIEND I MUST STRESS, ID NEVER LAY A HAND ON HER) become prone to fighting. Yes, my girlfriend helps however not often enough. Which is purly because of my mental health. 

Now during a show at college of which i had lead part, i played a boy called William in a show called ""punk rock"" (look it up its a great play) which deals with mental health and during which i had like a mini mental breakdown and since then (been a year now) i havnt been able to get back on stage or even continue my college course. Back to my anger, i have much to be angry about. I had a reject alcoholic father, an alcoholic mother who failed in almost every way to be a parent. I got a way out into two family friends whom i thought to be loving.  If i piss em off even just a little (which is never intentional and often im innocent but thats an entirely different story) i get death threats and all that. My own mental health which i struggle with in so many fucking ways. A college tutor who understands nothing. And literally so much more but if i was to type it, itd lose the point of the post and it just isnt relevant. Point is i have much to be angry about. 

So far then, i struggle with mental health. I have gone from a shitty parent to even shittier. I had a breakdown which continues to hold me back. And my girlfriend can only help so much. I realised cigarettes actually take all my anger out of me. This stops me completely fucking up my relationship. It also calms my head down considerably. 

Now, this is where it gets even more of a pisstake. She has no problem buying backy for her underage friends. Giving fags to people who dont smoke (twice) and even when in in absolute tears, and hurting so much shell only reluctantly allow me a single toke. Which of course does nothing. A few times ive smoked and she found out and it nearly ended my relationship. I could be suicidal and still not allowed one which i know would help. 

Doesnt end here. I have finally managed to compromise for a vape. Althought nowhere near as helpful im greatfull its something. However she treats it like its ""ours"" (its not, was given by a friend for me for my head. She has fags) and she can again, use it whenever she wants. I cant. If i do she gets once again, very shitty. 

So am i the asshole for getting extremely frustrated because i cant have a fag to help me calm down no matter how bad i am (shes even seen me in absolute tears till she reluctanlty gave in and wasnt happy about it) but she can give fags to underage friends who she also cares about, and fags to people that dont smoke?

Edit: Sorry quite important. Ive never smoked before. I just found out it helps

56,ESH,AITA for telling my friend's girlfriend about his true intentions with their relationship?,"This will be a longer one.

Myself, best friend and his girlfriend moved into an apartment together for college a few years ago and had been living together up until the end of this spring semester. My friend and I have know each other since elementary school and have been good friends since middle school.  We get along super well and have a lot in common especially sense of humor. (Immagine a milder version of the scrubs bromance between J.D. and Turk.) This is sort of embarrassing to say but he was really my only friend. I had acquaintances from class that I would hang out with and work out with from time to time, but no one that I was really close with. Apart from having a pretty big ego and some insecurities of which I have only just realized this past semester, we got along really well.  I also knew that had a fairly regular habit of lying and manipulating. (Mostly parents, acquaintances and his girlfriend although I was never aware of anything too awful in regards to his girlfriend until more recently.) I was passive and ignored these habits for years because we got along so well otherwise and I was never friends with, or close to anyone that he would lie to and manipulate.  Fast forward to the beginning of this spring semester.  

I started to become friends with his girlfriend as I didn't have anyone around the apartment to talk to during most of the day.  He was not around our apartment very much due to working 30 hours a week and a heavier class schedule. She and I would mostly watch netflix.  We were eventually good enough friends that we went to a bar together to meet one of her single friends and possibly set me up with her. It didn't end up working out as her single friend was extremely drunk, which I don't find very attractive, especially for a first impression.

Later in the semester he started to tell me about a girl that he was working with at his job.  He said that he wished that he was single so that he could date her instead or get his current girlfriend to agree to an open relationship so that he could see if he liked his coworker better that his girlfriend. He said that he likes his girlfriend but doesn't see himself staying with her for the long haul. He said that he promised himself when they first started dating if someone better came along he would break up with her for the new person.  I know his girlfriend well and an open relationship would be completely out of the question. Whenever he would talk about conversations that he had with other girls she would regularly comment ""Do I have to fight this bitch?"". She clearly expressed that she would not be into anything other than a committed relationship.

He decided that he would gradually be more and more shitty to her until she decided to break up with him. He wanted to go this route rather than telling her outright that he wanted to break up.  At first I was ok with this. I was much better friends with him than I was with her. I also figured that she would break up with him relatively quickly based on the way that he was treating her.  (noting physical, only verbal and body language.)  This kept going on for months and I started to feel bad for her.  I told him that the whole situation was bothering me and that he should do something about it. (implying that I wanted him to either stop treating her like shit or break up with her.  He ignored me and continued his previous behavior. She had been nice to me and I was just standing by watching and keeping his secret. 

 Throughout this time he was constantly texting and snapchatting his co worker.  At first he would lie to her about who he was texting and then later on he would tell the truth about who he was texting but not about the nature of their conversations. I never saw the conversations between him and his co worker, however I could tell that  they were flirty.  I know that his girlfriend would not be ok with constant regular text conversations with other girls let alone that they were flirty.  

After I started to feel bad for her I also started to develop a crush on her.  I don't think that she had any of the same feelings, and in the back of my head I knew that we weren't completely compatible but nonetheless that's how I felt.  As the situation progressed I decided to tell him that I would be interested in dating her if they broke up, but that I wouldn't pursue her if it would make things weird between us after they were broken up.  Bro's before hoe's type stuff...etc.  He immediately replied to my text. Paraphrasing ""Nah man I think she and I will be fine. I'm just being an asshole because I'm depressed since my grandpa died."" He continued saying that ""he didn't think that it would be weird if I dated her if they ever broke up.""  I replied with something like ""It's cool. No problem bruh"". I was highly skeptical of his excuse for being shitty to his girlfriend based on the fact that he had such an interest in his co worker and would regularly ask his dog if he ""wanted a new mommy"" while he and I were hanging out at the apartment.  In addition, both of our grandparents had recently passed away a few months ago.  I had grieved enough and had gotten passed it.  I thought that he had done the same as he hadn't mentioned his grandfather in quite a long time and seemed to be just as happy as he had been before.  I really didn't care if he was lying or not. The bottom line was that he said that he thinks they will be fine.  I have never had any intention of stealing my best friend's girlfriend. 


When I got home from class we picked up our normal conversations and started our usual joking around like normal.  For the next month or so his behavior took a complete 360 degree turn from being super shitty to being much more polite, doing his share of the chores, and even getting her donuts in the morning.  I still liked her but was completely content with just being friends with her. I just wanted my best friend to be happy, and I was relieved that for the time being I was no longer in the middle holding on to the knowledge of his true intentions.  

Everything was just like normal until after I went to the bar with her to meet her single friend like I had mentioned earlier.  The next morning she was extremely rude and short with me. I just ignored it and chalked it up to her being in a bad mood. This behavior continued for another week.  I had no idea why she was acting like this.  I gradually become more resentful of her actions as I could see no cause for them and our friendship severely dwindled.  We would barely acknowledge each other throughout the day, however I never returned her rude behavior.

Eventually he returned to being shitty, lying to her and manipulating her while being emotionally invested in his co worker. He was constantly texting and snapping her like before. He essentially returned to all his previous shitty behavior trying again to get her to break up with him.  This time I couldn't care less how he treated her. I felt like she had stomped all over our friendship for no discernible reason.  I let things get ever worse this time.  

One night all 3 of us were getting pretty drunk and watching tv together.  He texted me from across the couch that one of the more disliked characters in the tv show that we were watching was metaphorically speaking [insert girlfriend's name]. I Replied ""Hahaha R.I.P. [insert girlfriend's name]"" followed by a couple gifs of people laughing.  He replied ""lol she'll be fine.""  

This was a major turning point, not only for the story but also for me as a person. I regretted what I texted him the previous night and felt like a completely horrible human being (as I should have).  It made me rethink what kind of person I wanted to be as well as take a long look in the mirror as to who I was going to become if I continued this type of behavior. I though about the notion that your personality is an average of the people you spend the most time with.  I realized that my best friend was an extremely poor influence on my character.  Years ago I would have never let things get this bad.  Possibly worst of all I thought to myself, If he will do this to the girl that he supposedly loves, what would he do to his best friend in the future?

A few weeks went by and I observed as my friend continued to be completely shitty to her.  He would lie and manipulate her in front of me, and then brag about how good he was at it later on.  I was too much of a pussy to tell him that what he was doing was bothering me so much, especially after what I had texted him the night that we were all drunk.  It got bad enough one night that he told me that she had asked him in private if he was trying to break up with her to which he replied ""I don't know"".  During that conversation he said that he manipulated her by telling her it was all his fault and that his behavior didn't have anything to do with her.  He said that their conversation ended with her in tears saying that she wasn't going to give up on him and wanted to make it work.  He told me that his reaction to this (he only shared this with me) was ""Fuuuuuuuuck seriously...""  He said that he thinks the only reason that he wants to stay with her is so that he won't be alone. Knowing all of this information caused me to start grinding my teeth at night. It was also starting to affect my schoolwork.  The next few days I watched her putting in extra effort to their relationship to be helpful and thoughtful.  

I couldn't stand to watch him lie and manipulate her and get away with it.
One day I finally got up the courage to tell her the truth in the form of a letter that I sent her as a pdf file in text message.  I couldn't bear to tell her in person, and I know that I would have started crying and not articulated it very well. I decided that it was in the best interest of my character to cut my best friend out of my life and move on to make better friends.  I never asked or expected her to keep the information that I shared with her from my him, however in her reply she thanked me multiple times and told me that she wouldn't throw me under the bus. I met with her and her mom at lunch a few days later to discuss the rent situation as she would need his and my signatures in order to exit our lease. She said that it wasn't fair to me to have to pay half the rent instead of one third since she was leaving him immediately. Her mom said that she would continue to pay her part of the rent until our lease was up at the end of the semester. This ended up being unnecessary as his parents offered to pay for it instead.  

She said that she would wait to tell him until i moved out at the end of the semester to transfer to a different school, and she did. Fast forward to a few days ago. I got 2 text messages from him.  (Paraphrased) ""You betrayed me for a crush that you had on my ex.""  ""I should have kicked you out when you told me that you would be interested in dating her if we ever broke up.  I was depressed as fuck and needed help, and then you fucking move away. Don't ever talk to me again.""

These 2 texts are the reason that I am writing this extremely way too long post.
His reasoning for why I told her about everything caught me off guard.  ""You betrayed me for a crush that you had on my ex.""  Up until now the reason that I told her the truth was always that I didn't like the influence that I felt he had on my character as well as the the direction that my character would continue to go if I stayed friends with him. I also couldn't bear to watch him get away with lying and manipulating people anymore. Would he do the same thing to his best friend, and do I want to live with the constant worry that he is lying to me.  I never realized how much lying to people could hurt them until I saw it happen first hand to someone that I cared about.

I think that there is a part of me that was jealous and resentful of him for her loving him even though he constantly lied to and manipulated her.  Even though he was a complete asshole for treating her like this, am I still at fault for telling his girlfriend about everything that he has done without making more of an effort to express my discontent with his actions?

TLDR: Am I at fault for not making more of an effort to express how my best friend's actions towards his girlfriend were wrong before telling her the truth about his intentions.

57,YTA,AITA for getting angry around my gf for no reason?,"Firstly and most important, I never yell at her, verbally abuse or anything like that.

Thing is, I get annoyed and angry sometimes. Out of the blue. Like once or twice every week. I just need 20 minutes alone and I'm good. I have some mental issues, as does she. In fact, we first met on an online chat for helping with depression, anxiety, panic and other stuff like that. I actually managed to cut way down my drinking in the period we've been together, meaning I no longer drink by myself.

So we were talking on the phone, and she had this hysterical laughing fit while texting one of her friends. She wouldn't shut the fuck up, she was laughing maniacally for like 5 minutes! I was pretty anxious already, and it started to make my chest physically hurt.

I rudely interrupted her laughter, and asked her if I could call her back in an hour or so, this time with a dead serious and angry tone. Too bad, she didn't answer my calls anymore. Won't text me back. We are logged on a private chat 24/7 for just the two of us, in case we can't communicate via phone, and she logged off. It's been 2 days and no contact.

My anxiety is sky high right now. Today, June 12th, is ""Valentine's Day"" where I live, for fucks sake. I feel like a piece of shit.





Edit: update: she called me. We're okay now. :) I'm going to see a shrink with my brother and mom this week. We're all messed up. Hope it helps me. Don't want to lose her.

58,YTA,AITA for continuing to argue when someone backpedals,"I'm pretty sure I'm an asshole when I do this, so I'm more asking for help understanding why it's an asshole thing to do and what I should do instead.  I don't exactly have great social skills, so please help me. While I don't really get in major arguments that often with people, I do get into somewhat trivial arguments with my close friends and family at least once a month, and a common aspect of those arguments is that I'll continue to argue if they backpedal, unless they also give a good apology.  I'll give a specific example that happened a couple days ago. I'll do my best to be as accurate as possible, but I don't think the quotes that I'll give are 100% verbatim. I think they're close, though.

My boyfriend and I, who both play a lot of video games, were talking about video games over the phone. We talked about Dragon Age: Inquisition, and I had mistakenly thought that my boyfriend had played it before, and he corrected me, telling me that he played it for only an hour before stopping. He likes the series, but he didn't like Dragon Age II much, which discouraged him from continuing the series. I like the entire series quite a lot.

After that, we moved on to talking about Xenoblade Chronicles, which is one of his favorite games, and I'm looking forward to playing it someday. He talked for a while about everything that he loves about it, and at one point, he said, ""Oh yeah, the reason that I stopped playing Inquisition is because Xenoblade Chronicles does it better."" It wasn't clear what ""it"" was, but I think he was referring to the sidequest system and the gameplay.  I don't know much about Xenoblade Chronicles, so I don't really have an opinion on that, but I actually don't especially like the gameplay in Inquisition either.

Based on his tone and his words, I found what he said to be a bit dismissive about a game that I really like, and while I tried to let it go at first, I ultimately decided to tell him that that was a rude thing to say about a game that I like, and I went on to say that that is a foolish reason to not give a game more of a chance, especially when that game was pretty well-received and many of his friends like the game. While I tried to say that calmly, I'm sure I sounded a bit irritated.

He, also sounding irritated, responded that it wasn't dismissive or rude because he also likes Dragon Age (the first game, anyway) and he intends on playing Inquisition someday, too. He also said that he was praising Xenoblade Chronicles and not insulting Inquisition. 

This is the part where I think I was an asshole. I told him that he was insulting Inquisition because of the way he phrased it and because he gave it as a reason for why he stopped playing after an hour.  We then got into an argument about what he originally said, and after a minute or so, when it was clear that this wasn't going to be resolved with a ""Sorry, I was rude,"" I said, ""I'm willing to drop this, if you want. I don't think there's any point in continuing to argue about this."" He was very quiet for a minute, and when I asked if he was okay, he said, in a forced calm voice, that he was sorry for being rude and dismissive and that he didn't want to talk any more tonight. ""Good night.""

To be honest, I actually wasn't that upset about the conversation anymore and more worried about him, which is why I decided to ask about my behavior on here.  We have since apologized to each other, and he even sent me a gift on Steam (because of the Summer Sale) to apologize, though I actually feel uncomfortable when I receive apology gifts, especially when I consider myself to also be at fault.  I thanked him for it, though, of course.

So, in those types of arguments, where I argue with someone when they backpedal and they try to say that they didn't say/mean to say that when I believe they did say/mean to say that, am I an asshole? I think I was, at least a little bit, because what if he was telling the truth? I think for him, regardless of what he actually said, it probably was the truth.  On the other hand, I've backpedaled before, and I remember a few times in high school where I tried to lie and pretend that I didn't say what I know I said.  Either way, assuming that I know someone's thoughts is rude, too, right?

What would a kind person do, in my shoes? Accept their not-apology? Explain my point-of-view, let them tell me theirs, and drop it? Don't bring it up in the first place? 

TL;DR: Am I an asshole for arguing when someone tries to take back what they say? Specific example: Boyfriend and I got into an argument about video games. He said something dismissive about a game that I really like. I said that what he said was rude. He said he didn't mean to insult the game. I said he did mean to insult the game. Am I the asshole in that situation for not dropping the argument after he said that he didn't mean to insult the game?

Edit: Typos.

Edit: Thanks for your replies and your verdicts, everyone. And an even bigger thank you to those who went out of their way to explain their perspective. I apologized to my boyfriend again, and he took it very well and doesn't seem to hold any negative feelings regarding our argument. As for my question about arguing when someone qualifies or takes back what they said, the consensus is not to do it when it's a trivial argument, I think? And also to believe the person when they're qualifying what they're saying. I'll try to do that. I probably won't respond anymore because I need to focus on other stuff and I'm not sure that anything new will be said.",2017-07-06 19:02:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/6lnzc3/aita_for_continuing_to_argue_when_someone/,36,30,0.92,0
59,YTA,AITA for rigging a raffle at work?,"I'm a supervisor at my job with a very strong union. Because of this we have attendance issues with many employees so to help with this, we have raffles on days that have historically low attendance such as the day before or after a holiday. We give everyone who came to work on time a ticket and our safety supervisor will draw 1 to determine he winner. This particular days prize was a bike with the company logo on it. Well I happened to walk in when she was drawing (she does it kind of privately) and I saw who the winner was. Well this particular gentleman has horrible attendance. Don't get me wrong, he is someone I would consider a friend so it's not like I have a grudge or anything but there are plenty of other hard working employees who deserve it more. So I told her that and I said don't pick him just pick someone else. So we had a little talk about who to pick and I couldn't think of anyone so I just redrew from the box and the next person was actually a great employee who didn't have a car and walked to work everyday. 

So my question is AITA here? I feel like I did the right thing and put the bike in the hands of someone who actually needed it and deserved it but I had to do it in a sneaky slimey way. 

Edit: Thanks for all the replies. I'm officially acknowledging I'm an asshole for this. However I'm not sorry for what I did and I know the person who got the bike is very grateful.

60,YTA,AITA for accidentally selling a guitar amp,"We've been storing my GF's sister's Guitar and Amp and a few other knickknacks for a few months now, because GF's sis doesn't have space for it. My GF hates clutter and finally convinces her sis to sell stuff off. She sells what I think are the Guitar and Amp on craigslist but when the guy wants to come over she was already planning on going to the gym. So she asks me to come home early from work and meet up with the guy. It's a rush to get home, but all in all, no biggie. I give the guy the Guitar and Amp. He gives me the money, I think everything is great.

GF comes home and I tell her and immediately she's pissed at me. Apparently, she only sold the Guitar and not the Amp. The Amp had sentimental value for her sister and sis wanted to keep it. I get mad at her back for blaming me. I point out that they were sitting together in the closet and that they clearly looked like a set. GF had been wanting to clear out this closet and these were the last remaining things. Also, her sis lives across the country, had no plans to come get it, and what were we going to do with just an Amp? 

So I don't think it's my fault here, but as I'm typing this from the guest room aka doghouse it doesn't really feel that way. What do you guys think, reddit?

61,YTA,AITA for pointing out we are not close friends,"Alright, I'll preface this by saying I'm 99% sure I am the asshole here. We're both 21, i'm a guy, she's not if that makes any difference.

**Some light background reading:**

I have feelings for her, and she knows it. Her constant saying 'mate', and 'friend' feels a lot like she's just trying to rub it in that she doesn't like me that way. 

**The cracking story** 

I was talking to my friend, she said 'as a close friend you should know my every move' (as a joke, she's not a lunatic). I was a bit taken aback, so I said 'ok step back on close friend' and then continued on as normal. Didn't really think it'd be a big deal tbh. 

She was having none of that, said ""Oh so we're not close friends. Fine, ok"". So I explained why I thought this (below), and then she just said 'retracted', and 'i hope you're happy' (I mean obviously I'm not considering I'm a complete fucking loser and barely have any friends, which she basically knows). 

My reasoning to her was that I'm not in her top 50 friends so saying i'm a 'close friend' is an incredibly liberal use of the phrase, and I just don't agree with that. 

**Vague conclusion**

I'm pretty sure I am the asshole, but I'm not sure why to be honest, so could someone explain that to me. 

**Further**

I may have missed some VITAL piece of information, so let me know if there's any more you need to know.


Thanks,

62,YTA,AITA wanting mutual consideration?,"A lady friend I've known for over a year accompanied me to vacation resort (my treat) in June. She also agreed to accompany me on a road-trip to Montana in September. It had been 6 weeks since our last conversation (we're 900 miles apart) and when I sent a text a few days ago reminding her, she acted surprised to hear from me. She said she was working and will call me at 7:30p when she gets home. At 7:30 no call, 8:30 no call and I sent a text saying I'll call. No response, so at 9:30 I call a full voice-mail box. I didn't want to assume she was flaking on me so the next day (18 hours later) I sent a text wishing her luck with the emotional issue preventing her from calling me. 16 hours later, still no call but a text telling me I was judgmental because her cousin needed her more than calling me to ""catch up"". She also tells me everyone comes to her with their problems and she should charge for being a shrink. This is now two days after she said she would call me. I text her that there was nothing judgmental and I just wanted her to be considerate about keeping her word. I also told her if she's too busy, maybe we shouldn't remain friends. BOOM! She says I'm being a judgmental asshole to the only person willing to keep a decent relationship with me, and she was helping her cousin out with a problem so I can cram it up my ass! Huh?!

63,YTA,AITA for syruping a poorly parked car,"For backstory, my apartment cannot handle its capacity. Internet, hot water, parking, you name it, when the apartment fills up, nobody gets enough of any of those. Parking is an especially big issue for me, since even though the apartment has a nice garage, they sold more parking passes than they have spaces. They also have a visitor lot, which tows aggressively if you don't pay. Needless to say, it's very important to me that I can get a parking space.

Well one night, this wasn't an option. It was 3am, I had just driven back and wanted to go the fuck to sleep. Circled the garage, all 3 and a half floors, completely occupied. But one occupant stood out above the rest. A nice silver generic sedan in two whole spaces. 

Now there's no way for me to get in contact with the owner, nobody gets their own assigned space, and since I wasn't gonna call a tow truck at 3am just to avoid paying for a few hours of parking, I did what any other disgruntled prick would do.

I parked my car in the visitor lot, paid, went home, grabbed a full bottle of maple syrup, went back to the garage, and went to town. It wasn't the whole car, mostly the door handles to make their hands sticky for the whole drive, and the windshield wipers, just so it'd take extra long for their windshield to clean up, but boy was it satisfying. To this day, there are still dark spots on the concrete where my art was previously parked.

I told him about it and almost broke up with him over it. He acted like he didn't know what happened. I told him and he said ""what? In no way were we flirting we were just talking"". They both claim there wasn't flirting but they talked and laughed for like 3 hours together right in front of me.

65,YTA,AITA for saying I don't want to take responsibility for my exe's inability to effectively communicate?,"First let me say, I AM an asshole for a lot of stuff I did during the relationship. I was emotionally abusive  and didn't respect her space after the relationship. I have a lot of guilt to process and am now seeing a therapist (and soon a psychiatrist for other deep seeded issues).

Part of processing this crippling guilt for me has been trying to be realistic and practical about it. Mitigating it to what truly is my fault and not just taking the blame for EVERYTHING. Which is what I was originally doing. 

I was talking to my friend about this guilt. I was saying, I take responsibility for being emotionally abusive and not respecting my ex's space. I also said I DON'T have to take responsibility for her poor communication skills. 

My ex didn't effectively break up with me. I had to basically do the breakup because she couldn't just come out and say it. She spent two months distancing herself and not telling me what was wrong. It was hell for me and I can honestly say I have trauma from it. Also we were in an open relationship and she ommited that she had slept with someone else (something we had agreed to be truthful on). When we broke up she said a lot to make me think we could still have a future: ""things might work out"" etc.

Basically I was telling my friend that I don't have to take responsibility for those things. They damaged my self esteem and made moving on harder for me. I'm not going to feel guilty for her inability to communicate. 

My friend got mad at me, saying I should have known. She says my ex was afraid of how I would react. And I get that honestly. It makes sense. But it doesn't make leading me on right or less hurtful. And I certainly don't have to take responsibility for it. Relationships are a two way street and my ex CHOSE to stay with me (in fact she cried for us to stay together when we went long distance). I wasn't physically abusive, manipulative. I was just an asshole occasionally when I'd have a bad day. There was no ""if you leave"" type of threat. 

So as awful as I feel and despite all of this guilt I have to remember that I didn't force her to be with me. She wanted the relationship too. 

Am I the asshole?

66,YTA,AITA for getting upset with my girlfriend for hanging out with this guy,"Backstory: 3 years dating. Best friend type of relationship.  

So my gf recently started college. She is in an organization that had a bunch of other freshmen in it as well. So she's in this friend group of people, several girls and guys, who hang out, study, eat lunch, and do homework together. There's one dude in the group who has been subtly flirting with her (the guy is in a one year long relationship).  

Anyways, a few weeks into the semester, he invited her to his dorm to ""work on homework"" together that he was having trouble with. She didn't go obviously. They talk every once and a while, as friends do, but he invited her over a lot. He invited her over to watch a tv show earlier this week and it started an argument between us. He texted her this morning asking to go shopping with him to help pick out his gf an anniversary present, I told her it was ok to go if she had some other people tag along.   

So, she ended up going with another guy and girl as well. They all hung out a bit after and all went to his dorm to hang out. Once I found out she was there, I got upset with her for not telling me. I already didn't trust this guy and het going over there for a bit upset me. We argued for a bit and she told me she wouldn't talk to him anymore if I wanted that.

67,YTA,AITA for being aroused by my wife every time I'm around her.,"I was at work having a private convo with a couple other married guys and we're discussing how our wives can misinterpret our attentions. I respectfully comment about how when we are cuddling or laying in bed or watching netflix, i usually press for sex. Been married 7 years, have sex a lot. Its fun, we both enjoy ourselves (i make sure we both have a good time/orgasm), but she does comment that sometimes she wishes we would just cuddle and not go any further because that pushes her away from wanting to cuddle in the future unless she really wants to go all the way... anyways, as I'm stating that this should be seen as a huge compliment that i still find her attractive to want to have sex anytime I'm around her (because she has image problems, like i'd assume most women do after a child and gaining a ton of weight they don't want), this gal we work with comes over, says she overheard me, puts me on blast for treating my wife like a sex slave and that i'm a misogynist and that i don't treat my wife with respect... etc etc. I don't give two shits what this woman thinks, she doesn't effect my work atmosphere, so, thanks for your opinion. What i do care about is if she is right and i don't respect my wife as much as i can. Obviously more cuddles and such without the expectation of sex may be better, i just thought showing my wife how awesome she looks/is means more. Or something... Am i an asshole or just need to treat my wife differently/better? 

Edit: I spoke to my wife about this and the recommendations of Sarahmgray (thank you so much) and after a 3.5 hour conversation, really realized that, like many of you said, she feels more loved by being cuddled, having the candid conversations, such as what we were currently having, and the enjoyment of each others company.  Like I said eariler, I never push her to do anything she doesn't want to do, but out of the 4/5 times a week, she said that probably only 3 were what she really wanted to do, and the other times were for me, which she was happy to meet me there, but if I pulled back to a few times a week, and spent the other 2/3 times just cuddling on the couch or having conversation that didn't lead into sex, that would mean more than having sex.  So.  Look like I'm getting less sex, but building a significantly stronger relationship with my wife, which is a GREAT trade off :)  Thank you all for the opinions.  Never would have really realized to the extent that it was.  She has said some things, but it was never pushed because she felt it was unloving of her to push me away, which made me feel awful.

I'm in line getting ready to buy some chewing tobacco. Now I know chewing tobacco is horrible for me, but some days I just need the little escape. 

Behind me is what can best be described as someone fitting the [Can I Speak to the Manager](https://i.imgur.com/D8Ftqal.jpg) profile. As I tell the cashier what I want, this lady loudly interjects in a condescending tone:
>There's no reason you should be buying that crap.  I have a friend who was addicted to that stuff and got mouth cancer.  It's moronic to keep buying something that will kill you.

I replied

>It's no worse than being obese from an eating addiction, but I'm not preaching to you to put back the junk food.

Her response, and hence the post was

>Asshole.

70,YTA,AITA for wanting a bathroom to myself?,"Tl;dr in the bolded lines

**So I moved into a big, old house a couple of months ago with two older dudes that I had never met before.** They're both from India, I'm from elsewhere in the U.S.. We're all on good terms, but not particularly close. We usually say hi to each other in passing, sometimes I give them rides to the grocery store. We're all graduate students at the nearby university, and rented rooms through a property company that owns houses in the area. It was one of the cheapest housing options , and for good reason – the house is pretty shitty. 

Even though there are a total of six bedrooms, **there are only two bathrooms – one on each floor**. They're pretty small as far as bathrooms go. **The two roommates got here a couple of months before me, and both took rooms upstairs. I took a room downstairs.** The bathroom was totally empty, so I quickly started filling it with my toiletries and towels. At the time, we weren't sure if there was going to be another person moving into the house, so I tried to take up minimal space in the cabinet and the small sink counter, in case I was going to have to share. Ultimately, we didn't get a 4th roommate, so I let my stuff expand. 

**We never actually had ""the conversation"" about bathrooms.** I kind of figured that it just sort of made sense that they would use the one upstairs and I would use the one downstairs. Presumably guests would also use mine. **I know it's not fair that they would have to share while I get one more or less all to myself, but I figured I lucked out with the arrangement.**

**Except, I've noticed in the last couple of months that I don't have it all to myself. My roommates frequently use my bathroom.** Sometimes just for a quick piss, sometimes for long shits >= 20 minutes, sometimes for the shower. One time in the morning when I was late for class, I went to use it and it was locked. I knocked on the door and no one answered. I asked ""Hello?"" and got nothing. I knocked again, and got a dazed reply of ""yeah?"". I guess he... fell asleep in there? They seem to wash their hands about half the time. When one of my roommates was sick, I noticed occasional phlegm piles in the sink and shower floor. Other than that, they leave it generally clean. And hell, I don't leave it particularly clean.

Clearly the best scenario would be to have a big open discussion about it, but none of us are big discussers, and I'd rather not bring it up if I'm not in the right. **Is it assholish of me to expect that I should get the bathroom to myself?**

Edit: Sounds like I'm the asshole! Fair, I have no right to think of it as my personal facility. ",2017-11-03 14:35:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/7ajrml/aita_for_wanting_a_bathroom_to_myself/,10,40,0.95,0
71,YTA,WIBTA if I ended a friendship because I didn't like the other people my friend was hanging out with?,"Recently I have gotten back in touch with one of my friends, and in that time she has made a lot of new friends, though she claims that I'm still her best friend. That being said, she and I don't have as much time together now, since we're both much busier, and I'm well aware that she spends far more time with these friends than me. I've already mentioned to her that, while I don't like most of these friends and don't want to be included in their group, that she is completely free to remain friends with them and I don't want to get in their way whatsoever. 
Still, she's been trying to make me interact with them instead of just letting it be, in an attempt to make me become friends with her group. Though it seems to me that she has a very close group of friends, she still makes me feel guilty about a fight in the past, and how she couldn't survive without me.

72,YTA,AITA for making a joke referencing black people leaving stickers on hats,"On Halloween we were going out on a haunted city tour, and it was cold, so I grabbed the first hat from the closet.


The hat still had the sticker on it, because I had not work it yet before.
I had recently watched the ""Key and Peele - Dueling hats"" video.

so on the wy up there, I said: ""Do I need to take the sticker off this hat, or can I go as a black guy for Halloween"".

My girlfriend started arguing that I was being incredibly racist, and she didn't even know who I was anymore.

I asked her to tell me what specifically about the joke was racist, since I thought it was just making a comment on a cultural concept, not mocking or denigrating it.

73,YTA,AITA for finding humor in controversial topics?,"My best friend and I tend to share opinions on most controversial/hot button/political topics. We have recently come into conflict on how we approach our opinions though. 

My friend is very passionate about topics like these, and reads up on them frequently. If she gets started, she can talk for hours about these topics, and she is very quick to stand up for what she thinks is right.

I, on the other hand, am a lot more lax on these kind of things. My style of jokes tend to involve a lot of sarcasm, satire, and black humor. It's what I grew up with. I rarely read up on many of the current headlines as I'm not interested in politics, and I'm more involved in issues that are closer to myself. 

More and more recently, my friend has been calling me out on my humor, following up with many lectures as to why what I said was wrong or offensive. I was beginning to feel attacked, so I decided to address the situation. 

I explained to her that when she calls me out like that, it makes me feel like I'm a terrible person for having those views, and that it was hurtful, and I suggested that we try to avoid these types of topics in future conversations in order to not put any more strain on our friendship. We do get along real well otherwise. 
I admit some of my wording may have not been the best as I described to her what I meant, suggesting that she was oversensitive and obsessed with making things PC. 

Her reply was to tell me that if I felt like a bad person because of my views, that I could change. She then went on to point out some of the things I've said in the past that have hurt her. She then called me selfish and bigoted (the latter an insult that has really been bothering me.).

Nothing was concluded from our conversation, and she ended it telling me that she was glad we had this talk. 

The few times I have seen her since this specific conversation, she has acted like nothing has happened. I personally feel reluctant to continue our friendship. 

Am I the asshole?

74,YTA,AITA for having disputes with my ex about changing her appearance?,"So there’s a bit of a backstory required here.

My (now ex) girlfriend and I decided to break up about 3 months ago due to distance and diverging trajectories. (She’s South African, going from strength to strength teaching at high school in Cape Town, while I’m from the UK, here in Europe trying to figure out wtf to do with my life while teaching English abroad). 

We spent over a year together, and for 6 months I was living with her in Cape Town. We generally got on great, but, as is normal, would occasionally have a difference of opinion and, quite rarely, a confrontation. 

I’m really quite introverted, and hate conflict, while she is an out and out extrovert and enjoys discussing ideas openly. She would tell me, or anyone else, if she didn’t agree with something or saw injustice. (She’s also a bona fide feminist, which is important). Sometimes I admired her for this, but sometimes I resented her and saw it as misguided moral crusading. (e.g. Pulling me up for calling a cigarette a ‘fag’. I’m from the UK, that’s my lingo ffs.)

Aaaanyway, one of our biggest disputes was when she wanted to change her hairstyle. She liked changing her look, had a few minor piercings, and was very into her appearance. (I am too, but I dress and look quite conservative, i.e. no tattoos, piercings. Edit: I once blurted out that I would have reconsidered dating her if she’d had a septum piercing when we met, after she told me she’d considered getting one. Tbh I think they’re horrible, and a banal fashion statement.) So one day she told me she wanted braids, and so we went to buy extensions.

On the way I started to feel weird about it, similar to when she suddenly decided she would get another piercing. When I asked her why she got irritated with me and asked ‘What’s with the interrogation??’ I don’t really know why, but I felt uncomfortable, sort of like there was some kind of power struggle brewing beneath the surface. I ultimately confessed that I liked her hair as it was (true) and didn’t know why she wanted to change it. She did have some kind of complex about her hair, as curly ‘african’ hair comes with a lot of baggage re identity, especially in SA. 

In the end, she didn’t change her hair and we didn’t talk much more about it. I felt weird and guilty for feeling so put out by what seemed something so trivial. I thought I was doing right by being honest. 

The reason her feminism is important is because I was always very aware that things like this could quickly become an ‘issue’. I was perfectly aware she could have seen me as a controlling arsehole putting limits on how she could look, and I was on her turf and vastly outnumbered by her friends and family. 

Fast forward to now. We’re still talking occasionally on whatsapp, post break up. Recently things have become a bit more fiery, and we’re arguing a lot more. So yesterday she sends me a photo of her with braids captioned ‘going out’. I say ‘oh new hair!’ She says ‘yeah, the hair you freaked out about 😂’. I just tell her I prefer it natural (still true; I just find braids can be a bit scraped and tacky). I’m not sure whether this is her getting over me or something, but my feelings haven’t changed since we were together.

Since then I’ve been inordinately annoyed. I feel weird and guilty, and I can’t get the whole thing out of my mind. It may seem trivial but it’s the implications of the dispute which are gnawing at me. Am I really a controlling arsehole? Are my ideas of dating old fashioned? Is it me who has to change? Why do I feel so strongly about it?? 

So, Reddit, please: am I the arsehole? 

(For what it’s worth I frequently told her she is beautiful, and she is. I don’t think she needs to change.)

Edit: Eh, thanks for providing your thoughts everyone, I suppose. I have been branded ‘asshole’ so the message is clear. (Though it sounds nicer than ‘arsehole’ so there’s that.)

For those who were wondering not much really was said at the time beyond me telling her I liked her hair as it was. My question was more about my internal reaction to the situation, and trying to figure out why I felt strangely about it. This only came up again after months when she messaged me last week. We haven’t spoken much since then.

Anyway, it’s been a humbling experience reddit. I’ve clearly got some attitude issues to work on. I hope we can still be friends 😬. ",2017-12-02 11:21:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/7h259v/aita_for_having_disputes_with_my_ex_about/,34,10,0.86,0
75,YTA,AITA for not reaching out/apologising to my friend?,"I will refer to my two friends as E and J. I apologise in advance as this is quite a long one.

 
First, a little backstory:

 
E, J and I have been friends for around 6 years. We were a trio up until E and J fell out about 6 months ago. The reason they fell out was a whole other drama in itself, but basically can be summarised as E being unhappy that J was ‘ditching us’ for a new boyfriend. In actuality, J had only asked to rearrange a girls night so she could see her boyfriend that night instead. The whole thing was blown out of proportion and as a result, E no longer wanted to speak to J, but I stayed friends with J because… well, why wouldn’t I? I know they had a big falling out over messenger in which some pretty harsh comments were thrown back and forth, but I made it clear to them both that I wasn’t going to take sides.

 
Fast forward to last Friday night. As I said, I’m still friends with both E and J even if they won’t talk. If I’m honest, I’ve always been closer with E and she lives in the same town as me, so I have spent more time with her in the 6 months since the trio broke up. However, it was J’s birthday last week which I wasn’t able to attend, so I invited her to my flat for a takeaway and drinks.

 
A little into the night, J told me her dad had died earlier in the week. J had a weird relationship with her dad; she was basically raised by her grandparents and rarely saw either of her parents, but he was still her dad so she had some very mixed emotions about it. We discussed it a little, but almost as quickly as J had brought it up, she changed the topic.

 
A short while later, I went to the bathroom and when I did, I sent E a message letting her know what had happened to J’s dad. E and J have had fallings out in the past, but part of what always brought them back together was when one reached out to the other after some emotional event that made them forget their falling out. I will admit at this point, I was being selfish in hoping I could get the two of them talking again. I also felt E ought to know, and that it might make her realise how insignificant their falling out was in the first place. *This is where I first evaluate my Asshole Status.* In retrospect, if J had wanted E to know about her dad, I’m sure she would have told her herself. I am an Emotional Drunk, but I can’t 100% use that as my excuse.

 
At first, E and I exchanged empathetic comments and she seemed 100% ready to forget about what had happened and reach out to J herself. However, at this point in the evening J and I made the decision to pick up some more alcohol so we left my flat. In the 20 minutes it took to go to the shop and back, I returned to a tirade of messages from E.

Here’s the message trail: https://imgur.com/gallery/mf7rt

 
At this point I confessed to J that I had told E about her dad. J asked to read over the messages, which she did. Her feelings were she had no interest in E reaching out to her and was annoyed that, in her words, E felt that I shouldn’t be hanging out with other people. J asked me not to give E her number. Frankly after the messages E sent me, I had no intention of giving her J’s number anyway. We continued to enjoy the rest of our night until J went home.

 
Mine and E’s conversation ends at my last two messages. Neither of us have said anything since Friday night. I’m conflicted, because I have a bad habit of taking 100% of the blame in situations like these and part of me wants to message her again with another, more in depth apology. At the same time, I feel E has blown this out of proportion just like she did to J 6 months ago, and I’m hurt by the comments she made about the two former friends who I no longer have any contact with (I haven’t for several years, so I feel like E was reaching to make that dig at me).

 
So, *am I the asshole*? Should I just suck it up and reach out to E, or am I right to feel she overreacted?

**EDIT: Thank you everyone for your comments. I seriously appreciated all of them, the “yes” and the “nos”.**

After considering everyone’s advice, I made the decision to send E and J two separate apologies.

I apologised (via messenger) to E for putting her in a shitty situation, and let her know I had passed her condolences on to J. I also said I couldn’t force her and J to be friends and I would be more mindful of that moving forward. No response yet. 🤞🏻

I apologised to J for telling E about her dad without her permission. To be honest we’d already discussed it on Friday night, but we were drunk and I wanted to send her something more sincere. She said she was surprised I brought it up again and that she was completely fine with the situation. So it seems like it’s only me still dwelling on the situation, ha.

76,YTA,AITA for using a shitty ex-roommate’s Hulu?,"I lived with this girl for five months in 2013. We will call her A. I thought she was my friend, but once I moved in she became toxic and basically started emotionally abusing me. If I wasn’t home when she got home from work, she would bombard me with calls and texts until I came home. She would break into my room and cry into my pillows when I wasn’t home. She would leave without notice for a week at a time, never arranging for someone to watch her dogs and cats (meaning I had to do it or the apartment would be destroyed). She lied about having cancer when she noticed me pulling away from her. She let her boyfriend move in without paying rent or utilities. She removed the pipes from the kitchen sink when we got into an argument. All the bills were in her name and I came home one day to all the utilities cut off, meaning none of the money I set aside for bills ever actually got used for bills. She began to hoard animals and acquired six snakes and three cats in the five months I lived with her. She threw tantrums if any of my things were in our shared spaces. I had to walk on eggshells 24/7 and moved out suddenly to escape her. 

During my time living with her she logged into Hulu on my Roku and never logged out. I still use her Hulu because a) I don’t want to pay for it and b) I see it as a harmless way to tell her to shove it without her ever knowing. I told a friend about this and they told me I was being an asshole.

77,YTA,AITA if I don't want to work physically with my father and uncle tomorrow instead of trying to find a different job?,"First time posting on this sub.

I'm 20M, and have been struggling to find a job ever since my summer job ended in August. I've put in applications, and no callbacks, nothing. Both sides of my family (parents are divorced) are getting mad at me, calling me lazy. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and I'll admit it's starting to get to me, but hopefully someone will offer me something soon. I seriously do want a job, even if it's only to get the complaining to stop.

Bit of background info. As mentioned, parents are divorced. Father was found to be doing some shady crap to screw my mother out of money (selling his landscaping/snow removal business to his brother (my uncle), acting like he's broke when he's obviously not, etc.) and refusing to help with college. And, I still hate him for it. Don't really like going over his house, or anything to do with him.

Fast-forward to tonight. Taking a shower, and my mother knocks and comes in, and suddenly tells me that tomorrow, I'm going to help my father and uncle shovel snow, and that she told him I'd be ready early in the morning, without even asking me first.

I told her no, I'm not helping them, that it's not because I don't want a *job*, it's because I don't want to help *them*, and that I'd go around tomorrow and put more applications in. 

I'm honestly trying to get something together, and people may think I'm lazy because there's something right in front of me and I refuse to take it...but it's a personal reason. I just don't want to help my father and uncle.

81,YTA,AITA for insisting that my girlfriend tell me something she’s been keeping from me?,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for about three years now (non-consecutive as we broke up for a while last year), and recently I was bored and went through her old twitter posts because I usually find things that sounded nerdy/dorky (we both do this) and I think it’s funny. One of her posts said “Do you ever feel like you fucked something up that was really good? Yeah me too.” It was posted a month after we had broken up so I was curious if it was about me. I asked her what it was she fucked up and she said it’s none of my business. 

We’re both usually extremely open and honest about everything so this really surprised me. So I said “If it’s about another guy or something I’m fine with that, I’m just curious what it was you felt like you fucked up.” Long story short we ended up doing this back and forth thing where she said it’s not a big deal and I would say if it’s not a big deal then why are you keeping it from me yadayadayada. Eventually she told me that she was thinking about dating another guy but decided not to. I told her okay thank you for telling me, it isn’t a big deal and it doesn’t bother me. 

Then the real shit show happened. She started calling me ridiculous and dramatic and that I should just trust that if she isn’t telling me then it’s not a big deal, and that anything that happened when we were broken up is none of my business and she’s not obligated to tell me. I responded by saying that she is someone I’m interested in marrying within the next couple years, and I can’t be comfortable making that decision if I feel like she’s keeping things from me, especially when I’m always open with her when asked about my past. I also said that she shouldn’t keep things from me or tell my things just because she is or isn’t obligated to do so. If she feels like she can’t be open with me about something that small, I feel like there’s bigger things she’s keeping from me and I don’t want to feel that way about someone I love and trust more than anyone. 

Was I being ridiculous/an asshole for pushing her to tell me something she didn’t want to tell me? Was I right to feel like she was being sketchy?

TL;DR: My girlfriend of three years was keeping a detail of her past (from when we were broken up) from me. I asked her to be open about it and she said it’s none of my business. Turned out it was about a guy, no big deal. She said I was ridiculous, I said she was acting sketchy and I felt like she wasn’t earning my trust.

During the incident, he said my Co curriculum activity was shit, and I replied that if they produce someone like you then they are also bad. Before that we had an oral test in front of class. He gave a thumbs down which I interpreted him as being salty as he didn’t do very well. Going back to my reply, then he said some profanities while I continued saying that is this what your parents taught you? Using parents as a tool to provoke him without swearing while he was screaming profanities profusely. Then there was this other guy who were friends with both of us and witnessed everything above, I whispered to him that he is probably salty about the test shit. Then he was so angry he took my water bottle and threw it against the plastic panel which broke (but not my water bottle) 

After that we had a talk with our teachers which resulted in us being friends again but then because I was held back for this even though I didn’t damage any property, my mother came down and had a talk with my form tutor. Finally it ended with her saying she wanted an email from the teacher following this incident  or if possible a phone call from the guys parents (he was known for having a horrible temper last year, being violent after provoked the slightest, it isn’t so bad now) however till now she hasn’t emailed at all.

The next day the teacher asked him to pay $60 but never message me to pay $30 which was half of the cost. We agreed to pay 50% each during The talk. Then my mother doesn’t give me the money because she needed the email to say like whatever. Throughout the teacher didn’t message me or email me about the cost at all, only messaging the other guy.  Now we are no longer friends because he shouted I need to change my bad habit which was discussed during our talk . I felt he was hypocritical as he was over exaggerating, another thing we talked about.

Now my friend is blaming me because I’m not paying for the window as the guy only paid half . I explained to him that it was because my mom didn’t allow and that there could be something else we didn’t know about and that’s the reason why the teacher didn’t say that I needed to pay. He said he wanted to go ask on my behalf but I told him not to because there could be a reason. Then now he’s angry and is giving me the cold shoulder. I feel that although it concerns you as it results in poor air flow, it is none of your business not to do anything at all about this. Another friend was also with him but after that he was okay and didn’t care much . That is the type of personality I respect as although he may feel I should have paid, he didn’t really care and continued to be friends. (Note that all the friends are different people) so am I the asshole for not paying for it ?

85,YTA,AITA for being annoyed that my in-laws only take my nephew to see “important” superhero movies?,"Everyone in this situation is you’re basic white suburban folks.

 I’ve been a big comic book fan forever and have seen every comic book movie to date in the theater, usually on opening weekend. My wife and I (we’re child free by choice) have a nephew (he’s 11 now) who was into superheroes as a really little kid. Especially Iron Man. But he had never seen a modern superhero movie outside of the first two X-Men movies, so that means no DCEU, and no MCU. 

But his parents, my in-laws, *have* since taken him to see Wonder Woman and Black Panther. But like, only those two. 

Now, I’m a big whiny rainbow flag waving libtard. I’m right there with the rest of the “libtards” and bleeding hearts cheering on more diverse leads in these movies. But I also think that my nephew’s parents are teaching him that diversity is more important than if a movie is something you actually like by doing things this way.

Like I said, I champion diversity, but I don’t think you should go see something just because of the diversity. Go see something because you like it. My wife is a hardcore feminist, but she didn’t want to see Wonder Woman because she just finds the DCEU characters mostly boring. She found Suicide Squad a bit more interesting because it wasn’t the same old boring Batman or Superman bullshit she’s seen a hundred times. But when other women, including her sister in law heard she hadn’t seen WW, they made her feel like a “bad feminist”. Can’t someone just not want to see a movie because it doesn’t look good to them, while still cheering that it got made and did well?

The thing that really bothers me is that I think my nephew would really enjoy the other Marvel movies. And it’s not like they haven’t taken him or shown them to him because the movies are too white or too male dominated. Its traditionally been because he’s been too young for them in their opinions, which is fine. But now it’s fine I guess? Well my personally mission is to get the caught up by Infinity War.",2018-03-11 05:26:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/83kv2o/aita_for_being_annoyed_that_my_inlaws_only_take/,53,37,0.74,0
86,YTA,AITA for telling someone with a mental disorder to butt out of my personal conversation,"There's this girl at my school who is a pretty huge outcast. She's pretty attractive, so it has nothing to do with her appearance and everything to do with her personality. 

She has the bad habit of interrupting other people's conversations if she hears something that catches her interest and then will just completely dominate the conversation by talking about facts no one cares about. She's really annoying and kind of weird.

Anyways, my friend and I were sitting in the back of the classroom and talking/joking around a bit and she walks up to us and just starts talking about something we had been discussing earlier. I have a cold and didn't really feel that well, so I was pretty annoyed already and told her it was ""an A and B conversation, so C your way out of it."". She didn't seem that hurt, but she went quiet and just kind of left.

Later after class, her ""friend"" pulled me aside and told me that I was an asshole because she has autism and I was being rude. I told her that I didn't know she had autism, but even if she did, then it was no excuse for her to be treated any differently than a normal person. 

So, am I the asshole for treating someone with autism the same way I would treat a normal person?",2018-03-15 23:26:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/84r10s/aita_for_telling_someone_with_a_mental_disorder/,14,14,0.85,0
87,YTA,AITA? Was my brother an asshole at the movie theatre?,"So a somewhat distant family member has been in the hospital with many issues, namely blood clots that have left her paralyzed for the rest of her life. For a period of time, we actually thought she might be close to death, and my brother had been getting updates periodically via text message.  One such text message came while we all happened to be at a movie.  He read the text message, passed the phone to my mom to show her, and she passed the phone to me to see it too.  Normally, I am very strict on myself about looking at my phone at the movie theatre, but given the circumstances, I quickly read the message, turned off the screen, and passed it back to my brother.

An older man who had been sitting behind us (and loudly whispering nonstop during the movie) approached us after the movie was over and said,  ""I'm glad you guys were able too check your messages in the middle of the movie.""  Now, part of me understands his point.. I, too, HATE it when people in front of me look at their phone, although I typically don't actually go out of my way to say anything to them.  So I get it, but I was still taken aback by him actually saying something.

My brother explained to him; ""I'm sorry, but we have a family member in the hospital, and that message was just to give us some new details.""  If I were the old man, I might have gotten embarrassed and said something like, ""Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that,"" and then left.  But the old man (who, mind you, was talking all throughout the movie) decided to keep going, even after learning of the dilemma.  ""Well, I'm just saying, it was very distracting.""  My brother, already upset about the details of the text message, had no patience, and promptly responded with, ""Oh shut up and get the fuck out of here, you old asshole.""  The man smirked, and high-tailed it out of there.",2018-03-19 21:29:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/85n8ng/aita_was_my_brother_an_asshole_at_the_movie/,23,16,0.95,0
88,ESH,AITA for ranting/complaining to my mom about issues I have with my sisters when our mom turns around and yells at them for it?,"My sisters can be very inconsiderate and selfish. I'm not going to distinguish between them much for the sake of simplicity which I know isn't completely fair, but they seem to have the same problem with the fact that I complain to our mom about frustrating things *they've* done such as: 

* letting an un-vaccinated stray kitten use my cat's litter box and leaving the spilled dirty litter all over my bedroom floor without cleaning it

* putting a puppy who I had crated in the living room in my bedroom while I was asleep with my cat and another dog who are afraid of/aggressive toward him

* ignoring me or yelling at me when I ask them not do do things like: 

1. feed the puppy around a food-aggressive dog  

2. leave the doors open so my cat can slip outside and potentially get hurt by loose dogs or speeding cars 

3. give my cat can-opened cans of tuna when she could cut her tongue on the sharp edges, etc.

I tend to lightly ask my sisters not to do things like this. They often ignore me or don't take me seriously and continue to do these things. In the past, when I've confronted them, they've immediately gotten defensive and/or blown up on me. If my light suggestions don't do anything and my more serious confrontations end in screaming matches, I find it difficult and impossible to try to talk to them about any issue I have.

So I rant. I rant to my mom, my boyfriend, and an online friend I have. My mom is quite aware of my sisters' inconsiderate behavior. She also yells a lot. Because I feel like my sisters ignore me and I can't talk to them without a screaming match, ranting to my mom and such is the only way I feel I can get my frustration out. I feel like venting is a natural thing to do when somebody's annoyed you and ignored you.

However, my mom then immediately calls up my sisters and yells at them, using what I've told her they've done as fuel, even though I don't ask her to. 

My mom is so bad about this that when I was struggling with a falling out with a friend I made in college, I told her about what I was going through, and she literally wrote that friend a nasty letter even though I never asked her to intervene. That friend came to me upset thinking I had told my mom to write her that letter, and I had to explain to her I had no idea what she was talking about and apologized that my mom had done that, then had to ask my mom why the hell she'd done that, etc.

Now my sisters, instead of apologizing for the things they've done to frustrate me, have a grudge against me since they get chewed out by my mom. 

Yesterday after another incident one sister told me that she and my other sister are positive that I *want* them to get in trouble, that I want my mom to do my ""dirty work"" for me, and that I'm not ranting to get out my frustrations, I'm obviously scheming because I like that they get chewed out. 

They think my mom gives me preferential treatment and babies me (ignoring the fact that my mom definitely yells at me too, just not because of things I've done to annoy my sisters, because I largely stay out of my sisters' way, *and* the fact that I try my best not to do inconsiderate shit which means I get yelled at less.)

Both sisters have said to me ""If you have a problem, you should come talk to me about it instead of getting mom to yell at us for you"", seemingly unaware of the fact that I *have* talked to them, politely suggested they not do these things that frustrate me multiple times and if I do actually confront them about a repeated issue it's going to end in them yelling at me. And I don't ask my mom to yell at them. Ever.

One sister thinks I should save ranting about them to my friends and that it's wrong for me to rant to my mom because of how she reacts. (As if she never, ever rants to my mom about things me or my other sister have done.)

I don't rant to my close in-person friends (except my bf) about the assholish things my sisters do because I don't want my friends to think badly of them. My mom is already aware of how inconsiderate they are sometimes, and she herself has dealt with their selfish actions (such as taking needed clothes and toiletries without asking and getting defensive when questioned about it, letting our family dogs and house get infested with fleas brought from her dog, etc.)

Since I know my mom is like this and will turn around and chew them out even if I ask her not to, am I the asshole for complaining to her about what they do at all? Am I subconsciously hoping they get yelled at whenever I do?

Again, I don't ask my mom to yell at them on my behalf, ever. She chooses to. She has said stuff like 'I'm going to talk to them' when I vent my frustrations, but ""talk"" doesn't mean ""immediately call them up and scream at them using my complaints as fuel to the point where they get upset and send me nasty messages"". 

I even brought up the fact to one sister that they've both ignored or blown up on me when I've tried to talk to them personally about issues, and she just dismisses it and deflects blame.

91,NAH,AITA for doing my final year uni project more than seeing my girlfriend ?,"AITA Me and my girlfriend are both in our final year of uni. Been together for a year and 5 months that have been so sick. I lost my dad a couple years ago to cancer and she has been a literal rock when it would have been so easy to walk away. The love is real

I have a 10,000 word politics dissertation due on May 8, of which I have about 4,000 words finished and 1,000 words in the editing process. I'm feeling good about it, I have no concerns about the length of time yet as I already have all my notes, it's just a matter of turning them into an essay. My girlfriend does chemistry and so has lots more smaller things due in, whereas mine makes up 1/3rd of my year.

Thing is we have very different working styles. We walk into the library each morning for around 9/9.30am and she has one break (lunch) and then likes to leave around 6pm. I like to stay until about 9/10pm and take lots of small breaks throughout the day (mainly cigs with friends). She says we aren't spending enough time together which I totally get, and that she doesn't understand why I would rather spend time with other friends than her. Like why do I go out to smoke or chill instead of finishing what I want to do that day and get home ASAP which is definitely her approach. I feel like the difference is I don't expect her to adopt my style of working, because I know it doesn't work for her.

Thing is, I know this is how I work best. Even at school and before I smoked a bit I always preferred to do a long slog with small breaks, rather than a really really intense day. Our styles of working are just completely opposite, but part of me doesn't want to sacrifice my dissertation and style of work especially when it's so close to being over. however, I do agree we aren't spending so much time together. But I also feel like that's to be expected: it's the final term of our final year of uni, no one is prioritising their social life ?

93,YTA,AITA for shooting my neighbors dog with a BB gun.,"This happened in August my neighbors had this white pit bull but weren't ever home to watch or take care of her. So she would wonder into our yard for food and after a while she would end up staying in our hard. So in our hard we have a basketball court and I would go out there alot to find that she was sitting there and would refuse to leave. And on top of that I think she had some kind of disease because she would take a dump everywhere and the ball would bounce in it all the time. So to make sure she didn't come back I started to bring my BB gun out. At first I would shoot warning shots, then after like a week she stopped being afraid of them. So I started to shoot close to her. She eventually got brave and wasnt afraid of those anymore. Then one day I had to shoo her away again. And I accidentally shot her. I felt no remorse and still don't feel remorse I would do it again. She came over a few more times after that but I dont remember ever shooting her again because as soon as I went for the BB gun she would run off. One day she went and hopped into somebodies car and I never saw her again thankfully (the persons car she jumped into was one of her owners cousins).
So that's the story so AITA for shooting my neighbors dog.

PS. Sometimes she would run into our yard at full speed like she was chasing something but nothing would be there and she would run in circles and off into someone else's yard.

My DD told her cousin this, who proceeded to tell her mother this, and I woke up this morning to a ""what is your problem with me"" text. Great, I thought, but figured NBD, I'll explain and she will get it. 

Instead she decided to spew a ton of venom (will link texts if you want, but someone will have to tell me how, lol!) And accuse me of all sorts of stuff I had no idea she had an issue with. Apparently my SIL has been harboring a grudge for some time.

Anyways, AITA? I probably should have never told my DD that, but I didn't think of it as ""talking shit"". If SIL would have asked of she could go, instead of going thru the kids, I would have told her the same damn  thing.
Im pretty upset about this; I always thought I had a good relationship with my SIL. 

Btw I live on the west coast, it's legal(as long as you aren't driving, etc) and I don't give two shits if you smoke weed. You just aren't driving my kid around while you are high.

95,YTA,AITA for making someone pay for their service even though it didn't go completely as planned?,"I'm a manager at a movie theater. One of my employees was selling tickets, and someone wanted to view a 3d showing of avengers but my employee hit the wrong button on accident and gave him a different movie. 3d showings of films are $3 more than normal films. The guest saw that he got the wrong thing and went into 3d avengers anyways. This stuff happens all the time, we call them swaps, and I do at least a dozen a day just because some kind of error usually happens.

When a movie has had no tickets sold for it, the computer after 15 minutes automatically stops playing because it doesn't need to. The guy was the only person in the 3d avengers and since he didn't actually buy it because the computer thought he got the movie the employee gave him on accident it shut itself off. So he asked for me to fix it, and I saw it had no seats sold so I asked to see his ticket. He gave it to me, I saw it was a different movie and not what he was watching, and I said I can fix it I just need to charge the extra 3 dollars because this is 3d. So he gave me his card, I did the swap and put the 3 dollar upcharge on it and gave it back.

After it was done he came out saying I treated him like a highschooler (he was probably in his 60s), and said he was gonna file a complaint about me. I explained that I was just fixing the mistake our employee had made because things happen like that around here, but he didn't care.

To summarize, guests asks for x and gets y on mistake, x is more expensive, he inquired as to why the thing he purchased isn't working, and then I fix it but only by adding on the difference in price x is from y. It definitely is our bad that we gave him the wrong thing and said he was ok at first, but I don't see the problem with charging him for what he wanted and not another item.",2018-05-17 08:06:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/8k2kji/aita_for_making_someone_pay_for_their_service/,17,4,0.7,0
96,ESH,AITA for using toilet paper my roommate technically paid for?,"So I've been subletting from this dude and we have a weird dynamic. I've been subletting for the past two months, but I started halfway of last month and still paid for the entire month because I figured it was petty to pay a half month's rent even though we met halfway through the month.

We don't have any guests or anything. I do all the cleaning, but since he lives in his room I'm also the one making the messes. It was a 2 month sublet so his stuff is like 97% and I contributed with a few pots and plates of my own.

97,YTA,AITA for placing deliberately unreasonable conditions on a loan I don't want to give?,"Jenna has been a friend of mine for years. We've not been terribly close, but we know each other well enough. She's a very attractive woman, though nothing ever happened between us.  

She is notoriously bad with money. In the past she borrowed money from me, insisted she'd pay it back, avoided me, and then never mentioned it again. Now I didn't bring it up again after that, except for the time I'm going to tell you about, but I did mentally blacklist her from getting a loan from me again.  

So a few weeks ago she begged me to front her $500 because she needed to pay a bill, but assured me she would pay me back without fail. I responded that I didn't have that kind of money available to loan out. She wouldn't let it go asking when I got paid, asking if I had it in savings, asking if I could take a cash advance on a credit card and promising I'd pay no interest because she'd get me everything back before the due date.  I brought up that she hadn't paid me back previously, and she simply said she'd add it on to this loan and pay me back in full.  

I decided to call her bluff. I informed her that I would loan her the money provided that she would put up collateral. When she asked what she could put up, I responded the clothes off her back. I informed her that if she didn't pay me back on time, she would, at my request, strip down to nothing; not more than once a week, until she was fully paid up.  

She flat out refused, calling me disgusting and a pervert. I responded, ""But Jenna, you're going to pay me back before a single cent of interest needs to be paid, right? This shouldn't even be an issue!""  

She's since gone to several mutual friends and said that I propositioned her in her time of need and was trying to take advantage. Some friends, who have gotten burned as well, sympathize and understand why I set that condition. Others are not talking to me because they feel I'm taking advantage.

100,YTA,AITA Minor offenses (I feel) end a 4 year long friendship,"So it all started when I tossed a retracted x-acto knife (I made sure it was safe before I sent it on its way) past my friend who doesn't like having things thrown or tossed at/near her. She says it triggers her PTSD which is understandable, so I apologized and said I would try to avoid throwing or tossing harmless objects at her.

Apparently this offense stressed her so badly that she ended up crying over it and was incredibly afraid and belittled because I chuckled at her flinching and anger towards me for tossing the x-acto blade handle at her.

Then 2 weeks later I had came back with her DS that I had borrowed and left finger nail marks in the analog stick which I said I would fix, but she was having none of that because it would break warranty and said she would just buy a new one. On my way out I was swinging the plastic bag it was in to and fro, like I do when you're standing idly with a bag in hand. I didn't learn until a few days later that this was also a big no-no and incredibly disrespectful to her belongings.

On the back of these three offenses and causing such a hub-ub about the cosmetic damage I called her a spoiled child, which she responded with she doesn't want to talk to me again, which I feel are pretty minor and much worse has been done to me in the past which I moved on from. Then while angry, I said something I am not proud of, but nowhere along the line was throwing out obscenities. I just worry that I am being insensitive to other people? I get the feeling that there was some other reason she didn't want to be friends, but used these as an excuse.

Now I don't want to send the DS to repair at nintendo because its >$75 where I could do it for $15 if she'd let me void warranty. So also opinions on selling this current one and buying a new one with the proceeds? A refurb off of the nintendo website is $125

EDIT - Since the conclusion has been reached that I am an asshole, what are people's preferred repair option? Brand new, refurb, or repair current one? I am leaning to a buying a refurb one, but the nintendo website says that it may have minor cosmetic damage which is what caused the problem in the first place. The DS wasn't in mint shape when I got it either though.

104,YTA,AITA for lashing out at a customer service rep and slandering a company online?,"Now, this is a story of how i helped my grandmother with her tv. My grandmother has had Directv since 2005, we have been loyal, she's always made the payments on time, been loyal since the start.

Now, here's what happened. We have At&t for our internet and phone, and Directv for our TV. Now, they had been pushing her and pushing her to bundle everything to save money. She was skeptical at first, but eventually called to set it up.


Now, keep in mind, my mom lives with her. She's the one who helped set up the internet and phone for my grandmother, so the bill was in her name. While DirecTV was in my grandmother's name.

So, to bundle, you actually have to have the newer boxes, we've pretty much had the same boxes since the beginning. We never upgraded to a new box (one that had DVR, OnDemand movies, and everything else).


So, then a technician came out and set all our new equipment up. Now, i hate to be a jerk, but this guy was WAY too old to do his job. He seemed very senile, we asked some basic questions about the features, and the man seemed to have to idea what he was talking about. He also marked one of the remotes,the one for the tv in my bedroom, he labeled it for the ""Bathroom"", which we don't even have a tv in there.


Now, my mom is the one who did most of the talking to him. She knows more about this then my grandmother. Now, she told him countless times that we wanted to switch the Directv account to my mom's name, that way everything else would be bundled. However, this dumbass didn't transfer it over or change the name of the account. He just opened a brand new account in Mom's name. The old man had no idea what he was doing.


So, the end of the month came, and we got our bill. Or rather 2 bills. One in my grandma's name for her old equipment (which he hauled away) and for the new equipment in my mom's name. That's right, we were getting charged TWICE.


Tell me, does this make sense to you? Does it? Do you understand our problem?


Good, that means you have a higher I.Q. then the doofuses who work Directv's customer service. But apparently, Directv can't understand that. We spent hours on the phone trying to explain this to them.


So, we didn't know what to do. We did close the account in my grandma's name, we tried to anyway, but when we did...somehow our tv got shut off. We called back, and they said they also cancelled the one in mom's name because they thought it was ""fraudulent"", because the bank card we used (in my grandma's name) was the same one on file for the old one.


Yeah, they had a hard time understanding that too.


Also, funnily enough, the bill was NEVER bundled. We still got different bills for internet and tv. Not only that, but we were also getting charged MORE. Originally, it was over 150 dollars for both Phone, Tv and internet seperately (combined together), but if it was bundled, it would only cost $130 for all (according to the guy who asked us to bundle). But, our first Directv bill was for 300 DOLLARS!


And a month later, our tv was shut off. Somehow the old account was still open. It was just a big mess. It was because we weren't paying is what customer service said. We had been paying, just somehow on the old account. We tried to explain we didn't have the old equipment anymore, the whole dog and pony show again. They said they were ""Not responsible for damage to their equipment"". And guess what?!, We didn't pay the bill, we didn't have the money. We called and told them this, they said it would be fine and gave us a later date. Not likely, because they went into her bank account and took EVERY DIME she had out of the bank. Without warning. We didn't even have auto-pay enabled.


So, i had to call customer service again. I was fed up with it, and i kind of just wanted to lash out at anyone. I admit it. Now, the customer service lady was Indian. The call center was in India. ANd i had a hard time understanding her. She told us that we hadn't been paying, and to send back our equipment and it would cost somewhere like 600 dollars to get it cut back on. I just started yelling at her. One thing i'm not proud of is i made fun of her ethnicity.


Here's how the end of that conversation went, after she told me that.


""Wait a minute, God Damn it. Are you in India right now?""


She was quiet for a bit. ""Umm, yes sir but i don't see...""


I shouted and interupted her ""Well i want to talk to someone in the God damn united states, instead of you scamming sons of bitches! Cause we have been sending payment after payment to you rag-headed motherfuckers!""


She was completely flustered, i could tell ""Sir, please calm down, there's no need for that.""


""Oh, shut up!. I want to talk to somebody who can speak english, i don't need to talk to you sons of bitches!"" and i hung up.


Keep in mind, i am ashamed of how i acted with that woman. There was no need to call her racial slurs, but i was so fed up with that company.


In response to this, i made a very angry youtube video about it, wrote angry blogs, and kind slandered the company, i called them a scam artist on Twitter as well.",2018-07-12 07:18:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/8y7lhl/aita_for_lashing_out_at_a_customer_service_rep/,16,3,0.64,0
105,YTA,WIBTA if I told my friend she’s being obnoxious about her new house?,"Ok here’s the context

So a friend of mine is building a house. It’s brand new and she’s all excited about it and talking about it heaps which I’m fine with. She tells me the builder and the house design and it turns out that we were considering building that exact house at one point but after a lot of deliberation we chose to buy a smaller place in a more expensive area instead. 

We laugh about the coincidence then the next time we see each other she tells my husband “oh when it’s built you’ll have to come and see what you could have had.” We all laugh again. 

She has now said that phrase every. Single. Fucking time I have seen her since. “You’ll have to come and see what you could have had.” I mean once was a laugh and I get that she’s excited but I’m getting really fucked off now because it’s like she’s insinuating that somehow we settled for less when we deliberately made this decision. 

I was happy for her in the beginning but now I have the urge to slap her every time she brings it up. I do t generally believe in raining on people’s parade and shutting on their good fortune but I want to tell her that it’s not what we ‘could have had’ because we would have different decor etc. to her anyway.

She had helped me out through rough times and we have bonded as really close friends through our mutual hobbies. 

When I told my girlfriend (let's call her Kelly) about the matching ring I got for Emily, she told me that she felt weird about me giving this as a gift to another woman, and that it hurt her. Kelly feels that giving a matching ring as a gift is a very intimate thing, but I just don't see it that way. To me it is a token of friendship, and I don't see it as much different than when Kelly shares clothes with her guy friends. These rings are pure silver and there are matching diamonds on it.

109,YTA,AITA for having a problem with my work schedule?,"Bit of background first, I work at a movie theater that has multiple managers. I regularly work with all of them, but the same manager does the schedule every week. This week, that manager is on vacation, and another manager took over the scheduling for this week.

So, when I first got hired at this theater, I was told it was company policy to have open availability for at least 3 of the 6 weekend shifts. Because of this, I initially set my weekend availability as Friday nights only, Saturday days and nights, and no Sundays. Initially though, I was hired specifically to work ONLY the day shift Monday-Friday. I was and still am basically the only worker who works those hours. I do so every week, and have been for nearly a year.

Due to this set-up, the usual scheduling manager basically made an exception to the policy for me because I already get the max allowed hours by working the day shifts five days a week. In fact, if I was scheduled any more than that, it would be a problem for them because I'm technically part-time, and am not supposed to work more than 40 hours per week. So my usual schedule is 38 hours per week Monday-Friday during the day.

HOWEVER, this week the replacement scheduling manager took away my usual Friday day shift, and replaced it with a Saturday closing shift. It's the first time I've been given that shift since my first two weeks there. I built my weekly routine around my normal schedule, and now this shift is going to screw up a bunch of plans I had made for Saturday night.

So, when I brought this up to the replacement scheduling manager using the same points, she basically told me to suck it up since the policy is that I have to be available for that shift regardless of the fact that I haven't worked that shift in almost a year. She said the only way I could get out of that shift is to trade with a co-worker, which I tried to do with the employee who normally works that shift, who actually got my usual Friday day shift instead. 

Of course, said co-worker won't trade because they also don't want to work that shift because they know it sucks, and that I should be fine with working it since I ""always get the easy shifts."" This coming from a co-worker who only works like 3-4 shifts a week.

So am I the asshole for getting pissed about this issue?

111,YTA,AITA for wanting to make the money?,"I bought tickets to a high profile event and got lucky enough to be able to buy them at face value. ($350).

But in the off chance that he could go, I made sure to at least get him a seat. After I told the third friend about the ticket he wrote me a check and I deposited it into my account and email him the ticket.

Fast forward to now, and he tells me he cant go. So I want to sell his ticket and plan on asking more money for it than I paid for it. (I know it sounds shady, but I did not buy with anticipation to sell, but it would help offset the cost of the hotel room since its being split one less way.)

113,YTA,AITA for dumping my boyfriend over what he claims is a misunderstanding?,"AITA for dumping my boyfriend over what he claims is a misunderstanding?

I am 31F, he is 27M. Like most people my age, I am 100% for weed legalization, for all the typical reasons. That said, I don’t use it myself. I just don’t like mind-altering substances. I smoked recreationally way back in college, but fewer than five times since then. Weed is just not for me and I don’t want to partner with who is a habitual user either. I’m fine with someone who safely drinks/smokes a few times a month but no more. I’m just not really into using any substances and I want a partner who’s roughly on the same page.

Enter H, my boyfriend of 1 year. When H was a kid, his mom was in and out of his life, generally a shit parent, so H was raised mostly by his dad and grandparents. H and his mother have reconnected in the last few years and she feels guilty that she missed much of his childhood, so she tries to compensate for that by being his buddy, which includes the two of them smoking weed together when he visits. He visits her 1-3 times a month, has dinner at her house, and they share a joint afterward. I’ve never given him a hard time about it.

I met H on Reddit, so we don’t have total control over the geography. I’m in DC and he lives in North Carolina, about 5 hours’ drive away. Earlier this year we began spending a lot more time together, or rather, he began spending a lot of time at my apartment because I have to be here for work and he’s more flexible. I keep normal office hours as an attorney. H is in school full time, but since coming here he’s been able to manage his classes by viewing lectures online, etc. So basically he’s a full time student who studies remotely and only needs to go to campus for tests. He travels home 1-3 times a month, depending what’s going on that month. He’s usually home for about 4 days at a time. We were planning for him to officially move here when he finishes school next year and starts his career.

He knows I don’t want a partner who smokes or drinks habitually, and he’s always maintained that he only smokes when he visits his mom. Back before he started spending a lot of time at my home, we had a discussion where I told him that I don’t want him bringing weed into my home or smoking it here. He agreed not to bring it here, with no fuss. “It’s not even a thing, I swear!” he said. For full disclosure, part of it is that it would look bad and make me lose respect for myself. I’m the only one working, paying for rent and utilities and groceries and restaurants and anything fun that we do. I understand he’s in a pickle—he really can’t get a part-time job in DC or NC because he’s constantly driving back and forth between school and me. He pays for small things when he can, but I’m not asking him to make large or ongoing financial contributions at all, even though he’s here like 80% of the time. I just ask that he keep the place clean, handle his school stuff (he has a 3.96 GPA in STEM), and be cool. I’m fine with our arrangement, but I am NOT paying for somebody to sit at my house and smoke weed while I’m working to support us both. Student who can’t work because of logistics but is productive and helps in other ways—totally fine. Student who can’t work because of logistics and spends free time smoking weed at my house while I work—not fine at all. He knew this and agreed it would be a “bad look.”

Things have been mostly good. We’ve had some growing pains, but overall it is a really wonderful relationship. We have a great connection, are similar in our weirdness, and love each other very much. Recently we’ve started talking timelines for possibly getting engaged, etc., so it’s definitely been moving in a serious direction, this isn’t a casual thing.

On Wednesday after I got home from work we decided to go out for dinner. When we got into his car, it smelled like weed. I said, “It smells like weed in here. Were you smoking weed in here?” I wasn’t even serious. I figured it was just residual from his last visit home that I hadn’t noticed. He started laughing and said something like, “Promise you won’t get too upset.” So obviously it came out that he had smoked weed in his car while I was at work earlier. Then he noticed I was mad and the tone changed. I asked him how often he was doing it, and when it had started, and he kept refusing to answer, just saying things like, “It’s really occasional,” “it’s really not a big deal,” “I really didn’t think you’d care that much,” etc. I have no idea when he started or how often he was doing it, so I’m obviously assuming that this has been an ongoing thing since the beginning.

Then he started trying to weasel his way out of trouble.

I say the biggest deal isn’t the weed itself, it’s the deception. I say he has been lying to me by hiding it. He says he hasn’t been lying because he “just didn’t mention it” and he admitted it when I asked outright. I call bullshit. Who’s the asshole?

I say he broke his promise not to bring weed to my home or smoke it here. He says he didn’t because he didn’t actually smoke in my apartment, he only smoked in his car in the parking garage. I gave him the dirtiest look and he says, “Well, I guess it’s the spirit of the thing, but still... I didn’t smoke in your apartment.” I call bullshit. Who’s the asshole?

I say this is a big fucking deal because he deliberately deceived me for who-knows-how-long. He says this isn’t a big fucking deal because I know he smokes weed with his mom sometimes and I don’t give him a hard time about it, so he had reason to think I wouldn’t really mind. I call bullshit. Who’s the asshole?

I say he broke his promise because we discussed beforehand that I didn’t want weed in my home or near me. He says he misunderstood and didn’t realize it was a big serious thing, he thought I meant I just didn’t like the look of it but it wouldn’t be a big deal if it was just occasional, and not literally inside my apartment, and not in front of me. I call bullshit. Who's the asshole?

I dumped him on the spot despite his protests, packed his things and sent him on his way immediately. Didn’t even go to dinner. He was sad and kept insisting he didn’t know it was a big deal, didn’t know it was such a serious thing to me, he had no idea it was an actual deal-breaker, loves me so much, etc. I basically gave him a hug and told him to fuck off. He wants another chance but I'm skeptical. I thought we were clear before but I don’t want to throw away an otherwise good relationship if there’s a solid chance it really was a misunderstanding that won’t be repeated. Then again, I feel like the trust has just been completely broken, that I’ll always be wondering if he’s smoking while I’m at work and playing me for a fucking idiot. Am I the asshole or is he?

115,ESH,AITA for being angry and cancelling on my grandparents(and kinda not giving a shit about my mom)?,"First some backstory. My parents are in a bitter divorce and I currently live with my mom. I want to move in with my dad(over the summers, in the fall I will be going to college) because my mom is becoming increasingly disconnected from what is actually good for me(I got mediocre grades in HS and she thinks it has to do with me and I say it's at least in part because she is completely unapproachable and she makes me nervous about grades)

My dad has to go to court to gain physical custody, and I am backing him 100%. Now for the potential assholery.

I thought my grandparents(on my mother's side) weren't a part of this. I had a lunch planned with them to go to this restaurant they found. I thought it would be a nice lunch just my grandparents and me. Then my phone rang. It's my grandparents. I thought it was going to be about the lunch(this was a about 7am the day of). This is how the call goes:

Me: hello?

Grandma: do you know what you do to your mother? She cries every night about you

Me: --

Me: *hangs up*

I was completely unprepared for this confrontation. I seriously doubt that my mom cries that often about this. Either way that was a loaded question and i didn't want to continue the phone call.

Fast forward to noon-ish.

My grandparents arrive. They ask if I disconnected. I didn't lie, I told them I hung up. They asked more questions about the situation, a lot of which I didn't answer. Here are some of the ones I did answer:

Grandparents: so we can't be involved in this?

Me: why do you need to be?

Grandparents: she's our daughter

----

Grandparents: why did you hang up?

Me: I hung up because that is a pretty inappropriate thing to talk about before a nice lunch

----

Grandparents: are we still having lunch?

Me: Nope. You ruined this lunch.

----

Grandparents: What about [cousins] that will be there?

Me: you ruined the lunch

(Note: I had no foreknowledge that my cousins would be there)

----

>Now for some questions I didn't answer

Grandparents: Are you not going to see us again?

Me (thinking): I don't know I'm pretty pissed, but I'm not sure who to be pissed at. Mom probably put you up to this but you are going through with it. Silence

----

Grandparents: (I forget the exact wording but basically insinuating that my dad is a failed parent)

I didn't really think so much as feel in reaction to this. There have been a few bumps in the road with the relationship with my dad(but in retrospect I think it's due to the limited contact and that I was projecting my mom onto my dad.) but I get along far better with my dad. I love him and this was just out of line. I storm out of the room and into the backyard. Last time someone said something like this it was someone who wasn't family so I yelled and I probably would have started swearing like a sailor if it wasn't at a very important meeting. I didn't want to do that but I couldn't not react to that in some way.

----

Grandparents: are we going to have to leave angry at each other

Me: (as calmly as I can manage)please leave

----

Grandparents: do you still love us?

Me: please leave(they ask a few other questions that I don't remember but at that point I was just repeating please leave)


After they left, I haven't spoken to them since(this happened towards the beginning of the month). I don't know what I might say because I'm so angry, but I haven't had a good outlet for it and I might just explode. The thing is, they are *grand*parents and they won't be around for much longer.

TL;DR was going to have lunch with grandparents, they talk about a sensitive divorce issue, I hang up on them and don't answer many questions and I haven't talked to them since

116,YTA,AITA for not liking how my girlfriend dresses for work?,"So I (43M) don’t think I’m in the wrong here, but my mother is very angry at me, and my best friend said I was a horrible person for saying what I did and I’d be lucky if my girlfriend didn’t put me out with the garbage, since I decided I wanted to act like trash.

My girlfriend (34F) is a preschool teacher and for some reason I can’t explain she dresses like Ms. Frizzle. Like a dress with the pattern of whatever they are studying. She makes a lot of them herself, now including matching masks. The kids love it, and the parents seem to think it’s great. I don’t like the amount of attention she gets honestly. I’d prefer if she came home and changed before running any errands.

On Friday, she helped my mom with something after work and she was still in her weird dress. I have told her before I don’t like when she dresses that way, but she tells me I don’t have to like it, but I have no right to tell her how to dress. I was upset she went out like that with my mother, and told her that my mom said she was embarrassed and to ask that she please not dress like that again if they’re going out. I was not expecting her to call my mom and apologize. When my mom asked what she meant, she told her what I said. My mom was furious, explained she doesn’t have a problem with how my girlfriend dresses and thinks it’s great she spends extra time doing things to engage her students. My mom then yelled at me for lying to my girlfriend and trying to throw her under the bus because I was being an insecure jerk.

My girlfriend and I got into a huge fight. I said she should be embarrassed to be seen in public like that. She said the only thing she was embarrassed by was me. She hasn’t spoken to me or done anything for me since. My friend said I was horrible and called me trash. I shouldn’t have lied, but I think my girlfriend should take what I think about her clothes into consideration and I’m not sorry for expecting her dress more appropriately in public. Am I really such an asshole here?

EDIT: I’m sure you all will be pleased to know we broke up tonight. She said I’m to controlling and narrow minded so she broke up with me.  ",2020-11-10 20:07:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jrsflx/aita_for_not_liking_how_my_girlfriend_dresses_for/,5753,18831,0.8,26
117,YTA,"AITA for ""ruining"" the rice that my boyfriend cooks with by consolidating the multiple bags of rice which he claims are ""different"" into a single container?","I (26F) moved in with my boyfriend (23M) earlier this year. He is kind of disorganized so I tend to have to tidy things up a lot. He often complains that I ""misplace"" his things, but it's really just his lack of organization more than anything. He keeps telling me to stop moving his things around, but we live here together so I don't see why I should stop doing that.

Anyway, he happens to be the one who does most of the cooking, and I'd say he's pretty good at it. One thing that does bother me is that he keeps multiple huge bags of rice in the kitchen, which he claims are different types of rice. But I looked at them and they're all just the same white rice. I told him that he should put it in a proper container, but he insists that it's just fine the way it is. But the thing is, I don't think that it's fine the way it is.

So yesterday, I decided to consolidate all of the rice by getting a huge tub to put all of the rice in. I dumped all three bags in there and put it in the pantry. When I texted my boyfriend and told him where I put the rice, he completely freaked out and said that I ""ruined"" the rice. He texted me that I can't mix basmati rice with jasmine rice, but it's all just white rice! I don't see how it's any less edible. When he came home he just started yelling at me, and it was really hurtful because I was doing him a favor.

118,YTA,AITA for expecting my kids to attend all family holidays?,"I (52M) never had a big family unit growing up. My dad bailed when I was a baby and I was just my mom and I after that. I was often jealous of friends who would have big family celebrations. My wife and I have three children Alice (27F) Jeff (24M) and Kevin (22M)—Fake names. I always thought my kids would spend all the holidays with us, because I always stressed how important it was to me to have them all home with me. 

I did a zoom call with the three yesterday and they broke the news to me that none of them would be coming home for Thanksgiving. I got upset and Alice interrupted me to remind me that she and Jeff worked in fields and that they would sometimes have to work holidays. (She’s a x-ray technician in a hospital and Jeff is a dispatcher for 911) and that she was married now and she knew I wanted us all home for every holiday but that just wasn’t realistic. I asked Kevin what his excuse was and he said he was going to stay with his girlfriend because she just had surgery and wanted to care for her.

I said they needed to get their priorities straight and they knew it was important to their mother and I that they attend. Jeff said that my wife understood and I was the one who constantly tried to guilt trip them into rearranging their lives to make me happy and he hated that I refused to let them live their lives without trying to guilt trip them into doing what I want. Alice said it wasn’t up for discussion and I could either accept they wouldn’t always be there or I could celebrate without her from here on out because she was done dealing with me trying to make her feel guilty for having a life. They disconnected after that.

I am very upset, and think I deserve more respect than this, but my wife says it’s unreasonable to think the kids would always come home and just because I wanted something didn’t mean it was going to happen and I needed to stop acting like an asshole to get my way.

I guess she wasn't a good mom the first time around, very neurotic and controlling, and she wanted a do over baby. I mean i've heard some horror stories about her, and she can be kind of a narc in general, but I love my mom. I had a baby girl six months ago and named her Kalia, in honor of my mom, Lia.

My older siblings were pissed. My brother kept making comments about that poor baby, and why didn't i just name her Jezebel. His wife was annoyed about how she is automatically going to be the favorite, and my sister took it the worst. She got very mad at me, saying my mom doesn't deserve that and it isn't fair.

Despite the weird dynamic with our mom, we do get along for the most part. They are always nice to Kalia, but they call her K or baby. I really don't like K and I want her called Kalia. I brought it up nicely and my brother said he can't say the word Lia without wanting to gag, and my sister said it makes her mad every time she says it. I said i'm sorry, but it is her name.

They continue to call her K, which my mom has picked up on, and it hurts her, but most importantly it isn't her name. Kalia is her own person and has nothing to do with whatever my mom did years ago. I finally told them if they can't call her by her name, they can't be around her, so i won't be inviting them to my house or letting them have much of an aunt/uncle roll.

120,YTA,AITA For telling my daughter in law to toughen up,"My wife and I are in our 60s and nearing retirement. We have 3 sons in their 20s and 30s, the older two are married and the oldest has a 1-year old son. We all live within an hour of each other, but due to the pandemic we have not gotten together much the last 6 months. We even had to do a zoom call for my grandson's 1st birthday since his parents didn't want a group gathering. With Thanksgiving coming up, we have all been staying home and taking every precaution so that we can all get together for the holiday. My oldest son and his wife will be hosting.

The other day in the family group chat, my two DILs and my wife were venting about the pandemic and how hard and exhausting it all has been trying to juggle working from home, childcare, family, etc.  I made a lighthearted joke about them toughening up and told them all to grow a pair. My oldest son's wife sent a long message about how that kind of language is damaging and that if I ever said anything like that to her son, that it would be the last thing I said to him. She also sent a link to an article about toxic masculinity.  

I read the article and then sent my DIL a private message telling her that I read it but that I don't agree with it and she should stop whining. She didn't respond, so the next morning I sent her another message telling her we should strive to have a complaint-free day.  She didn't respond to that either.  

Well last night, my oldest son called to tell us that they will no longer be hosting Thanksgiving. He said that their daycare had a covid scare and they have to get their son tested. He said that they no longer want to host and will be staying home as a family instead. My wife is very upset by this as she loves family holidays and not having all her sons around this year has been very hard on her. 

I called my son to tell him this and to try to change his mind. I told him that as long as their son tests negative, that there is no reason we can't all still get together. I told him that we have all been staying home and taking precautions and I didn't want that to be for nothing and that his mother is distraught over this. He told me this wasn't a debate or a negotiation, he and his wife have made their decision. He then said he loved me but that I'm an asshole and should stop whining and complaining then he hung up.

My wife is still very upset that we won't see everyone for the holiday, but now she's also pissed off at me because apparently my son and DIL told her what I said to DIL and my wife agrees with them that I was a jerk.",2020-11-17 15:00:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jvuf3g/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_in_law_to_toughen_up/,1882,9768,0.91,9
121,YTA,AITA for hiding from my wife the reason why our son got kicked out of a restaurant?,"Our son told me the truth but did not tell her because he was afraid of his mom's reaction. Ordinarily I would have told my wife but the situation ultimately was a misunderstanding and something I was able to quickly resolve with the restaurant owner.

He and his friends had gone out to eat at this place, and apparently my son decided to make a joke and hit on their waitress. Others said things too but his was the one that upset her and resulting in her telling the owner. It wasn't a bad joke or what I'd consider sexist, but it was in poor taste. When she told the owner, he got upset and asked the boys to leave.

They were all embarrassed and told us that they left because they weren't feeling well instead of the real reason. At least at first. My son told me what really happened, and one of his friends ended up also telling his mom the truth after she questioned his story. By the time he confessed, I'd already talked with my son and the owner of the restaurant and worked things out. My son and the rest of the boys aren't banned from the restaurant and everything is fine now.

I saw no need to involve my wife in this because she would have escalated this when our son was already embarrassed and had learned his lesson. There wasn't anything else to say or do.

My wife disagrees and thinks I am the asshole for hiding the truth from her and for enabling our son's sexism, as she puts it. She doesn't think I've actually done anything except teach him that he can say and do what he wants without consequences. This is because I didn't punish him and convinced the restaurant owner to ""look the other way."" In this case I didn't feel more needed to be said or done because what he said wasn't that bad and he seemed sorry.

Now that the other parents know what happened everyone is split. Most of the dads agree with me and have similar views while the moms are taking the same view as my wife. So am I the asshole?

Edit: Since some are asking for the joke.  The waitress they had was Indian, so my son said that he no longer felt like he was in the mood for Italian and wanted that instead. He then asked her if she could help him with that. ",2020-11-20 00:44:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jxf45n/aita_for_hiding_from_my_wife_the_reason_why_our/,1806,8176,0.89,8
122,YTA,AITA For pulling out 10k from our joint account without telling my wife first?,"
I M37 am currently dealing with a horrible situation. My dad was Admitted to the hospital and is in need of a heart surgery that he should've gotten months ago. He's already dealing with complications and his cardiologist recommeneded the surgery sooner.

Both my wife and I work. We have a joint account that we both use but she contributes more because she has been saving up to renovate the house. She knows about my dad's condition and we both discussed the possibilty of giving my family money to help with the cost of the surgery. She told me that I needed to do all i can to help my dad. Last week I was able to pull out 10k from our account and put it into my family's account then i told them about it. My wife found out after she contacted the bank the next day not giving me the chance to tell her myself as if she was checking to see if i took any money from the account and she blew up on me when i got home after visiting my family.

She called me a thief and a liar which was a shock for me and I was really hurt by that. Especially when she told me i needed to support my family. She told me that i shouldn't have given my family 10k saying it was a lot and that she now can't renovate the house with the money left in the account.

She said that I threw away the hard work to save up money and kept lashing out on me the entire day.

She's expecting me to return the money saying she was the one who contributed more and that my family should start thinking of fixing their own problems instead of asking for money.",2020-11-26 14:49:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k1ggh9/aita_for_pulling_out_10k_from_our_joint_account/,1272,4767,0.92,3
123,YTA,"AITA for trying to ""force"" my step son to move out of his bedroom so my daughter can move in?","I have never used this site before but my daughter uses it pretty regularly and suggested that I post here.

I have a daughter and a stepson who I will call Carly and Kyle \[Carly-15 & Kyle-18\]. They have never been particularly close. Kyle tends to avoid myself and Carly like the plague, he hasn't bothered ever trying to build a relationship with us.

I have been with Kyle's dad since the kids were 10 & 13. Due to some personal troubles which I'll not go to into detail about, Kyle stays with his dad though his mother will visit fairly regularly and they are in constant contact. She, of course, believes me to be the asshole in this situation.

Kyle has stayed in the attic since I knew him. His parents had the attic converted into a proper bedroom for him when he was around 9 or 10. It is an absolutely stunning room. Plenty of space, nice furniture and it is currently inhabited by several dressmaking dummies as he is studying fashion at university.

Lately, Carly has asked me if she can stay with me full time. She and her dad are just not getting on and she'd prefer living with me. Her dad is absolutely fine with this as he was never really good with her in the first place. This means that the majority of Carly's things will be at our place. She has a lot more things than Kyle and would most likely need more space. That's why I thought it'd be a better idea to have Kyle move into Carly's slightly smaller bedroom downstairs and Carly can move into the attic bedroom. I even offered to pay for whatever Kyle wants for his new bedroom \[regarding wallpaper, paint, posters etc.\] as I know it is a bit of a change for him.

Kyle is not a fan of the idea and has been complaining about how he needs the space to work on his uni projects. I told him that he is more than welcome to use the dining room as we rarely ever use it and we can clean out one of the storage cupboards to store the dummies in. Kyle's partner is also not a fan of this though I am almost 100 percent sure that this is just because in the attic bedroom, they can do what teenagers do without interruption. I think that Kyle is being a bit over dramatic about this as I'm not kicking him out into the street, just into a smaller bedroom, which I have offered to decorate for him.

His father is not completely sold on the idea but is slowly coming around. He also thinks that Kyle is being a bit dramatic regarding the room situation. Kyle's mother and girlfriend and of course Kyle himself, all think that I'm being an asshole.

Am I the Asshole?

Edit -

The people who are bringing up Kyle paying rent. He pays us £100 dig money per month. He wanted to start paying rent to help his dad out, we did not force him and we will be expecting Carly to start paying rent when she'd old enough too so that Kyle is not singled out.

Yes, Kyle's dad did cheat on his ex with me. His ex wife was in a bad place and it put a lot of stress on Kyle's dad. I had not long divorced my husband \[Carly's dad\] and was in a bad place. We got drunk and did something stupid. Neither of us intended for it to turn into anything more. But it did. I regret my comment about how Kyle's mum should've got her shit together, I was a bit stressed when I wrote that.

Lastly, regarding the absurd claims that I am biphobic/homophobic. I am not. My brother is a gay man and one of my best friends is a bisexual gentleman. Kyle's relationship up until this point have barely made it past two months. He sleeps around when he's not in a relationship with someone \[thankfully not in the house as that can be dangerous\]. I do not want Carly thinking this behaviour is okay as I know how dangerous it can be. Kyle is not my son, he has made that abundantly clear, but I have provided him with condoms in the past to make sure he stays safe. I just don't want Carly to start acting like him.

Finally, you'll all be very glad to know that I'm not pushing the subject any further. Kyle can keep his room. I'll just tell Carly that she's going to get rid of her belongings. Thank you.

Second and last edit - 

I was stressed when I wrote about making Carly get rid of her things. She's going to put her thing in the storage cupboard and the dining room. I wouldn't make my child throw her things away, I was just angry. Also my worries about Kyle are on now way the same as what happened with his dad and I. We were drunk, it was a stupid mistake that turned into something more. I was not sleeping around, Kyle's dad was the only one that it happened with. Kyle has multiple sexual partners and I worry that he isn't being safe all the time and that this could be a bad influence on Carly. 

Kyle is keeping his bedroom. Carly is making do with the smaller bedroom. She has also found the thread and is upset with the amount of hate she is getting in the comments. Does it make you lot feel good to make a teenage girl cry? You guys can call me whatever you want, I might even deserve it, but my daughter has done nothing wrong. Though I'll be sure to let Kyle know that you lot have deemed him ""Mister Perfect"".

124,YTA,AITA for telling my wife that if she doesn't want me in the delivery room she can find someone else to drive her to the hospital?,"I can add more information if people need or want it, but I'll try to only include what I think is relevant.

My wife is pregnant and has told me that she wants her sister in the delivery room. She is only allowed one person, so this means I'm out and won't be with her when she gives birth to our baby. It would be an understatement to say that I was disappointed, crushed, hurt, etc. when she told me this is what she was thinking. I had been excited about being there with her and experiencing that moment ever since she told me she was pregnant - really even since we started trying to get pregnant. I just always assumed she would want me there. Note the distinction here between me expecting to be there versus expecting her to want me there. I am pointing this out because what's worse than the disappointment is her rejecting me and basically telling me that she feels like someone else could give her better support while giving birth. That's really made me feel like a POS and worthless husband and father.

I've tried not to take it to heart or personally, but I don't know how else to take that kind of rejection. It doesn't help that she's really given no reason for why she feels like her sister would do a better job of supporting her. I know that her sister has had kids herself, but when I asked my wife if that was part of it she said not really. I then asked her if I had done something wrong or failed in some way or if she was upset with me, and she said it wasn't anything I'd done and she wasn't trying to punish me. She just felt like it would be better to have her sister there. I've asked for clarifications and that's as specific as she gets. It doesn't seem like she has a real list of reasons why her sister was chosen. It's just a feeling. Either that or she is lying to me and won't give me the real reason.

I had hoped she'd change her mind, but she's now confirmed this is how it will be. All of the things I've written about led me to tell her that if she really feels that way then I think it'd be better if her sister or someone else drove her to the hospital. Otherwise I'm just her taxi driver.

Once she realized that I was serious she lost it and told me I was acting like a child and pouting. I can accept that it's her choice, but if she doesn't want my support in the delivery room then why would she want it on the way to the hospital or at any other time? That's illogical, so there's no point in me doing that either.

She decided to go stay with her family for a few days and since she has I am being constantly bombarded by both sides of the family and friends of ours telling me to let this go and stop being an asshole. I know they are trying to help, but I don't think they understand the situation and just want it resolved so they can all feel better. Just looking to confirm if I am as bad as they think I am.

&#x200B;

Edit: I appreciate the comments, even the ones that were harsh, but as it turns out this post is moot. After talking with some of you last night, I reached out to my wife this morning about the state of things and our relationship. Mostly I wanted to know if she was planning to come home any time soon. She said that she wasn't, as I had suspected. She confirmed what I'd guessed which is that she has no plans to come back any time soon, so someone in her family will be driving her anyway. I'm not really upset by that. I still feel it's for the best and I think she does too. We'll see what happens after the baby is born but I don't think it's likely we'll stay together, and given our differences and differing views on marriage that may be for the best anyway. I feel like our relationship has run it course and we're not a good fit for each other. I had already contacted a divorce attorney just to discuss a possible separation and things I might need to do to prepare for divorce, so I'll go ahead and start making plans assuming we're divorcing. I probably will end up doing a paternity test so I can confirm the baby is actually mind since some of your are saying you don't believe it is.

125,YTA,AITA for ordering an expensive meal?,"My girlfriend and I are going through a rough patch at the moment and she threw this in my face during an argument. I don't think I'm the asshole necessarily but I want to get some other perspectives.

A while back my girlfriend's friend paid off her student loans and decided to celebrate by taking one month of loan payments' worth of money and treating some friends out to dinner. There were 6 of us, including her. The most important thing to understand here is that when we all sat down, she told us the money was specifically set aside for this dinner, so please order whatever we wanted. She also ordered several appetizers for the table and said she would pay for up to 2 alcoholic drinks per person. The restaurant was a midrange steakhouse.

When it got to me I ordered the ribeye which was NOT the most expensive item on the menu. From previous conversations with my girlfriend I knew that the friend's monthly loan payment was $500, so she had that amount set aside for the dinner. 500 ÷ 6 ≈ 83 so with 6 people, everyone could spend up to $83 without going over the amount set aside for the dinner. I did some quick mental math on what everyone had ordered and we were still well below that threshold, so I felt comfortable adding a lobster tail to my meal. Very important note: My entrees did not exceed $83.

No one said anything about it, but my girlfriend lit into me when we got home and said I embarrassed her and that I took advantage of her friend. I told her that her friend had said to get whatever we wanted and I explained to her that the math worked out so it was okay.

My girlfriend's argument is that ""get whatever you want"" doesn't mean a second entree and that I should have gotten the surf and turf if I wanted lobster. My belief is that ""get whatever you want"" means exactly that, that I did my due diligence in making sure the cost wouldn't go over the amount she had set aside, and that the friend had set aside that money specifically for the dinner so she wasn't expecting to have any of it left.

When we were younger, our mom had this rule that every morning and before we went to bed, we should give each other a hug. I asked my mom about it when I got older, and she said her parents had a similar rule and she thought it made her and her siblings closer. 

Eventually, around the time I went to college, Paul and I stopped hugging every day because I found it pretty awkward. However, up until now, I would hug Abby (whenever we were together anyway). Paul does the same. 

Currently, all of us live together. Last night, my girlfriend (35F) was staying over, and we were sitting on the couch. Abby said she was going to bed, so I gave her a hug. After my she went inside, my GF said that it was really weird and that I was babying Abby. She told me I shouldn’t hug Abby anymore. 

This morning, when Abby tried to hug me, I told her she shouldn’t anymore, because she’s grown up now and it’s kind of weird. Abby just said okay, then left. She didn’t really talk to me for the rest of the day. It’s been pretty awkward, because all of us are home all the time, since her school and our work is all online. 

Paul later came up to me and said I was being a dick. I told him it was my GF who told me not to hug Abby, and he said that it was stupid she was jealous of a kid, and she was being creepy.

127,YTA,AITA for telling my daughter that she threw away all her hard work when she ate a cookie after a run?,"My daughter (17) has lost a significant amount of weight and gotten quite fit in the past year by running, lifting weights, and eating healthy. I truly don’t care about this — as long as there’s no unhealthy relationship with food, I could not care less about how she looks. 

I have, however, always taught her not to be wasteful. She’s been running longer and longer distances, and I’m proud of her. For thanksgiving, I baked a big batch of cookies today and told my husband and kids they could have some today if they wanted. She got hole from her run as I was taking a fresh batch out of the oven, and she sat down and ate one. 

I asked her how her run was, and she said it was good and that she’d run 5 miles in 45 minutes. I was impressed, especially since she had lifted weights this morning, and said “are you sure you wanna throw away all your hard work with that cookie?” She asked what I meant, and I said that I’m not judging, just asking if she really wants to undo her run. 

She said “well, it sure sounded like a judgement. A cookie isn’t gonna ‘undo my run’, and I’d appreciate you not commenting on what I eat”. She went upstairs after that, and I just don’t understand her reaction. I was just concerned about her, because I feel like she wasted a lot of effort just to have a cookie afterwards.

128,YTA,AITA for giving my daughter the larger room when her stepsisters share a room?,"When I first moved out of my parents' house into my own apartment, I bought myself a decent queen-sized bedroom set. Wooden bed frame with headboard, dresser, two night stands, a storage ottoman, a vanity table, and a bookcase. I bought decent quality stuff so that it would last, and it has. When I moved in with my now husband, we had to get a larger bed anyway and he wanted ""fresh"" stuff, so there was the question of what to do with my furniture. 

My daughter was turning 4 and was starting to grow out of her crib/toddler bed anyway, so I arranged it in what would be her room, and moved her out of her crib to that. There was only one room aside from the master that would fit the set, so she ended up with the larger of the two other upstairs bedrooms. My husband's two older daughters would be sharing a room, and the even smaller bedroom off of the finished basement would be a guestroom/office.

Since the 3rd upstairs room is smaller, we have bunkbeds in there to save space. The girls have now seen that my daughter not only has a bigger room but has ""grown-up"" furniture and they and their mother are launching accusations of favoritism. This just isn't true. 

They are adamant that we should at the very least be putting her in a twin sized bed instead of having one child be a ""literal queen"" with a larger bed or even throw out an entire set of furniture to move her into the smaller room and have the two older girls share the larger room. That's so expensive and wasteful, and I just don't see the point.

1. They're only here 50% of the time. I don't see the point of dedicating the larger bedroom or two separate bedrooms to kids who are only here half of the time. 

2. This furniture wasn't bought specifically for her, and this is the only bedroom it would fit in with space to walk around. It literally has to go in this room or be thrown away. 

3. While it is more ""adult"" she will be able to grow into it instead of us constantly having to update furniture as she grows out of it. The furniture is also less than 7 years old, so throwing it away would be wasteful. 

Am I just seeing this wrong? My daughter's father (the only other person IRL this has been discussed with yet) and I were both only children, but even still throwing away perfectly fine furniture because of perception would just not happen. It's just a bedroom set.",2020-11-25 11:42:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k0qpcp/aita_for_giving_my_daughter_the_larger_room_when/,1208,3047,0.92,7
129,YTA,AITA for wanting to talk to the woman responsible for my parents divorce?,"When I was 10 my parents divorced. It was very messy. I didn't know at the time but they had a real Charles-Diana-Camilla thing going on and after years of watching my dad love another woman my mother finally cracked and divorced him. It was acrimonious and it did a lot of damage to me that I'm working out in therapy.

My father married his mistress 30 days after the divorce between he and mom was made final. Ultimately ""Angie"" couldn't handle things (my parent's friends and my mom bad-mouthed her in our small town, I was a little shit head, my dad's parents and family were awful to her, she was put through the wringer) and the marriage fell apart after 2 years. I never saw her after that. My dad never really moved on from Angie, turns out he really loved her. 

I'm now in my 20's and my therapist suggested I talk to the people in my life connected to the divorce. My father was happy to talk, mom was reticent. I found Angie, she lives a town over. I sent her a message on FB asking to speak. She declined me. I sent another messaging in greater detail explaining why I wanted to speak and that I hold nothing against her any longer, that I'm just looking for closure and I think she could be helpful.

Once again Angie declined to speak to me. She told me she had managed to move on and she wasn't interested in rehashing the past. I told her talking to me was the least she could do to help me move on since she was partially the cause of my childhood trauma.

Angie blocked me. As a last-ditch effort I went to her house (she's in the phone book, her address is public). Angie wouldn't answer the door and threatened to call the cops if I didn't leave her alone.

I don't understand why she won't talk to me. I'm just asking her for a little help, a little clarity. She was instrumental in the downfall of my parents marriage and the catalyst for an incredibly bad divorce. I feel like she owes me a little, just a little.

AITA for trying to talk to Angie?

130,YTA,AITA for being honest with my wife that I'm disappointed in her for choosing not to breastfeed our baby?,"My wife Anne and I had a wonderful baby girl a few weeks ago. During the pregnancy I tried to be as supportive to Anne as I could, as I knew it was rough on her, but I’ll admit it was hard for me to hold my tongue at how much junk food she was eating. Of course if she'd had HG or issues like that, she'd to eat whatever she could keep down, but she didn't, and even her mom and doctor were pressing her to eat more fruits and vegetables. I expressed my opinion once, and when it wasn’t well received, I dropped it, but my point here is that Anne has been making a sub-par effort (in my mind) for our daughter’s nutrition from the get-go.

After the birth, Anne started breastfeeding, but stopped quickly as she found it “agonizing”. The doctor and lactation specialist confirmed there was no physical issue with her or the baby, and no reason for it to be painful at all. She and Anne’s mom explained that it’s normal for it to feel uncomfortable at first, but she needed to keep at it and would get used to the feeling. She gave it a few more attempts and gave up, because it was “excruciating” and she said it was keeping her from bonding with the baby. Again, I wanted to support Anne as much as I could, and explained that a problem bonding with the baby was PPD and something we could get her treatment for, but that it was important she keep at it. In the hospital, we had the support of the lactation specialists and my mother in law, but once we were at home with the baby, Anne refused to keep with the breastfeeding and made the decision to switch our daughter to formula.

I know that this isn’t a hill worth dying on, so I said nothing, but honestly it does really bother me that she put her own temporary comfort above our daughter’s long-term health. Breastfeeding is shown to decrease the risk of a whole host of issues, and now that our daughter has her first cold, it’s hard for me not to feel resentful to Anne for putting her in this situation. While this cold may not have been avoided through breastfeeding, it’s a proven fact that breastfed children have stronger immune systems, so eventually there will be an illness that my daughter comes down with because her mother wasn’t committed enough to breastfeed. If Anne had had some sort of medical problem that made it difficult for her, I would completely understand and support using formula. But she doesn’t, she just didn’t feel like it, and it’s hard for me to read that as anything other than selfishness. I would walk through fire for our daughter, and I’m perplexed that Anne’s parental instinct didn’t come through in this instance. 

Anne has clearly sensed the resentment on my part and brought this up directly. I was honest with her that I’m frustrated and disappointed with her decision, but that since it’s of course her body it’s not my place to say any more. She said nothing and has refused to speak to me for three days, other than to discuss necessary aspects of our daughter’s care.

131,YTA,AITA for selling my daughter’s iPad?,"In March 2018, my daughter, 16, bought an iPad. She bought it from her own Christmas money. She is a wonderful artist, but I believe she is limiting her potential.

She has made money from it, as a little over a month ago she was requested work on Instagram. She has a substantial amount of followers on it, 10k, and has made just under £100. It’s nice that she’s doing this- but it is making me worry. She does well in school, but all she is doing at the minute is drawing.

I understand, she has a hobby and people are paying her money. It is good, but I don’t like what she draws either. It is not explicit in any sense, but I don’t believe she is pushing herself. She has so much talent. And because she is drawing so much recently, she is neglecting her duties such as doing homework. 

I’ve tried getting it across to her that school is important. I came out with good grades and now I am an accountant. I worked hard at school, by doing my homework the first day I got it. I went to many extra curriculars and I was a star student. If I could do it 30 years ago, she can do it now. 

I have a rule of no technology until after dinner, but recently I’ve found out she’s been using her iPad before dinner. I took her iPad away from her and told her she knew the rules. Before dinner is for homework only, but she complained because we have dinner at 7:00-7:30pm and she goes to bed at 9:30, which doesn’t give her enough time for her to make art for her customers since she also has to shower. 

It seems that everything has been revolving around her iPad and I’ve had enough. On Friday, I had overtime at work. I left the key for her and told her to do her chores. I come home to see that she hadn’t done her work, and she came to me with a happy face. She had just been commissioned again and she was receiving £50 for it. I flipped. 

We had the biggest argument we’ve ever had. My daughter accused me of not supporting her. Which I do, but her education comes first and I’m sick and tired of her games. She cannot make a living from her art, and this social media thing is poisoning her. She knows the rules in my house, and she must stick to it. 

She retaliated that now she’s making money, I won’t need to nag at her like what I do. She finally has a good job- and she’s making more money from this than what she did on her paper round. She can put this money towards her college fund. I took her iPad and flat out told her “I am selling it.” She is to delete her Instagram, and refund that new customer. 

She’s been crying and wailing, accusing me of not loving her and twisting my words. She’s told the story to her Auntie and I now have her berating me too. Nobody seems to understand that my daughter is obsessed with this iPad. Her excuse is that she’s making money, and I tell her there is no use making money now if you can’t make it in the future. AITA?

Edit: I have not yet sold the iPad. It is with me, however I had put it up Ebay this morning, before I posted on here. Some of you are seriously making me reconsider, but my decision still stands. I want what is best for my daughter, so that in ten years she can afford to draw all day, and comfortably lounge at home and make money.",2020-11-15 13:28:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/julvdb/aita_for_selling_my_daughters_ipad/,2733,2456,0.8,13
132,YTA,AITA for charging my late dads partner full market rent?,"My dad passed away a couple months ago and were sorting his estate out. I’m his only surviving child and was the sole inheritor. He was married to my mom a while ago but got divorced 20 years ago and had been with his new partner over 10 years. He never got remarried due to how bad he got screwed over in the divorce. That being said, he seemed to love her. 

His house is fully paid off and in a great area. He completed a bunch of renovations in the last year so I really lucked out with a totally modern, very nice paid off place that needs no work.

My wife doesn’t want to move into the new place because she doesn’t want to change our kids school, so we decided we’d rent the place out for passive income or security. 

We assumed his partner would want to move out but The issue is that his partner was not in the will so she didn’t get anything, since they’re not married. She is retired living on a small fixed income, which was fine while she was living with my dad and he paid for everything. She doesn’t feel ready to leave the place so we said if she wants to stay she can rent from us. We offered her the market rate for rent -maybe a little less and she freaked out. Said charging her at all, but especially the market rate, was cruel after the work she put into the house, I guess she planned the renovations (dad paid). 

My wife says by not doing whatever to maximize our income and put ourselves in the best position we’d be doing a disservice to our kids. I’m split morally  but going with my wife for our marriage’s sake. Does this make me the asshole to charge her full market rent?

Edit: my wife’s offer is to let her stay through December (3 months free) and then wants her out or paying rent. Not a year of reduce rent because her son has offered to take her in. 

-wife wants to reserve  rental profits to the kids college fund, something we’ve struggled to build thus far. 

-dads partner has an adult son and living brother, Son has offered to take her in. 

Final edit: no common-law or squatters rights here. they didn’t live there all 10 years, just the last 3, and she would NOT be homeless. She has an adult son she could live with

LAST UPDATE
This blew up overnight like I wasn’t expecting. She is in her 60s and seemingly healthy. We dont have a relationship. Her behavior was always somewhere between shy and antisocial (No way she would live with random roommates). My wife always thought she was rude because of this, and never really embraced our kids like her grandkids. Part of why she doesn’t feel the need to treat her like family when she has her own (son and brother). 

For everyone acting like we’re rich, I don’t know where in the post you got that. Our combined income is about 80k for a family of 4, considered lower end of middle class in our city. Market rate according to my friend who is a leading agent would be anywhere from 2.5k-3k a month. We offered her 2400 to be nice. This timelines works out that if we were to start collecting rent by this March, we’d have enough for each kid to go to college by the time they graduate high school. Then we could either keep it as a rents or sell it for our retirements. It would be life changing. 

The will was updated a total of 4 times by a very esteemed lawyer, most recently after the birth of my last son. It explicitly states that all of his possessions be left to me to provide for his grandkids. Every lawyer who has looked at it has said it is ironclad. There is no common law claim to be had. Knowing my dad, I think this was intentional to not amend the will to add her. He had expressed interest in helping pay for my kids college and He’d make dark jokes in the past about how if he’s learned anything it’s spoil your kids, not your woman. 

About 65% are saying YTA. I’m accepting the judgement that were assholes to the majority, but the NTAs made better points IMO.

This just happened yesterday, but I’ve (21 F) been seeing my boyfriend (28 M) for about a month and a half. 

He works at a pizza shop and left me in his apartment yesterday while he was working. Before the end of his shift, he messaged me asking what type of pizza I wanted him to get me.
 
I didn’t really have a preference, I’m not a picky eater, so I told him bring us back anything. He brought home pepperoni.

I’m jewish and I eat kosher. I’ve told him this before, and he’s seen me ordering at places asking for no bacon or making sure there’s no pork in the food. 

When I asked him why he would do that, he told me I said anything and that was what he wanted to eat tonight. He told me to order something else, or to pick off the pork. When I told him that’s not how being kosher works, he blew up at me and told me I was being picky and a dick.

edit: 
I’m seeing my bf tn and i’m going to apologize. you’re all right, the relationship is new and i might have picked a fight over something i should have reminded him over.

but to the people commenting and invalidating my level of kosher, please stop. there’s different sects of judaism, and different levels of kosher. ultra orthodox jews can’t eat at restaurants without a rabbi there, while some just follow basic guidelines. all types are valid, just bc i don’t have a rabbi blessing my food doesn’t make my kosher “faux”",2020-11-27 23:09:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k2btza/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_to_bring_back_any/,884,2584,0.91,0

I decided to just call her Lexa and when my brother’s girlfriend asked me why I never call her Celexa, I told her the truth - that it’s the name of a medication and now apparently I’ve got her upset because she’s worried that people are gonna bully their daughter.

135,YTA,"AITA for taking photos of my kids in ""anti-science"" t-shirts my dad sent them despite my wife forbidding it?","My dad is a good man which I think is important to note so people realize he isn't malicious in what he does, but he has some weird views and follows a lot of conspiracy theories. He's certainly in the camp of ""vaccines cause autism"" and ""chemtrails."" Many of us have talked to him about those things over the years but he just refuses to change his mind, so we've more or less accepted that he's always going to think this way and mostly try to avoid any triggers that will lead to a discussion of those types of things. 

My wife, who is a science teacher, has always disagreed with our approach. Not going to get into her views as to why but we've more or less agreed to disagree. It's essentially a kind of neutrality agreement. 

My dad kind of upset this balance recently when he sent our kids some shirts that promote some of his anti-science conspiracy theories. That made it hard to ignore him and his views. I tried to acknowledge the gift and thank him for it, but that wasn't enough. He wanted pictures of our kids in them. I tried to promise without promising with the hope that he'd forget it, but he didn't and kept asking for them, which started turning into him questioning my views and if me and my wife had started believing the ""lies.""

At that point the path or least resistance seemed to be to just take the photos and leave it at that. We'll see him for Thanksgiving in a couple of weeks so doing this now will make that day more pleasant for us all. Not just me but my mom, wife and siblings. 

My wife had seen the shirts and said under no circumstances would she allow pictures of our kids to be taken in them even though I told her this would be the best way to avoid any issues. I finally decided to take the photos and send them to my dad. That would have been fine if he didn't post them on Facebook for our whole family to see...

When my wife saw them she was angry. Really, really angry. By far the angriest I've ever seen her to the point where it was a little scary. She said that I was an asshole for doing this without discussing it with her knowing her feelings. I can see her point, but by doing this I am making life more pleasant for all of us. I also don't really need her permission since they are my kids too. She may not like it but ultimately she doesn't hold a monopoly on what the kids wear.

136,YTA,AITA for hiding baby food from my girlfriend,"My girlfriend was getting ready to feed our 6 month old son, and put the food down to run to the bathroom.

When she went to the bathroom to see if she set it down in there, I pulled it out of the cabinet and put it on the counter.

My girlfriend came back in and looked around again, and must’ve missed it on the counter. I pointed it out and she said “what I swore I looked in here already”. She kept asking if I moved it and I kept saying no. She sat down and started feeding our son and randomly started crying, saying how mentally exhausted she was.

137,YTA,AITA for telling my stepbrother that he's the reason I'm a laughing stock among my friends?,"My stepbrother Alex,17 (fake name) and I have never been extremely close (m18 here). My dad married Alex's mum when I was 14 and Alex had just turned 13. We're civil to each other and even joke around sometimes but we'd both rather hang about with our own friend groups.

Here's the thing, Alex has always been EXTREMELY flamboyant. Like to the point where it was a surprise to no one when he came out as he was such a walking gay stereotype. I have no issues with him or his boyfriend but the way he acts and talks, and sometimes even the way he dresses, is really annoying. I can say it's not a phase as he's been that way since I met him but it doesn't make it any less frustrating. I even thought he was genderqueeer or something for a while. He used to have pretty long hair, which he's ditched for the minute, and is not opposed to wearing crop tops. It's embarrassing. I actually cringe for him sometimes, he was mistaken for a girl so many times when he had long hair and it never bothered him. Whereas I'd be kinda humiliated if someone thought I was a girl.

So, the last time I had friends over, pre covid, they thought it was pretty amusing when we walked in on Alex dancing around the living room, in a crop top, with our little sister Jess (she's 6). They were blaring lady gaga or beyonce or some crap and my friends thought it was absolutely hilarious. They teased me about it for ages, they still bring it up now. I was very self conscious about having friends over after that.

A friend of mine recently had a fall out with his parents and has been essentially kicked out. My dad and his wife said that he can stay here if need be as we have a sofa bed but I was really hesitant. I know for a fact that my friend will take the absolute piss after staying here for a couple weeks and he'll tell all of my other friends about my weird step brother. Alex asked me several times why I was so hesitant and made out like I didn't want to help my friend. He seemed to be talking down to me like a child so I snapped at him. I told him that he makes me a laughing stock amongst my friends. They humiliate me for having anything to do with him.

He was a bit taken aback by me snapping at him and left the room, I later found out he'd been crying. My dad gave me an awful lecture about ""how I treat Alex"" but I think I was just stressed out and the words just came out. I wish I hadn't said them and I would take them back in a heartbeat if I could but I can't. Plus, I think Alex was a bit overdramatic after the fact. AITA here?

(edit)

Right I get it, you all think I'm a complete AH. But I want to clear things up now.

I. Am. Not. A. Homophobe. 

I have no issue with Alex being gay. I have no issues with his boyfriend. Hell I've walked in on them before (when they thought everyone was out) and just apologised and left the room. I know Alex would do the same if it were me and my girlfriend. That does not bother me in the slightest. 

What does bother me is coming home to one of Alex and Jess' little dance parties in the living room. Having to see them dancing around and singing Bad Romance or whatever. It is great that he;s bonding with Jess, he's always been good with her but it's just cringe worthy to watch. And my friends notice that it's cringe worthy. They thought it was hilarious when our new maths teacher mistook Alex for a girl in the middle of class. Alex just made it worse by making a joke about how he was my sister. My friends think it's brilliant, I think it's humiliating. 

I'm not a homophobic person. I just want Alex to stop trying to humiliate me in front of my friends. 

Also to the people saying things like ""get new friends"" and ""Alex is your brother"". No. He is my step brother. He and I did not grow up together, we moved into the same house a few years ago because my dad married his mum. My friends and I have been friends since primary school. They are like brothers to me. I do care about Alex and will apologise for snapping at him and making him cry but I am not going to lose friends over him.",2020-11-27 00:54:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k1r89f/aita_for_telling_my_stepbrother_that_hes_the/,1002,1620,0.84,4
138,YTA,AITA for telling our server she had a beautiful scalp at my wife’s birthday dinner?,"This happened before the coronavirus was a thing in case you’re wondering. Obviously right now we’re staying in as much as possible and supporting local business through take out and delivery. 

So this was over a year ago and my wife won’t let it go. I’m looking for some external input. I took my wife to our favorite local spot for her birthday. Everything was good as usual, but we had a server neither of us had seen before with a somewhat striking appearance: she was completely bald. Normally I wouldn’t say anything about something like that because I’m afraid of being rude, but toward the end of the dinner the server made a joke about she and I having the same haircut (I’m bald). 

I said something along the lines of, “I don’t mean to be rude, but I’m curious. Are you bald by choice?” It turns out she was, which was a great relief to me since I didn’t want to pry into it if she was sick or involuntary bald for some reason. She was more than happy to talk about it and told me all about how she’d always loved bald heads and wanted to try it. She said she got positive feedback and just kept her head shaved. I told her I loved that and I thought women could look very beautiful bald even though it’s not something you see often. I told her she had a great head shape for it and joked about offering razor recommendations. It was light conversation and that was the end of it.

For the rest of the meal my wife was silent. I could tell something was wrong. When we got to the car, there was a moment of pause between us and I asked if something was wrong. She replied, “Are we going to stop at Walgreens and pick up some clippers?” I asked her what she meant and she said obviously since I was enthralled with our server’s shaved head she had to do something to win her husbands attention back. I was “blatantly” flirting with our server, apparently. It spiraled into a huge fight with my wife accusing me of wanting to experiment with an exotic-looking woman because I was tired of my boring old wife.

I can’t deny that in the moment, I probably looked like I was flirting with our server. It was not intentional, but I guess I realize how it could’ve seemed inappropriate at my wife’s birthday dinner. I did find her attractive, but my wife will always come first. I’m attracted to her and I love her. That’s why I married her. Even now she makes little references like “I guess I’m not as interesting as a bald goddess” or “Does this look good on me or do I need to show some scalp?”

So am I the asshole for this? I just want things to be okay. I’ve tried apologizing but nothing will stop it.

EDIT: I’m starting to see people making comments that seem to indicate it is never okay to talk about balding in public. I reject this completely. I did not bring this up out of nowhere; the topic came up when the server pointed out (in a jovial fashion) that she and I had the same haircut. It was a brief conversation with zero negative or uncomfortable vibes, and when we left I said bye to the server and she pointed at her head and gave me a little thumbs up. I get the feeling we would’ve got along well as friends. So this isn’t the issue.

EDIT 2: Good grief you guys, let me clear something up. My wife is 25 and I am 24. The server looked older than both of us, probably early 30s. So anything saying in flirting with a younger woman is wrong. Also my wife suggested I don’t find her attractive anymore which is completely wrong. Why would I marry someone I didn’t think was capital H O T?? She’s plenty attractive.

I’m reading everything you’re sending and it’s split down the middle as far as I can tell. All I can tell you is please read carefully. No one was trapped in a conversation with me they didn’t want. As I said the server got my attention as we were leaving. Do you get the attention of people you’re glad are almost out the door? Also I don’t remember the conversation down to the last detail but it was maybe a minute tops. Hope this gives things a little more clarity.

EDIT 3: Lmao yall I see my post got tagged. I don’t know if that means they counted or what but I guess what I’ll do is apologize to my wife in a more formal way and see if she’ll tell me why she’s been bringing this up over and over. She doesn’t even seem mad anymore really, it’s just coming up every time she talks to me it seems like. And I never addressed it but I already apologized sincerely right after this happened last year. And again numerous times. I don’t know how I can do it any better.

Also yall are ridiculous! I got two messages saying I should get divorced by her immediately and one person said it was evidence of some kind of crime and I should be in jail! Yall I can’t with that one, but thanks to everyone who gave me reasonable input. I guess when this many people see a post I’m gonna get a few unhinged people. I will make a update if I ever get to a solution if this sub is okay with that.",2020-11-24 15:24:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k06zdp/aita_for_telling_our_server_she_had_a_beautiful/,848,2680,0.93,6
139,YTA,AITA for preferring to watch a movie with my younger daughter instead of my older?,"My oldest daughter (23F) has been moping around the house for the past 8 months. She finished her masters in June and had gotten a job in her field, but that offer got cancelled because of covid in March so she had to move back home. She then got another job in the summer but lost it after 2 months because the company (a start-up) went bankrupt. So she's been working full-time at the grocery store and moping around my house being all depressed in the spare time. She keeps talking about how ""screwed"" her generation is, how it's the worst year of her life and how the world is ""on fire"" and it's getting exhausting. This month is even worse because her boyfriend broke up with her. She didn't tell me why, but I'm assuming its because he's also tired of her complaining all the time. To be clear, I am a supportive dad, I paid for her masters, but I do not appreciate negative energy in my house and want to live in a positive and optimistic environment, so we've had some clashes. 

By contrast, my younger daughter (14F) is a positive and optimistic kid who's been making the best of the bad situation. She looks for positives in everything and doesn't mind the hybrid in person/online schooling. Its no secret then that I prefer to spend time with her instead of my older daughter. 

For the past week, my older daughter has been suggesting we watch the movie Contagion for family movie night. She's been asking every day but my wife and I have been busy. Last night, we finally decided to watch but my younger daughter said the movie doesn't look 'interesting' to her and she won't watch it with us. She wanted to watch 12 Monkeys instead. I told my older daughter that we should watch 12 Monkeys then so everyone can watch together, but she got offended and said she won't watch it with us. I said that's fine by me, I'd rather spend time with her sister anyways because she's not a sad draining mop. Maybe kinda mean, but after 8 months of the hell of having her in my house it just spilled over. 

She was crying for the rest of the night in her room and my wife still won't speak to me for 'alienating' her. Again, I am supportive, I paid for her schooling and I keep telling her she just needs to chin up and accept the situation and look for the positives. I just prefer to spend my time with the kid who doesn't drain my energy like a vampire.

140,YTA,AITA for inviting my sisters ex to my wedding and not her,"I’m getting married to my Fiancé Brad whenever things get less hectic. We have everything planned out including who’s coming which has been very controversial. My sister Leah used to date Brads older brother Mike. She broke up with him because Mike cheated on her. Mike became a bit of a stalker and did things and she got a restraining order against him. I was angry at Mike, BUT when I went to university his brother was in my class and we fell in love.

Anyways when we were discussing who should come my fiancé said he wanted his brother. Brad said it’s because he’s very close with Mike and also Mike saved his life. Brad wants Mike to be there to see him progress even further in life. Brad teared up a bit (he isn’t an emotional guy) and said he’s sorry but he’s choosing Mike over Leah.

I’m very close with Leah, but Brad is my future husband so he kind of takes priority. I told Leah the bad news (thinking she would understand because she’s still going dress shopping with me) and she said I was no longer welcome in her home or to see my niece.

141,YTA,AITA for paying for my younger daughter's wedding dress and not my older daughter's dress?,"I have 3 grown children (son, daughter, daughter). I don't have enough money to give them all $50K for a wedding. So I told them that I can give them $3K each and help with any DIY projects. 

When my son got married three years ago, his wife was such a sweetheart and invited me to go dress shopping with her family. I was happy to go and enjoyed the time. My daughter-in-law found her dream dress and then we looked at veils. She was going back and forth between two veils that were both over budget. I had one that I preferred so I offered to pay for it as a gift if she chose it. My daughter-in-law was happy to get the $400 cathedral veil for free and I was happy to give it to her. My son's mother-in-law thanked me for my generosity and I said it was my pleasure. This was a great way for me to have some input on the wedding in a way that benefits everyone.

Two years ago was my older daughter's wedding. I gave her & her husband $3K and spent an afternoon working on invitations with her. When we all went dress shopping (both daughters, myself, my mom) my daughter was indecisive but I really loved one specific dress. It was $2300 and gorgeous/timeless. I told my daughter that I would pay for half the dress if she chose it. My daughter was very tempted but she went with a different dress. She asked ""So mom, let's go splitsies?"" and I said no. 

The 50/50 offer was for one specific dress that she did not chose, she got upset and said I was trying to manipulate her. Except I hadn't pressured her at all, I made my offer only once! I accepted that she wanted another dress which is completely understandable. But the offer was specifically for this one dress. My daughter was upset and claimed that it was unfair and if I have the money I should give it to her. The whole thing was embarrassing coming from a nearly 30 year old adult woman who was about to be a married woman. It was a sensitive topic for a while but everything blew over before the wedding.

And now my youngest child is engaged for a late 2021 wedding. We went dress shopping just a few days ago. She asked all of us there to pick out a dress for her to try. I fell in LOVE with a dress that was a bit more princess-y than my daughter originally had in mind but I made the same offer as I did to my older daughter: I'll pay for half of THIS dress. After trying on a whole bunch of dresses, my youngest daughter asked us all what we thought and I reiterated my original offer: I'll pay for half of THAT dress. The prospect of a 1/2 off dress was good enough for her to take it. So she bought the dress that I had picked out for her & I paid for half of it. 

My older daughter was VERY upset. She said it's unfair and that is manipulative. Except I didn't bring it up constantly to either of them, I just made a simple offer and gave them the option to take it up. But now we're in a situation where both sisters are upset with each other and my daughter is upset with me.",2020-11-22 05:16:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jyq6fo/aita_for_paying_for_my_younger_daughters_wedding/,956,2817,0.87,2

143,YTA,AITA for needing my daughter to help?,"I (62) lost my wife ten years ago. This happened during that time, but has been brought up recently.

When my wife died, I ended up relying heavily on my oldest, who was 16 and I’ll call Nancy. She gave up the most, I’ll admit that, because I needed someone to watch the younger boys while I worked. She could no longer be part of her soccer team, or her art program, I needed her home. During her senior year she told me going to prom was very important to her and to please figure something out so she could go. I said I would, but ended up forgetting about it and worked late. I got home to find her crying in her dress. I was tired and didn’t want to get into it, and told her I was sorry, but it wasn’t like she missed anything important. Nancy didn’t talk to me for days after that. When her college letters started coming in, I didn’t think much of it and assumed she’d pick a college close to hone. Well, she ended up getting a partial scholarship to a school several hours away.

I was pretty upset because I still needed help, but she said she gave up two years of doing anything for herself to take care of her brothers and she wasn’t a replacement mom, and I used her. I said she was being dramatic and she couldn’t abandon her family, what were we supposed to do? She said I should be a parent and figure it out. There was a big fight but she left anyhow, I don’t have much contact with her now.

My oldest son is a senior this year, and he was FaceTiming Nancy saying there wouldn’t be a prom and how he understood but he was disappointed because he really wanted to take his girlfriend. Nancy said she understood because she didn’t get to go to her senior prom either. He said he was sorry, but she said it wasn’t his fault he was just a kid, and that I didn’t come home when I was supposed to so she missed it. I came in and said it was pretty pathetic she was still hung up on that, and she snapped back it was far more pathetic to be so inept as a parent I couldn’t handle giving her one night that I knew was important to her. She then said goodbye to her brother and signed off. My son said I’m an asshole and that it was no surprise Nancy wanted nothing to do with me. I got angry and grounded him, but he just laughed. I don’t think it was at all appropriate for her to tell him that, but my son maintains I’m the only asshole here.

144,YTA,AITA for roasting a guy who said it’s okay to cry?,"So I’ve never been a crier. It’s just not my personality. When I’m faced with a problem, my immediate instinct is ‘how do I solve this’. As in I’m completely focused on remedying the issue. I just don’t feel too many negative emotions when I’m faced with problems. I get a bad grade on a test? I’ll convince the teacher to let me retake. My parents yell at me? I’ll get them back on my good side. You get the idea. And so, I can’t remember the last time I’ve cried when faced with a a problem.

Anyhow, yesterday I got dumped and told my friends about it. Honestly, it’s no biggie. I’m mostly sure I can win her back, and even if I don’t, it’s not a big deal. I’ll move on, plenty of fish in the sea. Don’t get me wrong, I like her, otherwise I wouldn’t be trying to get her back, but she’s not unique.

Anyhow, I was hanging out with some people today, and they were just checking up on me. I assured them I was fine. They asked what I was going to do, and I told them since I had the ACT soon, I would go joke, do some practice problems, get a workout in, and then maybe start coming up with a plan to get her back.

One of them, let’s call him Jack, said that it was okay to sit down and grieve and be sad. I told him I don’t really feel grief, I just want to be productive and fix the issue if I can. I explained that I don’t really cry, and he didn’t seem to believe me and kept trying to hound me about it.

So I got annoyed and told him, ‘look, maybe you sit around crying all day whenever something doesn’t go your way, but that’s not me. I just go and fix the problem, and if I can’t, so be it.’

This pissed him off because he was ‘just trying to help’. I don’t like he wouldn’t back off after repeatedly being told to.

145,YTA,AITA for not wanting to call my 2nd grader’s teacher “Dr. Smith”?,"Update: OK, I'm found to be the asshole and I'm OK with that. In fact, I had a chance to address her this morning, and I called her Dr. Smith the way she had respectfully asked me to twice. I can see that I wasn't being respectful and yes, a bit of a petulant child. I will say that it was interesting that most of the NTA's were also PhDs people who worked with them. I had a similar experience so now I can see where my confusion was in the cultural aspect of it. Thanks people of Reddit for weighing in and for (mostly) keeping it civil.

I have a son in 2nd grade who is in a public school in the US that is in fully remote. During the first week of school, I listened in on class. My son’s teacher, whom had signed the only email we had from her as Dr. Sarah Smith\*, told the kids, “My name is Dr. Sarah Smith, but you don’t need to call me “Dr.” because I know that can be confusing because I’m not a medical doctor, so you can just call me Sarah, Ms. Sarah or Ms. Smith (our school’s norm is calling teachers and staff by their first name).” I filed this info away for my own self, and went on with my day.

A few days later, all the teachers met with families to get to know each other. My son’s teacher came into the call and introduced herself as Dr. Sarah Smith. She was quite the talker and spent a lot of time talking about her background and credentials, but seemed pleasant and excited about her job. Near the end, I asked, “Ms. Sarah, can we still access the school library?” and she said, “Actually, it’s Dr. Smith. ...”

I was taken aback because I had recalled her telling my son’s class they could call her Ms. Sarah. I couldn’t figure out how to respond and felt rushed, so I quickly apologized for getting her name wrong and we signed off.

Meanwhile, as I’ve been helping my son with his work, I’ve been noticing how she signs her messages to students with “Ms. Sarah” and “Dr. Sarah Smith” with the parents. In the classes, the students were calling her both Sarah and Ms. Sarah. I was confused.

Fast forward to this week when we had our second parent/teacher meeting. Once again, my son’s teacher jumped headlong into our meeting without much greeting and spent most of the time talking. When I finally had the chance to speak, I once again addressed her as “Ms. Sarah” and she once again corrected me saying “actually, it’s Dr. Smith.” So I said, “I’m glad this came up because I’ve overheard you say to the students they can call you Ms. Sarah and my son refers to you as that at home so that’s where my confusion is coming from.” She replied, “With parents, I prefer to be called Dr. Smith.” And then she steamrolled on until it was time to go.

Now I feel certain she’s just power tripping here. I don’t want to feed her ego, nor continue creating confusion in our house when my kid talks about his teacher Ms. Sarah and I’m talking to him about Dr. Smith. Yes, I’m an asshole for thinking “Is the ‘Dr.’ really warranted here? We are just dealing with teaching a bunch of 8 year olds how to capitalize proper nouns and what division is” but I get there was likely more to her degree than that, and I can put that all aside when it comes to being respectful and honoring people’s wishes. However, all of this had made me feel like just referring to her generally from here on out.

So folks, am I missing out on some cultural norm here? Am I the asshole here for not wanting to call her Dr. Smith and feeling like she’s being egotistical?",2020-11-07 01:20:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jphrjn/aita_for_not_wanting_to_call_my_2nd_graders/,1841,4796,0.89,4
146,YTA,AITA for not catering to my daughter's food intolerance,"At the beginning of last year my daughter (19F) started having bad reactions after consuming onion. She became physically sick about four or five times and she theorized that it was the onion making her ill so she has avoided it ever since. When I make dinner I don't cater for her self diagnosed onion intolerance because it's inconvenient. I told her she should just cook her own dinner or perhaps see a doctor if she truly thinks she's allergic to onion which got her angry. She also has a history of hypochondria so I wouldn't be surprised if she's just convinced herself of this intolerance. 

It doesn't make sense to me that she's fine eating meals with chopped onion such as spaghetti but as soon as it's fried onion she says she can't eat it. My daughter has recently started complaining about feeling unwell after eating large amounts of garlic or garlic bread. I feel like her new food intolerances aren't very consistent.

147,YTA,AITA for having a breakdown after my sister's announcement?,"I have been struggling to conceive for the past 9 years. It has been a very brutal journey for me and my husband. We have experienced many disappointments. 

My sister is also happily married and they adopted 2 teenagers (who are also siblings). I have stopped going to my sister for any emotional support as her advise has always been ""Just adopt"". I know that she thinks that the fact that I want to spend so much money on fertility treatments instead of adopting is stupid. In the past few years, I haven't spoken to my sister because my life revolved around the treatments and I didn't have any time for her negativity. 

This whole experience changed a lot of things in my life. Everything is sometimes heart breaking and I get irrationally emotional. I am pro choice and I know that in my brain but when someone mentions that they had abortion, I immediately see red. I usually remove myself from the situation and I feel very bad/guilty for even thinking some awful things about women. 

Recently we had a family dinner for our parents anniversary and she seemed a little off. My mom kept asking her what happened. At first, she wouldn't tell what happened. After dinner, me, mom and my sister were sitting in the living room while the guys and the kids were outside. My sister was grimacing and my mom again asked her what happened. She confided that she recently had an ""Oopsie"" and had to about. She said that she already had two kids and she doesn't want more. 

I froze. I had always assumed that my sister was also facing problems which is why she adopted. It felt like a punch to the gut to find out that wasn't the case. Worse, my mother was gushing and telling my sister how proud she was of her and that she was so brave. 

Something broke in me. I yelled. I screamed. I said some awful things. I said that her family wasn't real and she was an idiot for having an abortion. I told her that the fact that she would have an abortion for them was stupid. I told her that she wasn't even a woman because she couldn't appreciate the joys of pregnancy. I told her that she was going to regret doing this when they turn 18 and forget all about her. 

I stormed out after that and after having another breakdown in my own house, I felt guilty and ashamed. 

I called my sister and mother next day and told them I was sorry. Both of them were incredibly pissed at me, especially because the kids overheard me telling that they weren't her real kids. I have been informed that they were all going to cut contact with me. I have apologised and tried to explain my side of things and they aren't willing to listen.

Background- back in May my sister(26) found out her (27) husband who’s she’s been with for 7 years married 4 and has a child (1f) together was having an affair  with my best friend Kate(32) for  the last 2 years. it was a shock there were tears and tantrums for weeks when Kate and Tim told my sister about their relationship and he was filing for a divorce. My sister became very angry and bitter towards them both which I can understand 


But here’s the issue me and Kate have been best friends since we were 5 obviously I told Kate off about the affair and stopped taking to her but in July we made up and I saw how happy they were so I invited them to the wedding (me and my ex brother in law were close). 

I thought they’d put the differences aside for me for a single day because even tho my sister won’t admit it she has to be civil to them in the long run for her daughters sake 


Well Friday when Kate and my sister showed up for a fitting all hell broke lose. My sister called Kate a “nitty  prostitute” and asked me what kinda game I was playing, Kate was crying/apologising but sis just told to fuck off than left 


Since than my sister told me she and her daughter aren’t going to my wedding, most of my family have joined her calling me a bridezilla and an asshole even my in laws are mad 


So give it to me straight AITA for just wanting a perfect day were everyone puts their differences aside for me


I’m was asked to add this info-

Yes Kate knew my sister was gonna be there she wanted to talk to her and maybe try to mend things 


No my ex BIL didn’t know he chewed both of us out because my sis is 8 months pregnant and has already been making it difficult to see his daughter

149,YTA,AITA for cancelling dinner plans to celebrate with my daughter because my stepson was upset?,"My daughter (13) and stepson (11) have not gotten along since my daughter moved in.

She had previously lived with her mother but I got default custody after her mother turned one of her 24 hour disappearing acts into a never coming back one.

My daughter and stepson go to the same middle school and were both running for student council VP. 

There was tension in the house and my wife told my stepson that if he won we could go out to celebrate. My daughter asked if this applied to her as well since he wasn’t her only competitor and my wife said of course.

The campaign got pretty stressful for the both of them. Then the votes come in and my daughter wins by 4 votes.

However, because somehow the one person who ran for treasurer this year dropped out because of grades, my stepson was offered that position. 

He saw it as a really pitiful consolation prize and was angry that he had to take orders from my daughter.

I felt very bad for my stepson and he and his mother (who is also very Type A), was very upset, even though of course my wife congratulated my daughter.

My stepson refused to be comforted by the fact that older kids get more easily elected because they know more people and his mother even offered to take her to her law office and give him some responsibilities, saying that was better experience than student council would ever be. 

My stepson then said “ please tell me you’re not going to rub it in my face by taking us to dinner now.”

My wife also looks really reluctant to go to dinner. 

I finally tell my daughter that we weren’t going to be going to dinner because her stepbrother was very upset by the turn of events and we need to take his feelings into consideration. And that I was impolite to gloat.

150,YTA,AITA for sending my daughter to bed without dinner?,"***Update at the end of the post

Evelyn is 9, and she’s been testing boundaries lately. My husband and I do not spank, we do time outs, take away privileges, and talk things through. Lately she has begun saying rude, insulting things out of the blue. These comments range from critiques on clothing to criticisms of weight or other physical features. Absolutely rude statements that my husband and I would never say about anyone, ever. Whenever she has made these sorts of comments, we have had serious discussions with her about how inappropriate and hurtful they are, and we urge her to think before she speaks next time.

Tonight I got home from work early and decided to cook dinner and let my husband sleep in (he works nights and usually cooks dinner due to our schedules). I made beef stew from scratch. Nothing fancy, but we all enjoy it. I seasoned it as I always do, with salt, pepper, thyme, and a bay leaf. I felt good about cooking for my family, and didn’t even take the time to change out of my work scrubs  before I began. My husband woke up to the smell of stew cooking, and he was so happy about the surprise. Evelyn even said it smelled good. 

Then we began to eat. It was good, tasted just like always. My husband complimented it. Then Evelyn chimed in. “No offense Mom, but this stew is really bitter. Maybe next time only use half a bay leaf.” I stared at her for a good 10 seconds, my jaw on the floor. I had just worked a 12 hour shift at the hospital and come home to cook her dinner from scratch, only to have her insult my cooking. I honestly wasn’t sure how to react. I was hurt and angry, but I don’t like to raise my voice, and just talking to her about these statements in the past hasn’t changed her behavior. 

The thing is, if the stew really was bitter, I would have laughed about it, and told her that bay leaves don’t make things bitter, and maybe gone through possible ingredients that could have made it turn out that way. But the stew wasn’t bitter. My husband agrees, it tasted completely normal. I checked, and the bay leaf wasn’t in her bowl, it was still in the pot on the stove. She was just trying to come up with some way to insult me. So when I was finally able to respond, I quietly said, “If you don’t like the stew, you don’t have to eat it. Please take your bowl to the kitchen and get in the bath. You may eat breakfast in the morning.” 

Now she’s sobbing in her room about how unfair I am, and my husband thinks maybe I went too far. I was hoping that maybe the discomfort of going hungry for one night will remind her to watch her words in the future. What if she had said this to my elderly mother instead of me? What if she had said something cruel to one of her peers and destroyed their friendship? I don’t know how else to get through to her that words can cut deeper than any hunger pangs. Taking away the meal she insulted seemed like a fitting way to help her understand, but did I go too far? AITA?

Edit: thank you to everyone who has taken the time to respond and give me your perspective. Many people thought that I did the right thing, but most agree that I did not. I didn’t have enough characters available to explain in my original post that she did not “starve,” she has a stash of applesauce and granola bars in her room (she has a little tent and likes to pretend she is camping) but I see now that I should not have used food as a punishment. I will ask for her forgiveness when I get home today and try to have a talk with her about why she said what she did and how we can move forward together.

***Update: I had a long talk with Evelyn when I got home tonight. I told her I shouldn’t have sent her to bed without dinner, and I apologized and asked for her forgiveness. I asked her why she made her comment, if she really did taste something bitter in the stew? She started crying and said the stew wasn’t bitter. She said she wasn’t even sure what bitter tasted like (lol). I asked why she said it was bitter then?  She said she saw the bay leaf in the pot when she served herself, and she thought it would be funny to tell me it made the stew taste bad. She apologized for making it up. I asked if she wanted me to feel bad, and she said she didn’t know. After a very long and loving, gentle conversation, I think the real root of the problem is that she’s having trouble adjusting to my long hours while I’m working double shifts and finishing up school.

Moving forward I told her I’m going to try to give her the positive attention she needs before she feels like she has to resort to getting negative attention.

151,YTA,AITA for telling my youngest daughter that I cannot give her away at her wedding?,"Long backstory: I have 2 daughters, Anna (elder)and Carly (younger) who are a year apart. 

Carly and Anna were close when they were younger but drifted apart in their teenage years. I think she started resenting Carly because Carly always seemed to do well, academically and socially. 

Anna decided to take loans and go to a college she wasn't really a fan of. Carly got a full ride to Anna's dream college. Anna became very resentful after that. She was sure that Carly chose that college to rub it in Anna's face. 

I tried my best to accommodate them both. Anna refused to talk to Carly and didn't consent to any form of therapy. Carly refused to compromise as Anna kept being unreasonable. In the end, they both stopped talking to each other. Neither of them has ever asked me to choose between them. As long as I don't bring up the other or try to get them to reconcile, I have a good relationship with both of them. 

Now: Anna is a single mom with a 3 year old kid (Alex) who is always in between jobs and in debt. Me and my now-wife help out when we can, she recieves a bit of child support but I have to admit that she is struggling. Carly on the other hand, lives comfortably, has an incredible job and is living with her long term boyfriend. 

Recently Carly announced that her boyfriend proposes and that she wants to plan a wedding in 2022. She asked me to walk her down the isle and I may have cried a bit. 

However, Anna found out and then she came over to my house and had a breakdown (?) about how she always thought she would be the first to get married in the family and she has always wanted me to give her away first. I tried to console her but she ended up getting angry and told me that I should refuse to give away Carly or have a father/daughter dance with her at the wedding. At first, I refused but she then threatened to cut off all contact between her/Alex and us. [If Alex wasn't in the picture, I would have cut Anna off. As things stand, I need to consider Alex's well being].

Carly is staunchly childfree and it is very possible that Alex is going to be my only grandchild. Without my help, Alex's life is just going to be much more harder and I cannot abandon Alex with a good conscience. 

While I understood that Carly would be upset, Alex was a child and he is priority. 

I spoke to Carly, explained the situation. I told her that there was still time and I would figure out a way get Anna to change her mind. If not, I still promised her that I would still be very involved with her wedding except those 2 things. Carly just laughed and told me not to bother with her anymore and told me she wasn't going to invite me to her wedding. 

I definitely know that Anna is an asshole putting me in this position. But AITA for expecting Carly to be more understanding?",2020-11-05 15:12:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jokf37/aita_for_telling_my_youngest_daughter_that_i/,1378,6546,0.93,3

I was sure she'd gotten me something really good. Possibly a PS5, but I know there's a shortage. So I wasn't gonna get carried away.

So I wake up Sunday morning and walk downstairs and she hands me this envelope. I open it and it's a b&w sonogram. Don't get me wrong I'm happy that we're having a baby. Delighted. But this was **my day**, you know. No card, no cake. Just a print off. 

Like, if it wasn't my birthday she would have gotten a scan anyway. I told her I thought she was cheap and while I know I'm not entitled to a PS5, I do expect something decent!

153,YTA,AITA(28m) for not wanting to pay to stay in my girlfriends(26f) already paid off house?,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 3 years now. She’s been living at her parents house since she graduated from college at 21 despite having more than enough money to move out or move in with me as a software engineer. Her reasoning was she wanted to save up and invest all her money(and I mean literally all her money, she doesn’t have to pay for rent, groceries, utilities, anything) to buy this million dollar house next to the lake. 

Well who would’ve thought if you dumped 150k into the stock market every year it isn’t that hard to end up with well over a million dollars in a couple years. She bought the house without having to take out any loans and I finally thought we could move in together. Then she lets me know that I need to pay the $700 monthly hoa fee if I want to stay with her. She doesn’t even think it’s fair to split it since she put all her money into the house and I wouldn’t even be able to afford a house like this without her doing so. That she’s already paid more than “her fair share” and I should pick up the rest. She also said I already pay more than this for the apartment I share with roommate so it’s not like I can’t afford it. My girlfriend makes significantly more than me and my name isn’t even on the house so I don’t think it’s fair to make me pay anything, AITA?

154,YTA,AITA for saying I’m a better dad this time around? My daughter took it the wrong way.,"I was 28 and my ex wife was 27 when we had our daughter (26). Our son was born 3 years later. 

We were both young and saddled with financial problems. I was working 80+ hour weeks to climb the ladder and to at least make my expensive degree worth it.

My ex wife and I fought all the time because I felt pressured to marry after she got pregnant and I felt she could have worked more. 

Therefore, growing up my two older kids did have to experience me coming home at 10pm, missing award ceremonies, and cancelling vacation plans. 
I also find it crazy how I berated my kids for academic performance in a way I could never imagine doing so now. 

I fought with my ex wife about money and would sometimes return clothes she bought for the kids when I saw they came from department stores rather than stores with Target level affordability because I didn’t get why kids needed that. I also  took arguments into screaming matches and left in a very bad way. 

I admit I have a strained relationship that I’m now repairing with my kids. My daughter now comes over to the house I share with my new wife a couple times a month and sometimes stays over. 

My wife (28) just gave birth a year ago. I’m now in a high level position at my company so I can step out whenever and get myself days off so I like planning fun activities and surprising my wife with going shopping or date night. 

When my daughter is here, I invite her to come along if we’re doing something family stuff. Her attitude varies a lot but I let it go because she’s getting therapy and treats her one year old brother well. 

However, yesterday we all went shopping and my wife is in the process of remodeling our son’s room. My daughter kicked up an attitude when my wife wanted to go to the home section of Bloomingdale’s and pick out items. She also wanted to buy some new clothes. 

When my wife was out of earshot my daughter asked why she needed to buy kid stuff from an upscale department store and the baby wouldn’t remember the clothes ever. I had the same argument when I was younger but I learned that sometimes it doesn’t matter what I think works, and I’d rather just make my wife happy.

So I told her to stop bringing up the age old argument about upscale goods. Then I told her that I thought the same way as her in the past but I’ve learned a lot about compromise over the years. I then mentioned that I feel happy for a chance to do it right this time, and I’m a better dad this time around. And this was a new beginning, a second chance. 

She immediately teared up and said “ Congrats, guess you changed.” She wouldn’t accept my explanation that included being a better dad to her too and ended up Ubering back to her apartment.

AITA? This statement was meant to say I’ve done wrong and am doing better but she’s acting like I mortally insulted her in some way. She now refuses to respond to any form of outreach by me.",2020-11-16 14:52:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jv812w/aita_for_saying_im_a_better_dad_this_time_around/,920,3208,0.9,2
155,YTA,AITA for going to stay at my parent's cabin for a few days after my wife told me she was pregnant?,"I don't think I am but she does. 

This was a planned pregnancy, so it wasn't unexpected, but it's still big news. I'd already been experiencing a lot of anxiety about parenthood and have for some time (even some performance anxiety because of it), but when she told me she was pregnant it kicked into overdrive. I felt like I was going to have a panic attack, but more than that I felt like I just needed to get away - away from her and the situation and to have some time to think about it. 

I ended up going to stay at my parents' cabin for a few days, and I think it helped. When I came back I felt more relaxed and not as anxious. I also had time to really think about the pregnancy and come to terms with it. 

My wife now says that I shouldn't have gone and should have stayed at home to support her. She doesn't feel like what I did was fair since she also has fears and anxieties and she thinks prioritized my mental wellbeing over hers and the baby. I think that's an extreme reaction since I only was gone a few days, kept in constant contact with her, and came back in a much better state. I can understand why my reaction was probably not what she wanted, but she did tell me that she wouldn't object if I felt like I needed a few days to process things. 

What I did doesn't seem like something that would make me the asshole. I don't really think my wife is one either unless it would be for telling me it was okay to go away and then changing her mind. So I am here asking if anything that happened makes either of us the asshole.",2020-11-08 21:22:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jqjve4/aita_for_going_to_stay_at_my_parents_cabin_for_a/,1374,3713,0.9,4
156,YTA,"AITA For going out my bedroom window at 1AM during a storm to climb over to my neighbour's bedroom to fix his loudly banging window so I could sleep? He was not happy to see me hanging out there, silhouetted against the street lamp. Frankly he made quite an undignified fuss about it.","I'd assumed he was out because he'd not be able to sleep through the banging if I couldn't? Anyway, he saw me hanging at the window like Dracula and made such a frightful noise. You know when you're dreaming and you think you're shouting for help but you wake yourself up and the noise you are making is, ""nuraghrurARAAAGAHAH!"" It was like that. Pitiable, really. No sangfroid whatsoever. And vampires aren't even real.

Anyway, after the initial screaming I was able to explain my reason for hanging there, and he agreed that the window banging was a problem, but he blamed his landlord for not mending it! Which also, to me, showed a lack of gumption. As a renter I'd fix problems as they arose without bothering the landlord. I wouldn't just sit there in my room blubbing like Lucy Westenra as some helpful neighbour took matters into his own hands. It was an easy fix, too, I just wedged it shut with a load of blu tak. Which I never got back, actually. Also, it was quite a tricky climb. It's not a hobby I've ever gone in for. At one point I had my feet on something but my hands down near them pulling upwards to stay on the wall, which really didn't feel safe.

This happened years ago but another post on here about someone coming in to a house at night reminded me of it. I won't say it led to a rift between me and the neighbour, but there was a coldness thereafter.

Edit: Reading your judgments has been interesting! I do seem to be a less sound person than I thought, both ethically and mentally. I can accept that I am an asshole, if maybe a rakish, gentleman diamond thief kind of asshole. A loveable rogue, if you will.

Thank you all for an entertaining and enlightening evening.

She calls her stepdad “dad” because he’s been in her life since she was three and he lived with her primary parent. Her dad had to travel a lot for work so she only saw him every other week or maybe not for a whole month so she’s naturally closer to her stepdad. 


Which I get. But I travel a lot for my work as well and can be gone for long periods of time. If we were to get married, have kids, and get divorced (I hope not but it’s a real reality) I know she would have her other partner be called “dad” by the kids and I don’t want that.

158,YTA,AITA for “playing the race card” when it’s not about my race?,"My girlfriend is Korean and often cooks our meals. For lunch at work I tend to bring left overs. Usually Korean food, specifically kimchi. I know kimchi can be pungent but honestly I’ve never personally found it offensive. I can understand how others might though.  
 
Recently one of my coworkers has been harassing me to stop bringing it. Me and this coworker are not close and really the only time she talks to me is to talk about how she doesn’t like my food. 
 
It call came to a head on Friday when she approached me again. This time I could tel she was really upset. 
 
At work we have a 3 hour block that we can take a 1 hour lunch break during. I offered a solution that I’d take my break during the first hour (1130) and she could take hers during any point of the other two. That way she wouldn’t have to smell my food. She got really upset saying she shouldn’t have to change her eating habits because I want to bring disgusting food. 
 
I said something along the lines of “this is kimchi. It’s traditional Korean food. what would you do if we hired an actual Korean person and this is what they wanted to eat?” 
 
At this point a few people were looking at us. The coworker backed down but not before saying “you can’t play the race card when you’re not apart of that race”. 
 
I don’t think I’m TA for standing up for myself but AITA for bringing race into it? 
 
Edit: just wanted to clarify I’m not microwaving the kimchi. Also the kimchi is bought from the store and brought as a side dish with what ever left overs is.

159,YTA,AITA for blaming my lack of excitement about my wife's pregnancy on my wife?,"There are a couple of things she's done which has killed the mood. 

First, the way she told me was what started us off on a bad note. Instead of doing a thoughtful announcement, she just gave me the positive pregnancy stick with a note telling me I was going to be a father. Didn't even get a card. I tried not to obsess over it but it felt low effort on her part and like she didn't really give a rip. 

Second, she got her cycle dates wrong and ovulated early which is what led to the pregnancy. I know some will say that I could have worn a condom or taken responsibility, but this is the type of birth control we agreed on as a couple. I put my trust in her to stay on top of things, and I can't help but feel like she let us both down. 

Third, she's been unpleasant to be around since she found out. Always in a bad mood and sassy. I can't even ask a simple question without snark. It's still early weeks, so I'm already dreading having to do this until next July when she's due. I fantasize sometimes about running away or just not coming back home and have been trying to stay away from home as much as possible to limit how much I have to see her. 

We've argued about my attitude and lack of excitement, and I made it clear to her that I feel she is 100% to blame based on three reasons. She accepted some blame but said that I need to also take responsibility for my own actions and by not doing so I am the asshole. She has tried to blame some of it on the pregnancy, but I think she's just looking for a scapegoat so she can feel better about herself and the role she's played in our current struggles. 

The only reason I believe she might not be wrong is because I've been so angry and over things that I don't completely trust my judgment. I can tell it is affecting me in some ways, so I am hoping to find out if there's a chance I've been the asshole for blaming my wife for my lack of excitement.",2020-11-20 23:44:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jy0ana/aita_for_blaming_my_lack_of_excitement_about_my/,978,995,0.82,2

Even if they’re some kind of expert in their field my first instinct is to doubt what they say. My brother (29M) says it’s because I labor under the delusion that I am smarter than I actually am, and that I was an asshole for thinking I new better and never apologizing when I’m wrong. 

My sister in law, R, is a nurse, and yesterday in a family zoom she said unfortunately she wouldn’t be able to join everyone for Thanksgiving.

I got a message from my mom saying I owe R an apology. I said I wasn’t going to apologize for that. My brother is saying I need to grow up and stop being an asshole and the sooner I realize I’m not the smartest person in the room, the better my life will be.

161,YTA,AITA for not cuddling my son?,"I know this sounds bad, but hear me out.

Ever since I (F37) was 5 I have generally hated physical contact with most other people. I refused to hug or kiss my parents, didn't hold hands with family /friends etc, hate maintaining eye contact and the like. I think may parents were bothered about it as I grew up but just accepted it and it really wasn't an issue.

I have always hated the custom of hugging friends when we meet up and I detest cheek kissing. I know this is weird but it makes me physically uncomfortable, but I only have a small circle of close friends who have known me forever and its not been an issue.

I had a son when I was 27 and obviously love him thoroughly and as a baby he had plenty of cuddles etc. But since he was a toddler I haven't really had much physical contact with him. I find it uncomfortable (don't know how else to put it.. I have a revulsion?). For the most part I didn't think he was bothered, he has plenty of attention, I'm just not cuddly with him. (we have private handshakes /fist bumps etc) 

But the other week, he told me it bothered him that all the rest if our family /his stepdad cuddles him but that I don't. I tried to explain it, but I'm not sure as a 10 Yr old he could understand. I feel rotten about it but it's not just him, it's evidently how I'm wired.

But here's where I may be TA, with my partner I am always snuggled up, we are very close physically (and I always have been with sexual partners) but to me physical contact is only for one person, the one I am with, anyone other than that ant it feels wrong/awkward/horrible to me. I'm wondering whether I shouldn't show so much physical affection in front of my son. 

My mum thinks I am TA for this, I should either hug my son as much as my partner or keep physical contact with my partner strictly private. And that I should just ""get over it"" and put up with feeling uncomfortable hugging my son because my feelings do t count when it comes to that kind of situation.

Edit: I do not starve my son of physical contact. He often lies with his legs over me, I tickle him, we have secret handshakes, I hug him. I also explain my feelings to him and we discuss his feelings. I just don't feel comfortable cuddled up face to face with him.",2020-11-13 13:56:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jtgouy/aita_for_not_cuddling_my_son/,1110,1862,0.89,3

She's a doctor and has been working at the local hospital for three years after moving from another town. We'd argue sometimes over different matters but nothing major or too serious until now.

Now I'm not the type that calls every other hour whenever she's away or anything, I give her her space and I respect her privacy. I never really try to even ask how her day at work was because she likes to keep work/personal life separate. Understandably so. But things have changed. I noticed three was this guy who has been a patient under her care who always gets brought up. For example she'd have his number and call him outside of work, I was surprised when I heard her talking about hi, to a close female friend of hers. And when I asked she told me ""patient confidentiality"" so I shouldn't ask who this guy is. I basically knew nothing about him other than he receives treatment under her care. That's it. I tried to let it go and thought nothing of it. But I couldn't ignore her interest in this particular patient after she started contacting him during late times at night for long periods I just confronted her and she lashed out saying I was trying to get involved in her job and trying to control her.

I ended up reporting her anonymously after she behaved like this. And I did my best to not make her feel I had anything to do with it but she came home and yelled at me telling me that I was behind the issue she had at work and that the hospital officials have spoken with her and got the patient involved as well after they received a complaint against her, she somehow knew and yelled at me for wanting to ruin her career by being petty. She refused to sit down and talk. Packed her things and left. She told me to not try to contact her because she wanted to rethink being with someone who has no regard for her hard work. I tried to explain to her but she keeps lashing out at me.

I felt absolutely terrible but her reaction wasn't fair to me at least. She didn't even think how her behavior was affecting me and kept calling me petty .

Info: I was able to determine exactly which patient she was talking to her friend about by talking to her friend. Otherwise I wouldn't have felt strongly that something was going on. Her friend told me that my fiancee mentions this patient a lot and talks about him in details. She'd get so defensive whenever I try to have a conversation with her about this issue and make sure I get 0 answers. Also whenever she's on the phone with him she'd walk out and stay gone for a long time. Then stays quiet afterwards. Honestly at this point it's pretty obvious and I feel so bad that she's behaving like this now after 6 years. I've never seen her act like this ever.

I tested this out and my friends called the venue asking about hosting other events and a wedding and it would be an additional 1700 dollars for us to host a wedding than ""other"" so we did other.

last year we moved to a completely new state. we started new jobs and got the ball rolling but one thing I've noticed is I never could make long term friendships. I got a long with my coworkers but never hung out with them.

then I met Amelia who was super great and willing to hang out with me. we had a lot of good times to where I could finally call her my friend.

she knows I love my husband and will put him first all the time.

I don't know why but today was different. 2 weeks ago we decided to pick a date to go to a haunted attraction, which ended up being tonight. I saved up some money for it. then yesterday my husband announced he had the day off and said lets have a whole day as a date.

165,YTA,AITA for not letting my daughter watch shows with me after she got her nose pierced without my permission (and an ugly one at that)?,"My daughter is 17 and she and I used to be very close. On the weekends, we would stay up late at night and watch whatever random B rated horror movies we could find on Netflix. But now I can't even look at her.

Recently, she asked her father for permission to get a nose ring (I don't know what in the Heaven's name he was thinking to actually say yes!) I've been adamant about nose rings. We don't do them. If you want to get them when you're 18 and on your own fine, but not while you're under my roof.

The point is, I was completely blindsided. She came home, like, ""Mom, guess what?"" and showed me this (septum?) ring and I nearly fainted. 

It's not even one of those cute little button ones that maybe I could have tolerated. It looks like one of those rings you put in the nose of a bull! 

I was furious and I asked her, ""Why? Why would you do that to your beautiful nose? And without my permission? And what kind of stupid ring *is* that?? If anything, why not a cute, little nose stud?""

And then I went crazy on my husband for letting her get it, and he said that she was going to get it anyway so he just wanted to be there to make sure that she was okay. And I said, ""Without my permission though?"" and he was quiet but he later apologized.

That was on Friday. Things have been pretty tense since then. I've calmed down considerably, but everytime I think of how they went behind my back like that, I get riled up again. Throughout the day, I find myself just peeking at her nose ring. 

Today, I was going through Netflix looking for a movie to watch and my daughter came over and quietly sat beside me. I found a B movie and I put it on, and we were watching it silently for a moment, but then I could see her nose ring in the TV reflection and I stood up and said, ""I'm sorry, I can't. I'm not going to watch this movie with that ridiculous nose ring showing in the reflection"" and I walked off to watch TV in my bedroom.

I fell asleep, but my 14 and 15 year old daughters woke me up and told me they could hear their sister crying. Her door was locked and she screamed at me to leave her alone. So I said, ""Oh, don't worry, I will. But see the way you feel right now? That's how I felt when you didn't listen to me and went behind my back.""

Obviously, I still love my daughter, but I don't like what she did. Or the way she just went behind my back and did what she wanted like what I said as her mother didn't even matter. (And she still hasn't apologized either).",2020-11-18 01:50:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jw6oqf/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter_watch_shows_with/,965,1347,0.81,3
166,YTA,AITA for seeking solace in an online community support group after my daughter came out to me as gay?,"When my daughter told me that she was gay, I did all the right things. I thanked her for telling me, I told her it was going to be okay, I reassured her that I still loved her. But inside, I was scared for her. Scared for what other people what think, scared for how she would be treated, and scared above all else for her relationship with God. But God told us it isn't our place to judge, so I just focused on smiling, showing my love, and praying for her.

But I also cried. A lot. Not in front of her, but a lot. And it got so bad that I knew I needed help. I needed to talk to people that could relate and understand, but I didn't want to talk to anyone that we knew personally, so I went online and found a support group for a Christian parents with LGBT kids. We do Zoom calls, and just seeing other parents going through what I'm going through was such a relief and it's really been keeping me going for these past few weeks.

Usually, I attend these calls with my face camera off, but today, I finally felt comfortable enough to turn my face camera on and tell my story. I wound up breaking down and crying, but it was so therapeutic.

Unfortunately, my daughter heard me and came in the room and found out what was happening and said, ""Wow. So me being gay was such a burden to you, you had to join a support group?""

I honestly didn't know what to say. I was feeling so many emotions at once that my brain just shut down and I tried to like turn it around on her by getting angry and saying, ""Really? Were you listening by the door? Couldn't you knock first?"" 

She just said, ""Unbelievable. Don't worry, I know what you think of me now,"" and walked out.

I don't know what to do. I tried my best. I don't think it's fair that I shouldn't be allowed to join a support group, or that me joining would be any reflection on her. This is a *me* problem that *I've* been dealing with by myself. But now I feel ashamed for doing that, and I don't think I should feel that way.

167,YTA,AITA for telling my brother that his wife ruined her own (and his) life?,"Today I went with my brother (I'll call him Sam) to visit his wife (I'll call her Amanda) in prison. Why she's in there is a long story. 

Basically, Sam and Amanda are very different people. He's quite a simple man. He's got an OK job (welder) which he enjoys and isn't particarly ambitious. He enjoys just having fun with his family (they have a four year old daughter, Lexi). He's practically a giant child himself and loves just running around and being silly and making Lexi laugh. He's a hopeless romantic who doesn't care what kind of life he lives so long as it's with Amanda and Lexi. 

Amanda is the total opposite. She's a very ambitious and competitive person. She works at a senior/executive role at a big company and loves it. She loves the finer things in life. She's got a huge collection of gorgeous clothes, shoes, bags etc and always dresses beautifully. 

Opposites attract in their case, but it's good because they've always brought out the best and stopped the worst in each other. She stops him from treating everything as fun and games and reminds him to have some ambitions like fitness etc. He stops her from getting too ambitious and competitive and gives her a lot of support with work stress. 

I won't say exactly what Amanda did to get sent to prison. All I will say is that she did go too far in her attempt to reach a goal, and crossed a boundary into something illegal. 

As Amanda was by far the higher earner, they've lost quite a big chunk of income since her employment was terminated. They've still got more than enough money saved up and Sam is on a decent salary. The prison she's in is a 3 hour drive from where they live, but he tries to take Lexi to see Amanda as much as possible. 

When I saw her in prison I barely recognised her. She's a shell of the person I knew. Obviously her career is destroyed and she has no idea what to do when she gets out. This is the first time I've seen her since she got locked up and she was crying her eyes out. Sam was crying with her and hugging her and promising his ""sweetheart"" that all would be well. 

Obviously I held her hands and told her it would all be OK, but when we left and were in the car home, I told Sam I didn't feel sorry for his wife at all. She chose to screw people over to get what she wanted. She had a great job, a husband who adored her and a beautiful child. But that wasn't enough for her. She still wanted more and committed crimes to get it, and that has ruined their lives. 

Sam was enraged. He dropped me home and told me that he doesn't want to hear from me at all unless I apologise. My husband thinks I should, because he's still hurting and misses her. 

I don't think what I said was wrong. Sam needs to accept his wife's own role in where she's ended up.",2020-11-13 19:12:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jtm3gu/aita_for_telling_my_brother_that_his_wife_ruined/,557,5557,0.94,2
168,YTA,AITA for not going to 'my' daughter's birthday after promising to because of this...,"I was in a relationship with this woman and 'we' had a girl, Kasey, together. Trying to keep this as relevant and short as possible, found out that she's not my biological child. Broke up with lady but, though it wasn't the same, I still kept contact with Kasey and tried being there but not that actively. Months ago she asked whether or not I'd still be coming to her 13th birthday given everything and I said yes and we discussed taking her for the weekend after. Well that was before her darling of a mother came after me for cs which is something I drastically underestimated and didn't would happen but the law proved to be quite a bitch. Trying to sort that out but it's not looking promising. Anyways that's neither here nor there. The point is that I've actually become pretty demotivated to continue with the relationship we had before because mum's always going be there and I'd prefer to cut that off as much as I can which sucks because Kasey's a great kid. There's just more bad then good. As soon as I got the reminder for her birthday I called her and told her that I was sorry but couldn't come anymore go her birthday nett Friday nor do that weekend thing and wished her early. She obviously wasn't merry but it didn't sound like she was going to break down. Some friends think I'm being a complete to her and should at least end it by going to her birthday which is dramatic af imo and would make the day all depressing.

169,YTA,AITA for not defending my wife?,"Recently learned of this subreddit and thought this was the best place to ask, as my wife and I are having a major disagreement. 
Essentially, my wife is tired of me never defending her. I guess she hit a breaking point recently. Her SIL (my brothers wife) doesn’t like her at all. My wife has been nothing but kind to her, but my SIL was her high school bully and I guess just never grew out of it. My SIL is constantly insulting my wife to me, telling me that she is a w****, among other sexist insults. Honestly I always just ignore it. My wife hates it. She doesn’t understand why I can’t just tell her to stop. She sees it as me going along or “laughing off” what my SIL is saying. Frankly I just don’t want involved. There has been multiple times where this has happened with different people, my boss making sexual comments about her, etc. but I always ignore it because I really don’t want to start some sort of conflict, she knows this. But I guess she’s finally at her breaking point with it and she wants me to start doing something. I dont know what she expects from me. What am I supposed to do? Start fighting people for her honor or something? AITA for not defending her? Or is she just being over dramatic?
Editing because she told me to add this. She asked that I at least tell her when SIL messaged me insulting her and that I never do. I don’t see why she even wants to know that though? Also I blocked SIL and I figured that would solve our problems but for some reason she’s still mad at me. She said that it felt like I was avoiding the problem instead of dealing with it. What does she want me to do now? Unblock her and send a strongly worded text?

Edit again. My wife has informed me that she’s staying with her parents while she thinks through things. She also told me I should’ve married my SIL because “clearly” I care more about SIL than I do her, which I feel is hurtful and ridiculous.",2020-11-21 20:44:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jyi79a/aita_for_not_defending_my_wife/,681,888,0.86,2
170,YTA,AITA for not wanting to help my wife with our child after they have gone to bed?,"So..long story short, my wife and I share the responsibility of parenting equally all throughout the day. After we have put our child to bed, thats my signal that I can play video games and my wife be okay with it, which she is. 

The issue lies in the fact that the games which I like to play are online and thus when I'm in the middle of one, there is no pausing the game. 

Now, when our child wakes up at night, she berates me for not stopping what I'm doing immediately and helping her. I have absolutely 0 qualms with helping her...after I finish the game I'm in. It doesn't seem fair to me to let my teammates down when I'm not going to be much help to my wife regardless. I always immediately say I will help you as soon as this game as over...queue meltdown from my wife. 

So...am I the asshole?

Edit: For clarity, I work in an incredibly stressful occupation most days of the week while my wife stays home with the children. Once I come home, I still help with our child until they go to sleep. Then I retreat to play videogames..they're what keep my sane.

Edit2: My wife gets her free time during the day on the weekends to do as she pleases and is why she's okay with me playing games at night. Also, my child IS NOT  an infant. When it's my turn to watch our child individually, never have a had to call my wife and request her come home to assist me. I know what requires the aid of 2 parents. If my child genuinely needed both of us while I was playing, I would not hesitate to help.

Edit3: My wife is not trying to sleep when these events occur. This is also her pseudo free time that she gets on top of the time she gets when I have a day off or she just needs a break during the day.

Edit4: I mentioned in a comment our child drinking juice at night and it has been highly controversial. Our child normally drinks milk at night and yes we do occasionally give heavily watered down juice. Our child brushes before bed and in the morning and the dentist has had no issues with it so we roll with it.

Edit5: I'm getting some serious hate so I'm going to attempt to clarify as best I can. I take over all parenting responsibilities when I get home from work so my wife can do as she pleases. My wife is also free to do as she pleases during my days off. We share tasks when she chooses not to do anything with her free time. We also share tasks at night when we are both in bed. This arrangement is agreed upon by both of us. My issue is not getting the same uninterrupted personal time that she gets. Hope this clears things up. Also, I don't appreciate the personal attacks and assumptions in my DMs.

Edit6: There seems to be a massive assumption that when I take over watching our after getting off of work that I'm not helping with household chores etc. This is completely false. I wouldn't say my wife is free to do with her time as she pleases if this weren't the case. My wife and I work very hard to keep the house spotless. We try and share the responsibility of cleaning as closely as possible but were both aware thats not entirely possible when she is home more than me.

Edit7: I'm starting to regret making my first post in this sub. People here seem so quick to make an assumption rather than ask a clarifying question. I have tried to lay out the facts as best I can. I appreciate those of you who gave constructive criticism and those of you who asked clarifying questions. I doubt I will be entertaining the individuals who make vast assumptions or threaten me for much longer. I was down voted for making genuine points and trying to explain myself.

Edit8: Our child is far from an infant. Our child is 3 years old and its not like I'm letting our child wail and scream. If you're a parent you know what sounds mean what based on the child.

Edit9: I have received a lot of advice that I should sot down with my wife and discuss my feelings with her. We have had this discussion in the past. Her issue is that I am busy with video games and not something that she sees as something worthy of being busy for. She has explicitly told me that she wouldn't mind if I was busy with something other than video games.

Last edit: I came here looking for genuine advice. I suffer from pretty severe anxiety and depression. I certainly was not anticipating coming here and having people tell me I should kill myself, that I shouldn't have had kids, etc. I dont know what to think right now. 

I appreciate everyone that had kind words. I will do my best to respond when I get the opportunity.",2020-11-06 12:42:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jp4exw/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_my_wife_with_our/,1111,2980,0.87,4
171,YTA,AITA for telling my friends I think my wife uses her pregnancy as an excuse to get out of things?,"I'll admit that it sounds bad, but I think the context is extremely important. I said this to a group of friends in what was supposed to be a private conversation just between us. On top of that I was venting some frustrations. None of that is abnormal; everyone does it even if they pretend like they don't. Same with letters people write and don't send. People are allowed to vent, and if we judged everyone by their venting, we'd all be assholes, I think. 

The fact is that she's been hard to be around and demanding since she got pregnant and wants to be pampered all the time. I don't mind a lot of it since it's what I signed up for, but I'm working full time and have a lot on my plate. In addition to taking care of her, I'm helping to take care of my sick grandmother. That makes it hard to not only do everything I was doing but most of what she did before she got pregnant. 

Some of it makes sense like things involving a lot of heavy lifting or things with chemicals, but simple thing like running to UPS, doing a load of laundry or getting groceries I think she should still be able to do since she isn't that far along (four months). I know that having twins makes a difference but still from what I read it seems like she's doing less than is normal, which makes me feel like she isn't helping as much as she could.

Some how word of what I said got back to her, and it was not good. I tried to explain to her that it was mostly venting and that it wasn't fair to take me to task over this because it was meant to be a private conversation, but she said that was BS. We then had an argument about whether my comments were inappropriate. I refused to take them back because I feel there is a lot of truth to them, but she thinks I am being too hard on her and have no empathy for what she's experiencing. So now this has turned into a fight over whether I'm the asshole for telling the truth instead of biting my tongue to make her feel better. 

If what I said is true, am I still the asshole for saying it instead of protecting her feelings? She also says I am the asshole for talking about my friends to her behind her back, but I was venting. In that context I don't see how I was really bad mouthing her. Am I also the asshole for expressing my frustrations to my friends openly?",2020-11-19 03:31:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jwv5oo/aita_for_telling_my_friends_i_think_my_wife_uses/,756,908,0.9,0
172,YTA,AITA for keeping a crude trophy my brothers and friends gave me to celebrate my wife's pregnancy?,"I am the youngest of four brothers and they all already have kids, so they've been teasing me for years about when I was going to, in their words, man up and get the job done. It was all in good fun and never meant in a mean-spirited way. They were really excited for me when my wife and I announced that we were going to be parents, so they and my two closest friends went in together and got me a trophy to commemorate the announcement. It's a large penis with an engraving that says ""This F trophy is awarded to \[my name\] in commemoration of a successful impregnation of \[wife's name\] in A.D. 2020. Mission accomplished.   

I think it's hilarious and clever on their part, but my wife doesn't like it and wants me to give it back or throw it away. I've told her that she's being too sensitive and knows that my brothers and friends are just congratulating me in their own way. It doesn't have anything to do with her, but she feels it's disrespectful and gross and that by keeping it and siding with them I am treating her not like a wife and partner but like a baby maker only. She says that it makes her feel devalued and like maybe I don't feel we are equal partners in this. 

I honestly think that it's a bizarre way to look at this and strange to read that much into a gag gift (no pun intended). It's not meant to be a commentary on anything. It's meant to be crude and funny!

I keep it in my office and away from anywhere that we might have guests, so I don't see the harm in keeping it. It's not like I'm flaunting it or she has to look at it. I can't believe that she's so bothered just by it being somewhere in the house to the point that she's upset and thinks I'm TA for keeping it. 

I don't like fighting about this during what should be a happy time for us, but I think she's overreacting and don't see how any of this is about our relationship or how I feel about her. It's just a stupid gift. Do you think I am the asshole?",2020-11-17 04:34:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jvmndp/aita_for_keeping_a_crude_trophy_my_brothers_and/,828,873,0.87,4

Even though the lake will be frozen in the winter, they plan on getting there by snowmobile. This is just her way of making sure they won’t have an excuse to entertain guests. I told her that they can’t just shut themselves out from the world during the holidays.

174,YTA,AITA for prioritizing my son's grades over spending time with my daughter?,"My daughter (19F) was home from college for the weekend two weeks ago. She came home for her friend's birthday on Friday. This is the first time I (47F) had seen her since the semester started. She hasn't called much since the beginning of the semester which made me a little nervous. She's always been a chubbier girl, but I noticed she had lost a lot of weight in a short time span. I asked her if she was doing ok and she said yes. She seemed pretty upset when I asked about the weight loss. I am worried about her, but she says she's doing ok. I'm proud of her for losing the weight though. I had to work that weekend, but I got to see her in the evenings. Apparently my son (22M) and her tried to do something while I was at work, but he needed to finish an assignment for school.

My son was really upset about the assignment he was working on and I wanted to make his day a little better. So we ordered in. I was trying to help my son with his homework, but he didn't understand it and neither did I. My daughter wanted to watch a movie with me, but my son really needed to get his homework in. I did choose to help him with his homework rather than watch a movie with my daughter. I felt bad and apologized for it multiple times, but she said it was fine. Before she left though, she made it very clear that it wasn't fine. She got mad at me and said that no one wanted to spend any time with her and that she wasn't valued in the family and the only one that paid her any attention was her younger brother (13M) who pesteredher all weekend. It's all probably just hormones, but it's been bugging me. She hasn't called me since and I'm worried she won't come home for Thanksgivings. I try calling, but she never answers.

And well I see my mother(and obviously I don’t swipe right you sickos) And I hate to say this but my mom came across as a typical tinder ho. Saying not to swipe right if you aren’t 6’0+ and very muscular, having pictures showing of her butt(ew ew ew ew), and saying shit like she is down to eat a guys ass(ew x infinity). Obviously seeing all this shit horrified me and completely killed my desire to get laid. 

I later tell my mom what I saw. She’s surprised because we aren’t even in the same age range and makes a joke about me going after milfs. I tell her to stop joking around because this is serious. I ask my mom if she can at least make her profile a bit more classy and she immediately says no. Says that tinder is a fun hookup app so that’s what she is gonna do, have fun. And says I wouldn’t even have this problem if”You weren’t trying to fuck somebody’s mom.” I leave her with me saying”I just hope you know I’m disappointed in how you are handling this situation.” She tells me there is no situation and that was the end of that.

Last week was our anniversary and I decided I wanted to propose. Since we met via Skyrim, I thought I would promise with the amulet of Mara, which is the symbol that someone is ready for marriage. She doesn’t really wear jewelry or anything and has never shown me a ring she likes when we’ve talked about marriage so I thought it’d be sweet to have something that brought us together. 

I set up this whole picnic with our favorite things and when I proposed, she looked sad and asked about a ring. I told her I thought the amulet of Mara was sweet because we met via Skyrim. 

The other day she sat me down and said she thought the amulet was very sweet and she liked it, but she wanted to go ring shopping. I told her I had already bought the necklace and I didn’t see any reason for a ring since I didn’t propose with one. She said she appreciated the sweet gesture but she really wanted a traditional ring.

177,YTA,AITA for not letting an employee give his daughter a company-issued laptop but giving my own daughter one?,"So I am the head of a company for my country. It is not a large company, but I get paid 6 figures and the CEO is a good friend of mine. I have been in the company for 2 years, and it is time for me to get a new phone and laptop. We get the newest tech each time we need to upgrade, but we don’t get the top-of-the-line tech, (e.g. iPhone 12 instead of 12 pro, and MacBook Pro 13’ over MacBook Pro 15’). My daughter (15) asked if she could have my phone and laptop when I retired them in spring, and so I said yes. I didn’t ask the CEO because I know he would say yes, as he is like a godfather/uncle to her, and she was even there for the birth of his child. I mean, all of the other tech will go to me to be given to interns and sold on eBay, so why not?

My daughter is friends with the daughter of the head of sales, someone who I hired just after I joined, so he is also ready to give up his laptop and phone. She, excited, told her friend that she was getting a new laptop, and I assume that the daughter went home and asked her dad if she could do the same, because later that night I got an email from the head of sales for my country. He pretty much said he wanted to give his daughter his laptop and asked if it was ok, to which I said of course not. It is company property, and is still worth around 700 dollars. He got a little fed up and asked why my daughter could have my laptop, but his daughter couldn’t? 

This is of course a stupid question, and IMO is like a teacher expecting the same privileges as a super-intendant, and it is frankly entitled to talk to your boss like that, not to mention the deep personal relationship we have with the CEO. My Fiancée said that our daughter shouldn’t get higher privileges than his, and I should just let him have it, but I just don’t think it is right to. 
So, AITA?

Edit: I am the COO

Edit 2: we pay all of the executives the same, including the CEO, myself and the sales director in question because we want a balanced wage for the top of the company. This is still a new company and it lets us hire the best staff. 

Edit 3: I did not treat him like crap, I didn’t say anything to him, except ‘no’. also, for all of those privately messaging me and telling me that you hope the company fails, you might not have realised it but in doing so you are also wishing that the sales director and around 200 others will also lose their jobs.

178,YTA,AITA because I “ruined” my best friend’s wedding cake?,"So my(24f) best friend K (24f) was married recently. Small wedding, tight budget. She knows that I pride myself on my baking skills and asked if I’d consider baking her cake. Of course I said yes and that I’d do it as a wedding gift to them, free of charge.

There’s this video I found scrolling on Facebook where a guy who was bringing the cake to the sweetheart table tripped and fell, all over the cake. I thought it was hilarious so I asked my brother if he’d mind getting messy. He thought it was hilarious too and agreed.

So I prepared two identical cakes - one as a joke, for the trip/fall/smash and the other to say, “Haha! Gotcha!” K has a great sense of humor and her husband A does as well so I thought things would be fine.

Wedding goes great, reception going great, time to bring out my cake. My brother was carefully walking the cake to the sweetheart table when he “suddenly tripped”, landing on the cake on the floor. Everyone froze for a few seconds, but K burst into tears. My brother started immediately saying apologies, the floor was slippery, it’s just a cake, etc. K would not calm down.

People stood up to console K and survey the damage, helping my brother up as well. When he stood, he turned to look at me and I nodded and we met in the kitchen. Bro changed into his backup clothes and grabbed the other perfect cake.

I walked into the room and whistled so I could get everyone’s attention. Then my brother walked out of the kitchen and we both yelled, “GOTCHA!” And successfully delivered the perfect cake in front of K and A. We explained it was a joke, the cake wasn’t ruined after all, but K didn’t find it funny and yelled at me for ruining her wedding.

It was just a joke. We cleaned up the messy cake and had the other cake ready to go. K lost nothing, except maybe her sense of humor. I don’t know. But now her family is mad at me and K refuses to talk to me.

179,YTA,AITA for not paying my engagement photographer?,"Throwaway.

My partber and I just had our engagement photos taken (safely, with precautions). The photographer was recommended to us by a friend whose photos impressed us so we contacted the photographer, paid their deposit, and hired them for the day, which was day before yesterday.

My partner and I chose a location that meant a great deal to us, is easy to access but somewhat remote, as to avoid other people in our shots or outside influence in our photos. My partner and I arrived on time at the location ready to shoot. There was nothing we needed to do to get ready.

The photographer was half an hour late before they called us to let us know they were late and they were a further hour late. When the photographer arrived they had their young child as well. They didn't tell us they'd be bringing a child with them when we booked nor did they tell us when they called us to say they'd be late. They explained that their childcare fell through and they couldn't find a replacement but we were their only appointment for the day so it wasn't an issue (on their end).

It took nearly half an hour for the photographer to set up their equipment. Mind you at this point we had been supposed to begin an hour before and, figuring we'd not be finished anytime soon, my partner had to cancel our plans for after the shoot, upsetting many people and causing disappointment. Their attitude was also incredibly brusque and abrupt. They were also kind of pushy and bossy.

When the photographer finally started shooting their child began acting out and they had to stop every few minutes to parent the child. It sort of ruined the afternoon for us because when the photographer wasn't paying attention my partner and I were trying to keep the child from getting hurt.

The photographer took an hour's worth of photos and we all departed. On the way home I told my partner I wasn't paying for any of it because the photographer was stopping every few moments to watch the child, the child causes massive disruptions, and how the photographer was late and had a negative attitude.

This morning the photographer emailed us the photos they'd taken and despite everything the photos were actually really good. That said, I told the photographer that we wouldn't be using the photos or paying her because of everything I listed above.

The photographer started blowing up my phone with nasty texts. When they threatened a law suit I blocked them. My partner deleted the photos that had been emailed to us because we didn't want them.

Our friend who recommended the photographer to us said she was surprised because the photographer had been great for her and her fiancé. She said we suck because we let the photographer do all the work for nothing. I mean, we did pay a deposit (nonrefundable).

Are we asshole for refusing to pay?

ETA: I'm reading all the comments and I hear everyone. I would like to add that my contract with this person said I would receive 300 photos, which I did not. That being said I am going to contact the photographer and offer to pay for the 100 photos delivered. I didn't receive what was agreed upon in totality but I am ready to do the right thing.",2020-11-13 08:40:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jtdorz/aita_for_not_paying_my_engagement_photographer/,524,2315,0.94,0

Tina (not her real name) told me today she was going to buy one of the new Macbook Airs for college. I told her I didn't want her getting anything Apple because they're overpriced and unreliable - that she'd just be buying into the brand marketing. She said that my positions make no sense, and that ""its specs outweigh the price premium."" I pointed out that the model she wants has only 8GB of RAM...meanwhile, my $600 PC has 64GB.

She went on about how they have a ""new processor"" (that'll quit being supported in 5 years) and the batteries ""last forever"" (until they eventually expand and crack the laptop in half). To which I told her to just build a desktop, learn her way around Arch, and she'll have a good computer for the next 15 years. That wasn't good enough for her, and the rest of her points were basically that she doesn't want to mess with WINE ::eyeroll:: and that she shouldn't need her permission since she works full-time, and is thus ""responsible.""

...To which I told her that as long as long as she's under my roof, she'll abide by my rules. Which means I get the final say in what she, a minor, purchases. And I'm convinced she's just buying whatever Instagram influencers tell her to, as I can't think of a single reason why she needs a Macbook. AITA?

She agreed, though later said she prefers cooking herself. We bought lobster, oyster, fancy cheeses, nice wine etc. She was preparing dinner, and setting the table, putting on candles and got dressed up. In my view, we had a lovely dinner date, the food was amazing and I thanked her elaborately for the work she put in. She seemed happy, and we cleaned up together and then watched a movie on tv. 

The next day, she is mad at me, and I am confused as we had such a nice evening before. She tells me she was upset that she put in a lot of effort to look nice, and I never changed out of my comfortable house clothes/pyjamas.

183,YTA,AITA for letting my toddler niece use my adult daughter's toy collection?,"This feels ridiculous to me, but my daughter is 24 years old. As a child, she collected these stuffed animals and kept them on a shelf in pristine condition with the tags on. She never played with them or used them and rarely even touched them. But she would get really angry if anyone else ever tried to play with them. 

Now that she's older, it's been several years since she's handled them. She's no longer living here, but works out of state after graduating college. Her collection is still in her room at my home. 

A few weeks ago, I was babysitting my niece overnight. She's 4. She stayed in my daughter's bedroom and asked if she could sleep with a few of the stuffed animals. I figured my daughter likely won't be back anytime soon and probably doesn't care anymore, so I removed the tags of a couple animals (choking hazard) and let her sleep with them. She did get a little drool on them, which I wiped the next day. 

A few days later, I zoomed with my daughter and let her know my niece used a few of her toys. She seemed upset but didn't say anything until I mentioned I took the tags off three of them. Then she completely exploded, telling me that was vandalism and I was out of line for removing tags of toys that didn't belong to me (even though she kept them in my house). I told her she an adult and doesn't need toys anymore. And she told me it was disrespectful of me to damage her possessions that I knew were really valuable to her. 

Then she also told me that her collection, unadulterated, would have been worth thousands, which I didn't know. I feel like she should have told me this, but she just says that I should have known not to mess with her prized collection. She sent me links to the ones that had the tags removed and they're extremely expensive now, but she asked me to replace them. I refused.

184,YTA,AITA for telling my daughter she isn't cut out for medicine?,"Hi all. 

My daughter Lara (15) wants to be a doctor like me. She does have the talent, her grades are excellent and her teachers are very happy with her. However, I think her personality is a very bad match for the profession.

Lara is a very sensitive person. Throughout her childhood she cried constantly. Even the slightest thing could set her off. She's still a frequent crier as a teenager. A high stress environment like medicine would not be good for her. 

Lara is also deeply empathetic. She's quite similar to my husband in that regard. Obviously, careers like medicine, nursing etc need some level of this, but she tends to connect very deeply very easily (like proclaiming someone she's known for a day is her best friend and breaking down sobbing when that inevitably turns out not to be the case). 

On a minor note, it's not just the nature of the work Lara will struggle with. I've been a female medical student. Those girls are snotty and catty. She would be scrutinised not only for her skills, but also what she wears and how she acts. The sort of girls I studied with would make her life a living hell. 

I tried to tell Lara that maybe she should think about something other than medicine. I did try to encourage her by saying there are lots of things she could use her big brain for, but she burst out crying and ran to my husband. He and Lara have quite similar personalities, so he understands where I'm coming from. However, he thinks I shouldn't have been as blunt as I was. 

I don't see how I was blunt at all. I tried to encourage her and praise her talents. All I said was that she should maybe consider something else.

185,YTA,AITA for refusing to take my girlfriend to the ER,"In the past week, my girlfriend has been very constipated and hasn't been able to poop. She tried taking laxatives but they didn't work. After reading some stuff on the internet, she was convinced that she needed to go to the ER. She believes that there is something seriously wrong and that she needs to get a CT scan of her stomach to check to see if she has an impaction. 

I've been with my girlfriend for three years (we're both in our mid-20s) and can definitively say that she is a bit of a hypochondriac. She tends to freak herself out by googling her symptoms, which we all know WebMD will say is cancer, and then proceeds to be scared until she can either see a doctor who will assure her there's nothing wrong or until she feels better. 

Thankfully, she's been in good health recently up until this bout of constipation. Last night, she told me she'd lost her appetite and after failing to poop multiple times, asked me to take her to the ER. Of course I've been very concerned about her health and pain that she's in, but I just didn't think it was severe enough to warrant a trip to the ER. I told her that we could call her primary care doctor the next day and see if we could schedule an appointment ASAP. She refused and continued to ask me to take her to the ER and was in tears at this point. I felt terrible but I continued to say no because 1) she doesn't have good health insurance and a trip to the ER could cost us thousands which we certainly don't have to spare 2) we live in an area that has a staggering number of Covid cases and I'm scared that we could be needlessly exposed 3) I did not think her symptoms were severe enough to warrant a trip to the ER. Since my girlfriend doesn't have a license, I was pretty much her only ride. She spent the rest of the night crying and refusing to talk to me. 

This morning, we got into an argument over the issue again which ended up in her storming out. I've texted one of my friends about this and he said I should just suck it up and take her to calm her fears and that I shouldn't be so unwilling because she's my girlfriend and I love her. Now I'm unsure...maybe I've been a dick and should just take her? AITA?

Edit: Commented this down below, but people said it's helpful so I'm adding that we did try the local urgent care but they're only doing telehealth visits, but my girlfriend wanted to be seen in person. A nurse spoke to us on the phone and asked her if she was vomiting/feverish (symptoms that would warrant an immediate ER visit) and she said no so the nurse said that she could probably hold off. However, my girlfriend did not trust the nurse's opinion since she said a nurse is not a doctor.

Edit 2: **Alright so my girlfriend came back and continued asking me to take her to the ER so I finally did since people said it could be a bowel obstruction which is really serious.** Thanks everyone for the advice. ER doctor said it wasn't severe enough to do scans. He felt around her abdomen and said it wasn't the appendix or gall bladder. He also stuck a finger up her butt and said he felt stool. He basically told us to come back if she starts vomiting or if she experiences severe abdominal pain coupled with a fever. To be very honest, I'm upset that this visit turned out to be so useless. I thought the doc would at least prescribe some meds, but he told her to get ducolex and take more miralax. 

I know that most people here think I'm the asshole and I can definitely see that, but I think I'll just take being the asshole in this situation because I'm pretty fucking pissed at how all of this turned out. I'll be paying bill since my girlfriend is currently jobless. She's honestly worn me out completely and I'll have to reevaluate this relationship.

186,YTA,AITA for offering to cover my date’s facial scar with makeup?,"I (21/f) recently went on a date with a guy(21/m). It started off well and I definitely thought he’s physically attractive. However he has a noticeable facial scar (which I don’t mind) which I’m still getting used to. 

So we were talking and I asked him about his scar. He didn’t really answer and kept changing the topic. I’m very curious by nature so I asked again. Instead of answering my question, he asked me if it’s a dealbreaker and I told him it wasn’t. 

We went on talk about other stuff and my mind wandered a bit. I wondered what he’d look like without the scar(like I said, I’m curious). So at one point I told him that I want to cover his scar with makeup just to see what it looks like. He declined and that was the end of the conversation. Afterwards his entire attitude changed which kind of ruined the mood. 

Later that evening he sent me a goodbye text. I was pretty shocked/confused and asked him why he doesn’t want to go on another date. He said he got the impression that I’m not physically attracted to him and that he understands if I’m not interested. I was pissed and told him we wouldn’t have gone on a date in the first place if I didn’t find him good looking. And I already told him his scar wasn’t a dealbreaker. 

He didn’t reply to me until 2 days later. Now we’re still talking but he gives me 1-2 word replies and doesn’t seem enthusiastic at all. I feel like he doesn’t even care anymore. 

My friends were wondering what was going on between us and I told them the whole story. According to most of them I was a huge AH and should apologise to him immediately. One “friend” even stopped talking to me because of this.Only my closest friend defended me and said that I didn’t mean no harm. She agreed that his behaviour was really uncalled for. 

Am i really the asshole here? I mean he KNOWS that I don’t find him unattractive or anything. Am I the AH or is he just overreacting?

I understand my dad's perspective but I was always closer to my mom and I begged him to let me go. 

But my dad was adamant. He was not a bad father by any means. He definitely loved me and my stepmom is a very nice person.

But I had a huge chip in my shoulder where I felt like he denied me a better life with the parent I preferred to live with.

189,YTA,"AITA for keeping my husband's ""comfort bear"" that holds an audio clip of his dead ex until he agrees to go to therapy?","When my husband was in high school, he dated his best friend at the time for two months. They didn't break up, she died in a car accident, God rest her soul. I also attended the same high school, albeit as a student two years junior, but we only started dating after we both went to colleges that were close by each other.

From when we started dating to now, my husband has had a stuffed bear with an audio clip of his ex saying ""I love you"" in it. You know, one of those bears that you squeeze and they say the audio. Every night, he squeezes it and it supposedly helps him fall asleep. He never went to therapy to get over her death, and the fact that he still has the bear and squeezes it to help him fall asleep at least once every night leads me to believe that he still hasn't moved on from her death.

At first, when we started dating, I was okay with it. I know that everyone has different times for processing loss, and that she wasn't just his lover, but also based on what he told me, she was his best friend who was there for some hard times in his life. However, as the years went on, and he remained attached to the bear if not more so, I suggested and started pushing for therapy. He adamantly refused at the time, saying we couldn't afford it, which was true, because we were both struggling financially. Now, however, we're both financially stable and able to afford therapy. He still refuses to go. We got into a huge fight about it yesterday, and I ended up taking his bear. I told him that I won't give it back until he promises to either attend some sort of online counseling or actual therapy when this pandemic is over. My husband is extremely upset with me.

I don't want him to get rid of the bear by any means. I think that it's a lovely idea to continue to honor the memory of his best friend, but his attachment to the bear is nuts. He NEEDS to hug it every night no matter what, panics is he cant find the bear, panics if I take it for a bit to wash or clean it, etc. I want him to keep the bear, but stop being so attached to it. I communicated this to him several times over the years, but he has either brushed me off or told me that I'm disrespecting his ex.

I know at face value what I did as definitely an asshole move, but I think I have enough justification and reason behind my actions. It's going to be twenty two years next month since she died, and I just don't think his obsessive attachment for this long is healthy. Still though, my husband hasn't talked to me ever since the fight, unless it's him demanding the bear. I'm starting to feel like I did the wrong thing.

edit: I don't know how this got so twisted, but I am not jealous of the bear, or his late girlfriend. The issue isn't the bear, it's my concern for my husband's mental health. Maybe I made a poor judgement call, but it sure as hell wasn't me acting out of my own ""jealousy"".",2020-11-13 03:06:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jt9e7e/aita_for_keeping_my_husbands_comfort_bear_that/,610,1326,0.93,2
190,YTA,AITA for not talking to my daughter about my granddaughter,"I (66M) have five daughters - three from my first marriage and two from my second marriage. 

My eldest daughter Erin(36F), hasn't spoken to me since her wedding four years ago. She invited my younger daughters to her wedding, however my wife and I thought it was inappropriate for them to go. My divorce from my first wife wasn't very amicable, and she ended up making a scene and crying in front of our mutual friends. She also played hardball with the divorce and got most of our marital assets, which I think was more than fair. My ex's sister also verbally assaulted me once while the divorce was ongoing and I had to hide in the bathroom to get away from her. My eldest from my second marriage is very sensitive, and I thought it was very likely that one or both of these women would create a scene which would traumatise her.

When Erin called up to confirm numbers for the wedding, I explained that my daughters wouldn't be attending, and I explained why. I figured that Erin would understand, since she's always been good about this kind of thing. For example, when my wife and I chose to only include our children in our wedding photos, Erin was the only one of my daughters who understood why. Erin had also been the daughter who contacted me the most often, so I figured we had a good relationship to fall back on. I paid for her education and wedding dress too, so she's gotten a lot from me as well.

Well, Erin was furious. She shouted at me over the phone (I was calm and polite throughout), tried to blackmail me into bringing her sisters, and also got her mother to contact me and try to convince me to change my mind. She also said that if my younger daughters couldn't come if her aunt was there, then she'd uninvite her aunt, but I told her not to do that, because I didn't want to ruin her wedding. And besides, her mother was a problem as well, so it didn't matter if her aunt was there or not, my younger daughters still couldn't come to the wedding.

I ended up going to the wedding with just my wife, and it was lovely. Erin spoke to me for about ten minutes during the reception, so I thought that she had gotten over her previous nonsense. However she hasn't tried to call me or text me since. I called a couple of times, but she didn't answer, so I stopped trying. Erin avoided me at my 3rd daughter Lara's wedding, so it seemed pretty clear that she wasn't interested in talking to me..

191,YTA,AITA for wanting to see my son?,"I (30M) had a girlfriend in college who got pregnant when she was 19 and I was 20. I freaked out and (wrongly) blamed her for everything, and said there was no way I wanted to be a dad. I said I would take no part in anything, wouldn’t sign the birth certificate and wouldn’t pay child support. My dad said I’d have to sign my rights away or she could take me to court for a paternity test and child support anyway. So I told her I was going to do that, and she didn’t fight me. 

Fast forward to present day. I had an accident a few years ago that has made it impossible for me to father any children. This was a hard blow to my wife, and our marriage has struggled as I’m not willing to adopt, but she wants children. She knows I fathered a kid when I was younger, so I thought I’d contact my ex about seeing them and maybe my wife would be happy in a stepmom role. My ex said no, and when I protested she basically told me tough luck.

I said they were my kid and she said actually he’s not, I signed my rights away so I had no children as far as the law and she was concerned. My kid has a “real” dad, and a life, and I’ve never been part of it and I never will be. I was so angry I started yelling about taking her to court for custody and she wished me the very best of luck in that endeavor and hung up. I was venting to my brother and he said no judge worth his weight in salt would give me custody or even regular visitation after a decade of no contact just because I suddenly found myself sterile and wanted to appease my wife. I didn’t want a kid, so I don’t have a kid. He also said I’m not treating him like an actual person and did I even once stop to consider the fact he wouldn‘t even know who I was, only that he’d been forced to go stay with someone who didn’t want him. I got upset and stopped talking to him.

I shouldn’t have threatened to go for custody and I admit that, but people are acting like I’ve done the worst thing ever by even contacting my ex so I thought I’d ask, am I really such an asshole?",2020-10-24 15:44:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jhb3ez/aita_for_wanting_to_see_my_son/,1136,5548,0.89,8
192,YTA,AITA for being brutally honest about my experience having teen parents and embarassing them?,"EDIT: After reading the comments and giving it more thought, I have decided to move back into my rented room on Friday. My parents can live their lives pretending that they haven't been neglectful, shitty people. I have told my parents that it's best if we cut contact. But if anyone asks me, I won't hesitate to tell the truth about what they've done.

Apparently me embarrassing them is worse them than me being neglected as a child lol. I accept the judgement.

Original post:

I'm 23 and I'm just starting college. I had to wait to go to college because I went to extremely shitty schools growing up and I got an awful education. I ended up working and going to community college just so I could save up and apply to a proper bachelor's program.

Because of the current situation, I had to move back into my parents home. My roommates work as nurses and I wasn't feeling safe.

My parents had me when they were in high school. They tried their best but teenagers have no business raising a kid.

We struggled most of my childhood and they only ever became stable when I turned 17. I now have two younger siblings who are 5 and 2.

We had a family zoom call recently with my aunt, uncles and grandparents.

We had the normal chit chat. Then my aunt said she was so proud of my parents for stepping up and raising a successful child.

This is where I may have been an asshole. I kinda scoffed/laughed when I heard my aunt say that.

Then my aunt asked ""what's that supposed to mean.""

And I kind of just vented my entire issues of being raised by two immature teenagers who didn't know what they were doing.

That I went to shitty schools and lived in shitty neighborhoods and that I was borderline neglected. And now I'm 4 years behind other people my age.

We just ended the zoom call at that point. 

I never vocalized my issues before but I did that night. 

I told them they were not good parents to me and while I loved them, I don't really respect them.

And that frankly, I'm pretty bitter and jealous seeing my parents be better parents to my siblings than they ever were to me.

My parents were very upset and they apologized. They told me they tried their best.

I just locked myself in my room for the rest of the night and refused to talk to my parents.

The next day, I decided to move back to my rented room but my dad stopped me and was in tears as he apologized again.

Now my parents are on this weird mission to make it all up to me. Which apparently involves some sort of promise to pay my student loans.

All this feels too little and too late for me. But I am still staying in their house because I have asthma and can't afford to get sick.

193,YTA,"AITA for giving my child a Eurocentric name so they wont struggle to find a job, despite my husband wanting our kid to have a traditional African name?","Random account so that I'm hopefully not recognized. I had my son just a week ago. My husband and I had been discussing names for the longest before he was born. He wanted the baby's name to be Jafari, which is a popular African name. (We are both African). 

However, I had been thinking about how unfair America can be when it comes to any POC or darker skinned people in general. A common problem that people like me seem to face is finding jobs simply because our names dont sound ""white"". I struggled with this very much growing up and I didnt want my little boy having as hard of a time.

So when it came time to sign the paper work for the baby, despite my husband's complaints, I signed his name down as Jacob. My husband was furious and said that I was being selfish. To be fair, I had pretended to agree with the name, only to change my mind last second. We argued more after the nurses left, him saying that I was being delusional and that his name wouldn't affect his ability to get jobs. 

All I could do was apologize, but I sincerely felt like I did the right thing. A week later, I feel unsure. 

AITA?

Edit: I dont need anyone telling me that my race isnt the reason I couldn't find jobs or I'm just making excuses for that. I know what I went through growing up.

195,YTA,AITA for not telling my wife that the perfume I buy her is what my first wife wore?,"I was previously married, but that marriage ended due to my wife's passing. In a lot of ways I've still not come to terms with it, but I am better now and have come a long way from where I was after it happened. I try to keep her memory alive with little things that remind me of her, and one of the things I've done since she passed was always keeping some of her brand of perfume around so I could   
keep that scent/her scent present. I'm sure that seems kind of creepy, but it's not uncommon among other widowers I know. 

At some point, I bought it for my current wife as a gift and asked her to wear it. I didn't tell her when I gave it to her that it was the same type my first wife wore, but my first wife's friends and family noticed and I asked them not to say anything. They didn't but told me they felt this was not healthy. I disagreed because I wasn't forcing her to wear it and it was the only thing like this I did. I never asked her to change hairstyles, hair colors, or the way she dressed, so it is not like I was trying to recreate my first wife. It wouldn't have worked even if I wanted to do that because they don't look alike, which I think proves that what I'm doing isn't unhealthy. 

We've now been married for over a decade and my former sister-in-law finally told my wife about the perfume. She thinks I need to move on and stop living so much in the past and believes that my first wife wouldn't want me hiding something like this from my wife or holding onto her in some of the ways I am. I don't get her concerns. She acts like I'm a crazy person, but this is the only thing like this I've done. Ever. I feel like she making this into a big issue when it's not. 

My wife was very upset that I never told her about the perfume being my first wife's favorite, and it has caused some other issues. For one, she now wonders if some of the times I was really attracted to her it was just the perfume and me imagining my first wife. I've tried reassuring her but she won't listen to what I say. 

She thinks I am the asshole for what I did, and my wife's family have all said as much in private over the years because of this secret. I don't think what I did was that bad. I didn't tell her but I never forced her to wear it and haven't tried to change her. She knows I love her and our family, and I always thought of this as a harmless tool to help me deal with the past. 

I don't feel like an AH, but I'm not sure that I can judge myself fairly because I've done this for so long and justified it to myself over the years as a harmless thing that helped me process my feelings. Everyone seems to think I am wrong so I don't know anymore. Maybe I was always the asshole and didn't know it.",2020-11-01 23:24:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jmcg31/aita_for_not_telling_my_wife_that_the_perfume_i/,772,3188,0.93,0

My husband believes I was too harsh with her and should have left her alone. I believe meal time is social time and one needs to be social anytime someone else wishes to socialize.

I hate to admit that I'm not particularly close to my step-sons, because they're still mourning their mom, and I find it awkward to talk to them and interact with them, especially the youngest, who is on the spectrum. I'm not sure how bad it is, but he's nonverbal and doesn't interact with anybody without my husband prompting him. My husband has tried his best with my daughter, and they've been bonding well. 

Recently, my husband and I were talking. He mentioned that my daughter and his oldest son both have conflicting schedules, and that my daughter has an online dance recital at the same time that his son would be doing something else, and I mentioned that if he wanted to supervise his son's thing, that I wouldn't be mad, because I would be supervising my daughter's recital. 

I can't remember exactly what he said, but in response, I said that my daughter would always come before his sons. And an argument came to life. 

He said that it was a terrible thing to say, and that I should be disappointed in myself. However, I was simply telling the truth. I love my step-sons, but my daughter will always be first because she's my child.

I usually don't do anything because she can take care of herself, but in a gym, I feel it's a little different. Gyms are notorious of being full of creepy, testosterone-filled apes who unashamedly hit on female users. I was really annoyed by this and went to talk to her to discreetly ask if everything was OK and to show the guy she wasn't alone.

Afterwards, my wife was livid, and asked why did I do that, and said he wasn't a creep and if he was, she would have told him to get lost. I don't think my reaction was unwarranted.

 I genuinely feel like a single parent or something.

201,YTA,AITA for pretending not to know my wife while I was eating lunch with a prospective client?,"This happened earlier this week, but my wife has still not gotten over it. She even said something to me about it again tonight after I got home. She can't seem to let it go even though I don't feel I did anything wrong, so here I am asking if I am the asshole.  

On Tuesday I had a lunch meeting with a prospective client at a restaurant that sits across from the old courthouse in our town. There's been a group of protesters there for the last few months, but usually it's a small group and it's only sporadically that they're there. On this day they happened to be there. 

As background, my wife has never protested with that group and has never said anything about it. She claims that she has and has talked about it with me, but I have no memory of that. As far as I know, Tuesday was the first time she'd ever joined them. 

After we had been seated and gotten our drinks, I heard someone call out to me. I didn't recognize it as my wife, so I ignored it and kept talking to the prospective client. The person kept calling out my name, so I finally turned to see who it was and I saw my wife across the street with the protesters. It embarrassed me that she would shout at me like that in public, so I didn't respond. Then my prospective client made a comment about the protesters that wasn't nice, so I felt like it was better not to say my wife was one of them. I asked him if we should leave and go somewhere that was quieter, and he agreed. My wife called out to me again and started to cross the street, but by then we were walking away and she didn't follow. 

She was livid when I got home that night and asked me why I ignored her. I was honest and told her it was because she made a scene in public and embarrassed me in front of a potential client. She doesn't believe that justifies ignoring her, but I don't think she gave me much of a choice. 

That's basically where we are now. She thinks I was rude and disrespectful, and I think she was to blame for not telling me what she was doing or using better judgment.",2020-10-31 01:30:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jl9ot7/aita_for_pretending_not_to_know_my_wife_while_i/,880,2677,0.93,0
202,YTA,"AITA for ""slut shaming"" my son?","My son, Logan (21) and I have never really had the greatest relationship. His mother and I split up when he was 7 and I moved a few hours away with my new wife. We still spoke on the phone, I payed child support and I'd visit him if I wasn't too busy (especially for his birthday and around Christmas). As he got older, Logan started to resent me a little bit as I spent more time with his half siblings than I spent with him. But this couldn't really be helped.

One of our common arguments was about how inappropriate he dresses. Logan has some serious body confidence issues and tends to disguise that by colouring his hair very bright colours, getting piercings and, most importantly, wearing (in my opinion) some pretty revealing clothes. He wears a choker/collar thing a lot which he says is just his fashion choice, he wears shorts that are a little too short (nothing extremely revealing but definitely a bit shorter than a normal man's shorts) and I have even seen photos of him on Facebook wearing some sort of belly top thing at a pride march. He also takes a lot of pride in his appearance (e.g. makeup, painting his nails etc.). I just haven't ever approved of this sort of fashion sense, however, his mum is completely fine with it and, well, he does live with her.

Around two months ago, Logan and his mum had to find somewhere else to stay due to renovations. My ex wife's sister said they could stay with her but as they only have one bedroom, my wife and I offered to let Logan stay with us for a little while. Everything was fine, Logan had even agreed to dress a little more conservatively around my kids. However, a week or two later, I had to check an email about my youngest's school and, since my phone was dead and my wife had the laptop, I decided to just quickly check my email on Logan's laptop whilst he was out shopping.

I was shocked with what I found. Logan was logged into messenger and was sending disgusting, sexual messages to another man. There were no pictures but the messages really grossed me out. I questioned Logan about them when he got back and this just started an argument about privacy. I tried to argue that this wasn't the point, he had been sending disgusting  messages to another man. I found out through Logan that his mum knew about this. He had (before covid) been going out on a bunch of dates and whoring himself out to whatever man called him pretty. My ex wife had made sure that he took condoms with him, went through some safety procedures and just allowed him to act like a tramp. I was disgusted and told him as much.

His face just fell and he walked out of the room. He went to his aunts house with his mum and has been ignoring me since. I've had a few angry conversations with my wife where she has accused me of making my son think I'm ashamed of him. I'm ashamed of his behaviour, not him.

My wife has also argued that I may have been a bit harsh but she understands why I freaked.

Reddit, AITA?

Edit - Okay I understand, I'm the AH. It hurt to read all of those comments about me being an awful father but they are sort of true. I shouldn't have read the messages and I should've had more control rather than just freaking out. I was shocked, no parent wants to read about their kids sex life. I just wanted to clear a few things up though, not that it will make me any less of an AH.

I do not have any problems with Logan being gay. He came out to me when he was 15, after he got his first boyfriend. He'd come out to his mum a year earlier, it hurt that he felt like he couldn't tell me first but I get it. I told him I didn't have any issues, as long as he was happy.

The problem I have is that he was sleeping around and is still sexually messaging a bunch of men. If he were my daughter instead or was messaging girls I'd still have the same reaction. It's not about his sexuality, it's about him not knowing his self worth, I would love for him to be in a relationship with a nice guy, not sleeping around to feel more secure. Besides, it can be dangerous.

Anyway, I have tried reaching out to Logan but haven't heard anything back. If he does get in contact then I will be ready to apologise, until then I'll keep trying to reach out to him.

Okay last edit here - A lot of people seem to think I'm trying to play psychiatrist when it comes to Logan's self confidence issues. He does have self confidence issues. I don' know whether or not I am part of it but I do know a lot of it was caused by bullying when he was in school. My ex wife and I have spoken about it before and she has admitted that sometimes he won't even let her see him without makeup/hair done etc. as he's not happy with how he looks. Yes, he is brave for wearing what he wears, I see that now, but my ex wife and I both know for a fact that if he had to dye his hair back to his natural colour, leave the make up and wear a generic outfit, he would not be comfortable. Hopefully this clear that up for some people.",2020-11-02 23:16:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jmyqdl/aita_for_slut_shaming_my_son/,827,2083,0.83,1
203,YTA,"AITA for getting rid of a ""gift"" that my sons partner bought him?","I am at a complete loss right now. Apologies for any formatting errors, I literally only created my account to ask for help.

My son (18) stays at home with me and his three siblings (15F, 11M & 9M). We have had a difficult relationship to say the least. I'll call him Max for the sake of this post. Max suffers with some pretty prominent hypersexuality. As soon as he was legal, he started sleeping around with various individuals, most of them being a fair bit older than he was. Naturally I was worried about him so I took him to get checked for STD's, made him delete the contacts of everyone he'd been meeting up with and got my cousin (a therapist) to have a bit of a chat with him.

I had him install a tracking app in his phone and would check his room regularly. I do inspect all my kids bedrooms at least once or twice a week so he wasn't being singled out. Over time he seemed to settle down and even got himself a nice boyfriend who we'll call Adam. I was still wary and made sure that they stayed in the living room area where I could keep an eye on them as I didn't want Max going back to the way he was. They were a very sweet couple and I began to really like Adam, he was a good fit for my son.

However, last week, I got up a bit earlier than usual and decided to have a movie day with the kids, they'd all been doing their own thing lately and I wanted us to have some family time. When I started walking upstairs, near Max's room, I could hear him frantically running around and went to check on him. I asked him if he was okay and he shot me some stupid excuse about looking for clothes. I let it go for a bit and went to wake up his siblings.

I slipped away when everyone was downstairs watching tv and went to Max's room. It took a bit of searching but when I checked in his closet I found a ... well we'll just say an adults toy. I was absolutely mortified. I called him upstairs and questioned him about it. He looked embarrassed but I pushed him to tell me where he got it. He eventually spluttered out something about it being a ""gift"" from Adam. I really didn't know what to say. I grounded him and took his electronics away.

I also threw that thing out (Max was not pleased because it was a ""gift"" from his partner).

Max was absolutely distraught and after losing the argument to get his electronics back, has been giving me the silent treatment. He has refused to speak to me and will only talk to his siblings. I spoke to Max's dad and he thinks that what I did was out of line but my husband says I was 100% in the right, Max shouldn't have those sorts of adult toys in the house. Adam is not much better, he bought it in the first place even after knowing what Max is like.

I feel like I'm justified but my ex won't drop the subject and accused me of humiliating our son (I am his mother and we can be open and talk about anything). AITA?

(EDIT)

I went to bed and woke up with a bunch of YTA comments. I also received a lot of hateful DM's so thanks for that. I am not doing this to argue but I need to set something straight as a few people seem to think I diagnosed my son with hypersexuality. I did not. I'm just going to copy and paste one of my replies as I have to get back to work soon.

When Max was around 14/15 he started watching pornography a lot more than what is healthy at that age (as in staying up most of the night to watch it). When I put parental restrictions in place regarding the internet he resorted to watching shows with a lot of nudity etc. (e.g. Shameless). As soon as he hit legal age (16 in the UK) he started lying to me about study groups at school when in actual fact he was meeting up with total strangers to sleep with them (this would happen several times a week).

He even skipped school several times to meet up with these strangers. It was not safe. He would seek out sex whenever he needed emotional support or was just having a bad day instead of just talking to a friend or family member. The only good thing I can think if is that he seemed to always use protection at least.

I was worried for his safety and took him to several psychiatrists, some of which my ex husband (who I don't get along with) also helped to pick out. They all seemed to agree that Max's sexual behaviour was indeed hypersexuality and that it may be related to his anxiety and depression (two disorders they also diagnosed him with). We went to support groups (which Max was quick to want to drop out of) and he was given medication (which he sometimes refuses to take if he is having a bad day). 

I thought if he avoided sex for a while (like an addict going cold turkey) then he'd calm down a bit but apparently that hasn't worked.

204,YTA,AITA for telling my fiancé that her “ fit mom” post on Instagram is embarrassing?,"My fiancé (40) and I (40M) have been engaged for 11 years and together for 16. 

A year ago, she gave birth to our daughter. Don’t get me wrong- I was excited to have a baby on the way and I wanted to have kids. My parents were also so happy about their first granddaughter. 

However after giving birth my fiance turned into a neurotic mess of a person. And 90 percent of that was due to her body. Her body seemed to have undergone a massive meltdown of sorts and I certainly wasn’t prepared for it.

I was fat in middle school so I have stretch marks but my wife’s pretty much encompassed her whole body. 

She also would repeat annoying phrases to friends like “ my stomach is squishy but our daughter loves it because I’m Mama” or “ I’m perfect in her eyes” In the same breath she complains that her skin looked like a melted candle and it’s honestly too much to bear for me. 

She says that she can’t imagine trying on wedding gowns and for the moment I’m just secretly relieved because she’s impossible to deal with and the last thing I want to do is plan a wedding. 

She’s since started spamming everybody’s Instagram feed with fitness journey videos. My sister and her college friends came home one weekend and were scrolling through her posts and saying the captions she writes is just desperate but I’ve bit my tongue so far.

But yesterday she posted a close up of her stretch marks with the really second hand embarrassment inducing captions to the affect of “ I’m proud of my tiger stripes.”

It got a bunch of likes and comments but honestly I think people just thought it was the acceptable way to react. The pictures were also pretty close up.

I confronted my fiancé  and asked if she’d consider taking it down because it’s just a set of really unattractive pictures. I honestly had to look away and I’m sure our friends who follow her might had that gut reaction too.

She started a long tirade about how strong her body was and how amazing it was as if she was the only woman who’s ever given birth. I finally stopped her and said it was an embarrassing post and walked away.

AITA? Now I caught her complaining about giving her best years to me and a bunch of other stuff over text to her friends.",2020-11-05 12:58:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/joiblm/aita_for_telling_my_fiancé_that_her_fit_mom_post/,734,1815,0.85,2
205,YTA,AITA for expecting my girlfriend to do the housework,"My (27m) girlfriend (25f) has been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome for three months now. She had to switch from full time work to part time due to her condition. I work a very demanding job with long hours.

 Every time I come home barely any of the housework is done which is frustrating because by the time I finish work, I’m probably almost as exhausted as my girlfriend. I’ve already told her that I’ll do more of the physical stuff like mowing the lawn and vacuuming etc. But considering she only works part time I feel like it’s her responsibility to clean the house, do the laundry etc. 

I told her how I felt about the situation and she got upset with me and said that i “obviously don’t understand cfs” and then she locked herself in the bedroom.

206,YTA,AITA for telling my daughter I hate her career.,"Hello everyone.  Bare with me as this is the first time I have ever posted. My younger daughter suggested and showed me how to get onto this site.

So here is the problem.  My oldest daughter has been a flight attendant for 22 years and have been with the same airline that whole time.  This marks the 22 year in a row that we have not been able to spend any holidays with her either.  This was her dream job and she was so excited when she got the interview and hired and made it through training.  We knew at the beginning that she was going to miss some holidays as she got settled in but now she is pretty high up in seniority.

I called her the other day to tell her about our Thanksgiving times and she said that she signed up to take that time since it would be holiday pay and over time.  I was not happy with this and told her that she needs to stop putting her career and job over family.  I told her that it would be nice if for once she would actually spend some with us during the holidays. In turn she told me she was doing this for her future.  She was trying to desperately get her condo paid off so that she didn't have that big payment hanging over her head.  I got mad and told her to do what she thought was right.

So the question is. Am I the asshole for wanting to spend time with my daughter and enjoy the holidays with my entire family?

&#x200B;

Additional info:

She is so much different from us.  She always has been.  We live out in the country in the middle of nowhere.  We are blue collar.  My husband works in a factory and I in an office.  Both of my other kids are happy with this kind of life but she has always wanted more. She went to college and got a degree while she waited to hit the age she needed to apply for her job. She lives two hours away from us and comes home if we are lucky every other month for a day or two and then hurries and just goes right back. We go see her for a couple of days on the off month.

I have hated her job since 9/11. Maybe now it's irrational but I have always had a fear of losing her since that time.  That time was the worst.  We didn't hear from her for three days.  We kept waiting to have someone show at our house to give us news we feared. I have told her this a million times over but she constantly tells me I'm safe. I get that she is happy and loves what she does.  But I feel that she just refuses to find any kind of balance in her life.

Edit.

A lot of you are asking why we can't just reschedule.  We have.  On many occasions we have tried to reschedule many times and all we get is Sorry I gotta work.  Sorry I gotta work.  Sorry I gotta work. So it's not like we don't try.  I did show my husband this post and he is laughing and so am I at this point.  We both decided that at this point we just need to be done.  She is going to do what she wants. You all are right.  Twenty-Two years of this.  I should be used to it at this point. We decided to try  something to prove my point.  We are just not going to contact her .  Lets see how long it takes to see if she realizes that we aren't talking  or visiting. And if we don't hear from her for a while then I guess she is just happier without us. I'll give her her space.",2020-11-16 18:39:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jvc9wk/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_i_hate_her_career/,357,1041,0.91,1
207,YTA,AITA for not helping more with Thanksgiving?,"Me (31M) and my wife (29F) had a baby 7 months ago. My parents came to us for Thanksgiving dinner this year. My wife made a great spread. As we were about to eat, the baby started fussing, he has been teething. I told my wife she should go attend to him, but she asked if I would, because she hadn’t eaten all day because she was trying to care for the baby, cook everything and try to visit with my parents and she would really like a warm meal since it had been a while since she had one. I said it would be really rude to my parents to sit down without me, since in my family the hosting family member was always at the table with the guests. My wife asked me again to please go, but I was annoyed and said no. I could tell my wife was irritated, but she went to our baby.

I was thinking we’d wait for her to return, but my dad said he was starving and everything looked fantastic, so I told them to dig in. My wife seemed to be having a hard time getting our son to settle down, but she’s always had the magic touch when it comes to him, so I left her to it. By the time he was content and quiet again, we’d finished and we had moved into the other room. I had left everything on the table and when I went back around she was feeding the baby. I said she should probably clean up once she was done, and she really coldly asked when exactly she was supposed to eat. I was taken by surprise and asked what she was on about, and she told me she still hadn’t eaten anything and I had left a mess instead of at least taking the used dishes to the sink and she knew it was to much to think I’d actually bothered to make her a plate too. 

I got irritated and told her that she was being dramatic and that we were hosting and I thought it was more important to spend time with my parents. She said, I was the one who invited my parents over, but I left her to do everything. I said that wasn’t true, but she asked me to name just one thing I’d done to help her. I was put on the spot and couldn’t think of something, so she said exactly. I got pretty angry, but my mom came in then and asked if she could feed the baby. My wife said yes, then started making herself a plate so she could eat. My mom was upset with me when she realized that my wife still hadn’t eaten. So now my wife and my mom are pissed at me, and I’m still trying to figure out how exactly I’m the asshole for making sure my parents were attended to since we had them over.",2020-11-28 03:35:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k2gagr/aita_for_not_helping_more_with_thanksgiving/,295,331,0.69,2
208,YTA,AITA for telling my father’s wife that she is nothing to me besides my that?,"My mother died when I (25F) was 19 and my sisters were 16 and 15. I have no words to explain the pain. For the first few months I wanted to actually die. Had to stop college because I couldn’t get out of my bed. Therapy helped. I still have bad days but I guess life goes on.  

After me, my therapist and dad all agreed I was well enough I went back to college. College was three hours away by plane so I didn’t go home much. Still talk to my father and sisters daily. 

2 years after my mom died my dad met a woman I will call Lily. They started dating and got married 2 years later. My sisters tell me she is nice. They had a few problems in the beginning when she tried to parent them which was not well received by a 18 and a 17 year old. They both felt (and I agreed) that my parents had already raised us and her input was not necessary or wanted (specially since a few things she tried were different from the way mom and dad raised us). They told dad and he told Lily firmly but politely that he was the parent and he would make the decisions where me and my sisters were concerned. No more problems after that.       

But I just couldn’t. For me Lily is just a walking, talking reminder my mom is gone. I know it’s not fair to her but I just can’t, really. Talked with my therapist and dad. Explained. He told Lily that while I wish her all the best, I'm not open to the idea of a relationship with her. She seemed to understand. 

I barely hear anything about her nowadays. Only when my sisters really want to say something to me and there is no way not to include her. When I go home I stay with my grandparents and if she is joining us for something I suddenly have plans with old friends, sorry. My dad and sisters only visited me once, when I graduated. Could only invite a certain number of people and I have a big family besides my dad and sisters. They took priority so she did not go.

Basically, I haven’t met Lily in the four years she and dad have been together. Never even talked to her. Dad understands and the rest of my family or understands or doesn’t care. 

Well, last week I got a call from an unknown number. It was Lily. She was clearly upset. Said it has been years and that she is a part of my dad’s life and I was selfish for excluding her from one of the three most important things for him (me and my sisters). She said she wants to at least be my friend. Went on and on about not being fair to her that I don’t want anything to do with her. 

When I finally got to talk I was a mess so I only said “You are a part of my dad’s life, yes. You are his wife. And that’s all you are to me. I’m sorry but I have no interest in meeting you or talking to you again. Bye.” Finished the call and went to sleep. Slept for 14 hours.  

Apparently, she is unconsolable. Told my dad what happened. He didn’t know she would call. Dad is upset but understands. My boyfriend says I was completely in the right. But Lily absolutely thinks I’m the asshole. AITA, reddit?",2020-11-12 06:48:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jsq0dl/aita_for_telling_my_fathers_wife_that_she_is/,481,1084,0.94,1
209,YTA,AITA for telling my sister to tell her children to talk properly?,"Hi all. 

My sister, her husband and their son and daughter came to visit us for dinner yesterday where we had a bit of a disagreement. 

When we were growing up, our parents always taught us to speak properly and dress nicely, and their advice has been very helpful. We both got into top universities (sister went to Oxford) and now have great careers. Her husband is very working class and from the North of England, which is where they live now. 

Sister and I were both privately educated, but she and her husband chose to send their kids to a normal school. 

Their kids are 13 and 11, and have very thick accents. They don't swear or anything like that, but they do use a lot of regional slang, half of which I don't understand. 

As they were leaving, I had a word with my sister in private, saying that she should think about asking her kids to talk properly, that it will be a struggle for them later in life with strong accents and slang. 

My sister responded by asking what that was meant to mean, and said that how she chooses to parent her children is her business only. She didn't say goodbye and just left. 

I'm not sure how to feel about this. I feel like these kids - who are lovely, intelligent and well behaved - will miss out on a lot of opportunities because they aren't well spoken. My sister and I were both taught these lessons from a very early age, but she seems to have forgotten it all. 

I know it perhaps wasn't my place to make those comments but I think I did the right thing in the long run.",2020-10-24 10:09:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jh6ip3/aita_for_telling_my_sister_to_tell_her_children/,988,3324,0.88,5
210,YTA,AITA for telling my son to stop acting like a robot after he didn't congratulate me on my engagement?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I have four children

* Adam - 21m
* Jude - 17m
* Alexis - 8f
* Jake - 5m

Jude has always had difficulty when it came to emotions. He was never an overly affectionate child. At around 5 or 6 he started trying to wriggle out of hugs, avoided kisses and would complain of someone was too close to him. I accepted this as just how he was and compromised. Instead of a hug/kiss, I'd give him a high five or a fist bump. His siblings are all very affectionate so I don't know what happened with him.

He's not completely emotionless but it's often pretty hard to tell what he's thinking/feeling at any given moment. If he's mad he'll leave the room to be alone or just ignore whoever is making him mad. He'll smile if he's happy of course and I have seen him cry a few times, like when the family dog passed away, but most of the time he's like a complete robot. He doesn't tell us that he loves us or compliment us at all. When Alexis did took part in her first school play, Jude gave her a high five after the show but he didn't *say* anything.

It bothers me but I have kept my mouth shut because overall Jude is a good boy. He's never hurt anyone, he does well in school and at his part time job (before covid hit) and never hesitates to help me around the house. But it just gets to me that he acts so emotionless all the time. It's like living with a cyborg.

So, two nights ago, my partner proposed to me. I was absolutely overjoyed and couldn't wait to tell the kids. I called them all down and let them know. All of them were thrilled and I was hugged and congratulated by each of them.

Except Jude.

He hung back a little bit before giving me a pat of the arm and saying ""that's great"". Now I know it was genuine. He smiled at me and I know if my boy is lying. But I was absolutely devastated. I had accepted the fact that Jude is not one for feelings but I had just hoped for once that he'd get over it and just congratulate me for once, give me a hug and act genuinely excited about the wedding. I couldn't help myself and I burst into tears and asked him why he couldn't just once act like a normal human being. Why he couldn't stop acting like a robot for once in his life.

It had come out before I even realised what I'd said. Jude just stood there in shock for a second before heading off to his bedroom and locking the door. I do feel sort of like TA here as Jude is a kind soul. He doesn't tell his siblings that he loves them but he makes up for it by showing them that he loves them (buying them presents he knows they'll like, helping them with their homework, helping them make costumes for Halloween etc.). But I also feel like he should be trying to get over this emotionless phase, he's 17 after all, he knows his behaviour just isn't normal. My fiance agrees with me though he does feel like I could have been a bit less harsh.

211,YTA,AITA: daughter says I have no right to be concerned about her eating habits,"I (36M) am a father to a 17 year old girl. She's my oldest of three children.

Two years ago, my daughter had a problem with eating large quantities of food in one sitting. It got to the point where she was eating other people's food and we even had to lock our pantry for quite a while because she would eat just for the sake of it when she was bored. That lasted until she found the key to the lock we used and helped herself knowing our rules. 

She didn't have a weight problem per-se but she did have a delusion. She thought she was underweight but in reality her weight was perfectly normal to that of her age group. Admittedly she grew up hearing comments from extended family about how skinny she was as a child, and she went on thinking she was still underweight in her teenage years despite having caught up.

One day we got into an argument about how much she ate and I made the decision to put her on a diet. Nothing major, just reducing how much she ate. I thought it was quite fair to say that she was to only eat three times a day. Breakfast, lunch and dinner. If we had pudding or something of the sort she would also be allowed to have a small snack after dinner.

This obviously started a heated argument, with her demanding to know why I was doing this and me saying that it was out of control and that she could end up gaining an unhealthy amount of weight. She responded by saying she was only 120 lbs, and without thinking I told her that when I was her age that was considered a bit big for a girl.

Fast forward two years later. Lately she's not been eating more than once a day and she waits until 10 PM to eat anything. She's definitely hungry before then but during a conversation with a friend she let it slip that she chews gum to minimize her stomach pain. Her weight has also dropped to only 110 lbs.

I grew concerned, and I told her it worried me how she was going about eating. She snapped immediately, called me an asshole and told me it's my fault because what I said to her two years ago had apparently stuck with her and then said since I'm the problem, I have no right to try to intervene. 

I told her I think it is incredibly unfair and manipulative for her to blame me for her own troubles with food. I told her I was sorry that she interpreted what I said as her needing to starve herself but that she needs to start taking responsibility for her own decisions.

My wife disagrees with me and basically has the mentality of ""you reap what you sow"" but I read that someone using a scapegoat for their eating disorder is very common and in that case the scapegoat happened to be me.

212,YTA,AITA for letting my girlfriend out of the car after she asked me to?,"Short backstory: I (21M) have been with my girlfriend (19F) for 1.5 years. We live together. Once a month, she goes to her workplace's second location, which is about an hour away in a different city. 

Yesterday, I went to pick her up from work after her evening shift. She was going to take the bus, but called at the last minute to see if I could come get her because she was tired, and because it was dark out. 

When she got in the car, I made a joke about how she looked like a mess. I thought it was obvious that I was joking, but she got upset at me for saying it. We started to argue, so I said something along the lines of ""I didn't even get a thank you for going out of my way to come pick you up.""

My girlfriend responded with ""Fine, let me out at the next bus station, I'll take the bus instead."" I ignored her, but she kept repeating herself, so I pulled over on the side of the highway and told her to get out. 

She said she wasn't going to get out on the highway (not a real highway, just a long road that connects the cities), but I told her if she wanted to get out of the car so badly, she could get out here. She just stared at me and only got out once I started yelling. I pulled away and drove to the next bus station to wait for her, because I just wanted to teach her a lesson.

The station was a 15 minute walk, max. After 20 minutes of waiting she still hadn't gotten there, so I called her to make sure she was okay. She started crying on the phone and told me she had called a friend (who lives in the other city) to come pick her up, and that she was staying with her for the night. I tried to talk to her but she hung up. 

I drove out to pick her up this morning and we had a completely silent car ride. Once we got home, she called me an asshole and locked herself in our bedroom. She eventually came out and we fought over this. She said I'm a shitty person for stranding her on the side of the highway at night, and I told her she was the one who asked to get out of the car in the first place.

213,YTA,AITA for not giving up my seat to a pregnant woman?,"This happened just last night, and my family completely lost their minds at me about it. So here I am.

I take the bus to and from work (car got totaled about a month ago, still waiting on insurance to reimburse me so I can get a new one), and right now on public transit you have to social distance. This means limited seating.

At my job, I’m literally on my feet all day, and I work 10 hour shifts. It sucks but the pay is good, so I can deal, but after a long day, my feet are sore AF. I genuinely cherish the time I spend sitting on the bus ride home, knowing I have to walk another 15-20 minutes to my house from the bus stop. Which means more time on my feet.

So last night I’m on the bus, and a very heavily pregnant lady gets on. She looks around for a seat, only to find there are no available ones left. I’m the closest to her, so she starts giving me the imploring eyes. I had my headphones on and tried to pretend I couldn’t see her, but once she started talking to me it became inevitable. 

I wasn’t rude or anything, I just told her no, I’ve had a long day and my feet are sore. I don’t want to give up my seat. She started crying about how she’s a pregnant single mom, and I told her I’m sorry, but that was her personal choice and she can’t expect other people to accommodate her life choices. We live in a state where birth control and abortions are free, so I don’t know why this should be my problem. It’s not my fault she decided to have a baby when she can’t afford a car.

After going back and forth for a bit, an old man finally shouted that I’m a “worthless punk” and offered his seat to the lady. He started ranting and raving about the “damn millennials” and I just looked the other way and pretended I didn’t hear it. As they were trading seats, the bus driver had to slam the brakes for whatever reason, and the pregnant lady and the old man both fell. They started yelling at me, calling me all sorts of nasty names, but I just looked the other way and ignored it.

When I got home and told my sister, she flipped the fuck out and went crying to our parents, who also chewed my ass out. But I was tired and had a long day, and I don’t know why we need to keep perpetuating the idea that breeding somehow means your entitled to people’s seats.

I have a sister who has a horrible drug problem. She's a horrible burden on everyone and i think she's beyond help. She's went through rehab and everything. It's to the point where you almost never see her sober anymore. She lives with me and has no job whatsoever.

It seems like once a week, she'll go get wasted on pills and come back to the house and pass out. Same story last week, only that we had to call an ambulance and after she got home from the hospita, she promised she'd change. I was proud, until she came back with the same thing just a few days later. She came in mumbling, her eyes glazed over and sure enough, she passed out on her bed.

Nobody knows the real her. So, i was pretty angry about it, the way she lied to us all about changing. And disappointed, so i took a picture of her passed out and put it on Facebook. Her friends saw it, the commenters were all horrified. Sure enough, when she woke up, she got really angry and started airing all my dirty laundry on Facebook too. Mostly made up stuff and nobody believed her.

I know it was extreme, but was it justified? Because we've done literally everything we can do to help her. I've even gotten her a job which she blew off after a day.

For those in the extreme minority that said NTA, read the YTA comments and you should be easily swayed. 

Happened this morning. I (37M) am having a problem with my Internet and broadband, so I call the help desk and am going through the necessary checks when the call worker baffled me.

Now for context, my name is similar to Thomas Ryefield but I go as Tom, and you'll struggle to find someone with my surname unless we are related

The worker is asking me questions and asks me to confirm my name, to which I do and she says its wrong and doesn't match the account. I ask is she sure, she checks it again and says its wrong, and that I'll have to go to my account to update my details.

I'm completely baffled now as I've called a couple of times earlier this week. 

EDIT: We go back and forth checking but still no joy. 

Before I go and change my details, I check a final time:

""Is the surname on your record Ryefield?""

Yes, she says.

""Is the first name Thomas?""

No, she says.

""Is it a short form of my first name?""

No, she says.

""So it's not Tom then?""

Yes that's correct, thanks for confirming, she says. 

""Are you serious, Tom is the short form for Thomas!"" 

She tries to tell me that it's not, my own name! 

EDIT: There was no yelling involved. 
EDIT: she argued with me about my own name saying that the short form of my name is not the short form of my name.
EDIT: Subsequent staff had no issues accepting the short form of my name, she did not know that the short form of my name is the short form of my name.

216,YTA,AITA for telling my wife I wish she would take care of herself like her friends do?,"6 years ago I met my now wife and we hit it off. We had all the same interest, same views, same goals in life. The only issue we had was how we felt about each other's appearance. I don't need a woman who hides herself with make up, in fact I oppose that, but I do like my woman to have her hair managed and does dress up a little when we go on dates. Now my then girlfriend wasn't like that - she had a masculine sense of fashion and let her frizzy hair wayward. After our talk we set some ground rules - we weren't going to change our appearances for one another, but there were factors we take into consideration; she liked a well trimmed beard and certain length hair cut so I made sure to maintain those things. I asked she put some effort into how she dressed on our date. I never said it had to be a dress, but just a nice blouse.

8 months in of dating we almost broke up because while I fulfilled my end of the bargain, she never did. I explained I didn't want her to be uncomfortable and what I want shouldn't come before that, so it was best we split. She decided she loved me and put in more of an effort.

We get married, move in together and life gets rolling. But as it does she went back into her old ways of never dressing up or managing her hair. I still keep my beard trim the way she likes it, along with my hair cut. When I mentioned it to her she shrugs and says, 'we're married now, it doesn't matter'. To me it does.

She has 2 close friends - both wives and moms too. Whenever I see them they're both dressed nicely and cleaned up. They invite my wife to get her hair trimmed with them or attend a yoga class but she always say no, she's pretty enough she doesn't need those things. It frustrates me. Yesterday she was mocking her friend for getting highlights in her hair, saying it was ridiculous and unnatural, and I snapped back I wish she would take care of herself like her friends do. She left for her parents, both who are blowing up my phone now and trying to get me to bring our son over.

218,YTA,AITA for refusing to make my wife a custom rocking chair to commemorate our baby's birth?,"The real issue here is that I've done it for some friends and family members but won't do it for our baby. The reason why I am refusing is because I don't love doing it. I did it as a favor once and then it led to other people asking me to make them one to commemorate their baby's birth. I felt bad about saying no so I've always agreed if they're a close friend or family member. 

My wife just assumed I would make one now that she's pregnant, but I told her that I wouldn't this time because I hate these projects and have enough going on as is. They take away from other things I'd rather be doing instead, and it's tedious work that I don't enjoy. 

She didn't like my answer and thinks I'm an asshole for being willing to do it for others but not her or our baby. She feels like it's a sign I'm not committed or don't value our baby enough. My logic is that since it's my baby I should not have to do a project I hate, but she does not see it that way.

219,YTA,AITA for telling my single mom sister she should get more realistic when it comes to her dating standards?,"For context: My older sister 32(f) is a single mother of two (7m and 5f) because her marriage ended after 4 years. He is still around and pays child, but she's mostly raising the kids on her own.

She has been single for quite some time and recently tried to start dating again. My sister thinks of herself as a 'good catch' (college degree, well traveled, good job, above average looking) but after spending the last year not having much luck with dating she's getting frustrated. According to her only losers with credit card debt or a marijuana addiction are interested in her, and she asked me for a 'guy's opinion'. 

I told her she should get more realistic when it comes to her dating standards. While she has a lot of things going for her most guys don't want to date single moms. It’s not that it’s her fault, but there’s a host of shit a guy can end up having to deal with, like the ex being a fixture in your life, the kid giving you shit about not being their real dad, you not being her first priority, etc. 

My sister got bitter over this and hung up on me and is not returning my texts and calls.

220,YTA,AITA for laughing at my wife when she suggested I don’t do enough for my son? I literally pay for everything he owns.,"My wife(26) and I (M29) had our first son about 10 months ago. Because childcare is costly in my area, along with the obvious risks regarding daycares, we agreed that she’d be a SAHM. So i picked up more hours at work. I work the graveyard shift in a warehouse 12hrs a day Sunday night through Thursday night, and 6-8hrs on Friday night. For a grand total of 66-68hrs a week. 

By the time i come home in the morning my wife and son are both up and shes making breakfast for us while feeding our son. I’ll usually take my food into our bedroom and eat in there before winding down for bed. But I usually don’t fall asleep until around noon. So I don’t get much sleep.

Recently however she started bringing our son into the room with and asking me to play with him or give him a bottle and a change before i go to sleep. But i thought thats what she was for considering all she does is take care of him. Id do it usually but it’s been really irking me.

This morning it got heated when she tried to hand me my son as im getting ready to fall asleep. She said that i needed to “step up more as a father.” I laughed and pointed around and said “well im paying for this house we’re living in, the clothes our son is wearing. The formula and water that he eats and his baby food. We agreed that you’d do the house stuff, why is it now my responsibility and why right before im going to bed?!” 

She didn’t say anything and just took our son into his room and locked the door. I texted my mom and she started reaming me out. But honestly this was our original agreement so I don’t see a problem. This is extremely frustrating and i think i need someone from the outside to give me a perspective. 

AITA for laughing at my wife when she asked me to watch our son AS IM ABOUT TO GO TO BED?


Update: i wrote this post right before going to sleep, and i picked it back up about an hour ago. I am definitely an asshole here, i was tired as was she and i lashed out. She doesn’t deserve that. I showed my wife this post. She’s having a great time reading all the YTA comments. Im going to start eating breakfast with my family, theres obviously a lot i need to improve.

222,YTA,AITA for abandoning my girlfriend on top of a mountain?,"I know this sounds bad but hear me out on this one. It wasn't even a big mountain. Basically I've been going on hikes alone on weekend mornings while my girlfriend eats pancakes.

On Sunday I went to do a peak that's easy if you're a vet like me but still takes a few hours. I went early so I could be back for the football game at one. I could not miss this game. So I woke up early to go and my girlfriend gets up with me and is like ""Let's do it"" and I was like what. She gives me this whole spiel about trying to better herself and her body which she gives me every year but I still felt obligated to bring her along.

Before I agreed I made sure she understood that it would be challenging and that I was going to be going at a brisk pace because I needed to be home in time for the game. I told her that if she wanted we could do some lighter hikes later this week so she can ease her self into it but she insisted she could keep up.

But of course it didn't go that way. She fell behind immediately, before the real ascent even began. I offered to turn around and tackle it another time but she insisted she just needed to adjust to the altitude change. Nope. It took us over two hours to get up, and she complained and begged for water the entire time.

We got to the top and I told her we needed to get down faster than we went up because if we didn't I was going to miss kickoff. She got all pissy over that and was like isn't spending time with me more important than the game. I knew this was bait so I just said back that I told her the conditions beforehand and it wasn't respectful of her to slow me down like this. Then she got real mad and basically shrieked across the entire peak that I might as well just leave her up there and I was so angered and embarrassed by her that I did.

I told her the descent down was easier and there were plenty of people around to help her if she needed it and I headed back down the mountain alone. I felt bad so I waited for her in the car and watched the game on my phone and she didn't make it down until the 4th quarter which I pointed out to her as soon as she opened the door. She won't talk to me. I know my actions were hurtful, but her peak freakout had humiliated me and I didn't know what else to do. AITA?

223,YTA,AITA for going off on my SIL because of the way she talks about her *possibly* autistic daughter?,"I’ve been debating on making this post for a while. But the dust has settled and everyone is acting like IM the asshole. So honestly, a bit of a validation post. 

My sister in law has two children, a girl 
that’s 18m and a boy that’s 6m. This post is in regard to the girl. She doesn’t speak. At all. She babbles, but mostly makes pterodactyl noises to communicate. 

Recently, we were all planning thanksgiving and my niece was running around in the back ground. Side note - her nickname is Baby Bird because she flaps her hands like little wings while she’s running and playing. Somebody made a comment I didn’t quite catch but it was about something my niece was doing and my SIL shrugged and passively said, “well, she might be autistic. This was the first time that had ever been mentioned and of course we all had questions. SIL said when she took the baby for her checkup, the pediatrician said she was showing signs of what may be autism. I asked her how she felt and if she was okay, and she laughed and said, “It’s a nonissue. We always knew she was a bit throwed off, we just have a name for it now!” 

Everyone laughed and I asked her what she meant by that. She described all the “autistic tendencies” (her words not mine), and said she didn’t care, she wouldn’t treat or love her any differently. I told her that was a horrible way to talk about her daughter. Everyone got quiet and just stared at me, and my husband was giving me a look like he wished a hole in the earth would swallow me. But I kept on. I told her she can’t treat her the same way, because she’ll have special needs and won’t function the same as other kids. I told her, she’s not “throwed off. She’s autistic.” 

My SIL stared at me for a moment, and then said, “thanks for that, Melanie Barnett” (which??? Wtf even is that???” And then left. My mother in law went off on me, my other sister in law told me I was doing too much, and my husband just looks like I’m a disappointment and barely speaks to me. Wtf?! How am I an asshole???

She must think I’m not attracted to her either. She has a friend who said she would give my wife a discount if she wanted boudoir photos done. My wife went ahead and did them. 

Yesterday she “surprised” me with the results of them, saying she hopes this “ helps.”

I frankly don’t think boudoir photos make her any more or less flattering and a quick glance at them did nothing for me. 

She kept trying to get me to take them and I finally put the pictures on the couch behind us and told her to stop being desperate and that there’s other ways to deal with a mid life crisis if that’s what she’s having.

227,YTA,AITA for giving my oldest child the smallest bedroom 20 years ago?,"At the time of this incident, I (50F) was 32, my oldest Sam was F12 (first marriage), middle April F6, and youngest Darren M4 (second). We moved into a house with 4 bedrooms: upstairs, large master and medium-ish bedroom, main level, large and small bedroom. The small bedroom was in the back corner of the house, and since April had a quiet voice we wanted her where we could hear her easily. Sam didn’t want the small bedroom (it was quite small) and thought this was unfair as she was much older, so we compromised by turning the small bedroom into an office. The girls shared a room. April was easily heard and Sam was only with me on weekends so it didn’t even make sense for her to take up a whole room all the time.

Sam was unhappy with this arrangement from the get-go. It didn’t help that she kept butting heads with her sister. April would push buttons, Sam would react, and it would turn into a sobbing mess. April, being six, would also sometimes make kid mistakes like doodling in Sam’s books, and this would cause Sam to melt down even when I tried to fix it. Sam complained that April had a larger bed than her. We had gotten a bunk bed for the room, and April was safer on the bottom bunk as she could have fallen out of the top. So Sam had the top bunk, which was smaller than the bottom. Also, again, she was only there on weekends.

I explained the reasons over and over again: she wasn’t here enough to warrant taking away my office, and I needed to be able to hear April. I told her if she spoke to her dad and started living with me during the week, we could turn the office into a bedroom. She agreed, after many of these discussions, and came to live with me. She got the small room and boom, angry again. She expected the big room. She never told me but I learned she was also angry as her (very high quality!) mattress sat on the floor for a while. It was a very good mattress and a frame would have taken up valuable space. She stayed with me for about two years before going back to her dad’s pretty much full time. No matter what I did she wasn't happy.

I haven’t heard from her in a couple years. We had a big fight. She wouldn’t tell me why she was so cold with me all the time, then she stopped talking to me. I found an old journal she’d forgotten at my house a few years back and I hadn’t read it, but very recently I missed her so much, I did. There was a lot, mostly rants and notes and some journal-type stuff. She wrote a rant about how I’d used a bedroom to “manipulate” her into living with me, how awful it was, and how it felt like a prison cell with “just a chunk of foam on the floor to lie on and a little desk in the corner.” She makes it sound like I tortured her with an expensive mattress and her own room, which I didn’t even need to give her. Lots of siblings have to share rooms for years.

I’m close to the limit so I guess now I just need to ask: AITA? Did I go too far in not giving her the room she wanted?",2020-11-18 22:27:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jwpz5t/aita_for_giving_my_oldest_child_the_smallest/,412,411,0.83,0
228,YTA,AITA for not saving all the money meant for my son as his college fund?,"My husband H and I (37M and 36F) have a son S (18M). H and I had only been on a few dates when I got pregnant. We were both childfree and I’m about to tell you why we kept S despite this.

H was going to split the cost of an abortion with me, but had to ask his mom for the money. You see, our parents respected our decision to be childfree, but we were their only kids and hopes at grandchildren. Basically H’s mom wanted a grandchild and so did my parents, who wouldn’t help me with the abortion fees but were willing to front a bunch of money for their future grandkid.

The money they were offering would have helped H and I pay off student loans and then had some change. And our parents were willing to help out with the kid while we finished college. So we took my parents’ money and had S, who was raised by his grandparents his first 4 years while we went to school.

When H and I graduated, we got decent jobs but couldn’t afford to live in a safe enough neighborhood. We had to use my parents’ money to be able to afford a big enough apartment in a nice safe area where S had other kids to play with too.

S had a decent childhood and H and I do love him but we’re depressed because we haven’t had our lives to ourselves. We literally only had this kid because of the payout. But we do our best to make sure he can’t pick up on it.

S graduated high school this year and plans to start college when the world is less shitty. He spent this past weekend at my parents’. They apparently told him about the money they gave H and I intended for him and he got all excited about his college fund.

The thing is, there’s only a few thousand of it left. It’s of course all his and we wouldn’t dream of touching it. But it’s not enough to cover his whole college. He flipped out when we explained this to him.

He began to scream at us for squandering his college fund and said we had no right. But we didn’t “squander” it. We used it on our debt, a big enough and safe place to stay, and some pricey extracurriculars he insisted on taking as a kid. We had to use that money to give him a stable childhood. We didn’t want to raise the kid while penny pinching and living in an unsafe environment.

Now my parents are starting to yell at me for wasting their money. But there was never a verbal or written agreement that the money was his college fund. It was “for him” and we used it to give him his secure childhood.

Are we assholes for not saving all of the money for when he went to college?

229,YTA,AITA for “ruining” my daughter’s graduation?,"
This happened a few years ago and it recently came up again. I don’t think I was TA here but I’ll let a collective third party judge. 

My daughter was set to graduate college and wasn’t too excited about attending her graduation. I thought this was unfair because I paid for her college and graduation is supposed to be fun and a chance to let loved ones celebrate too. So she agreed after I made that argument. 

A few weeks in advance, my daughter asked if I had invited anyone to her graduation because she wanted to go to a certain restaurant afterwards and they apparently book fast. I told her I only invited a couple of the neighbors and our family friends. 

The day of her graduation, we all went to the venue and waited for the ceremony to begin. After it did, I called my daughter asking if she could see me in the bleachers, and even waved so she could see me. I asked her to wave back but I couldn’t see her do so and she wouldn’t stay on the phone. 

After the ceremony, I had to call her multiple times because everyone there wanted to congratulate her. I saw her taking pictures with her friends I never liked and told her to hurry up because it’s rude to ignore your guests.

When she finally joined us, she saw there were more people than she booked a table for. She called the restaurant and they told her they couldn’t accommodate extra people, causing her to cancel her reservation. 

I immediately suggested another place which I knew had vegetarian options because all of us except my daughter are vegetarian. What if that place had limited vegetarian options?

We all went out to eat at the place I suggested and went home. That day was never spoken of again until recently. My younger daughter graduated over the spring but for obvious reasons, she didn’t get a graduation ceremony. The older one immediately said she’d trade if she could because it was a shitty day. 

I immediately asked her why she thought that and she snapped at me. She said she only went to her graduation because it was on Mother’s Day and it made me happy. And that the whole day was me calling the shots and blowing up her phone from start to finish. 

She also said she knew I was in the bleachers and she couldn’t just stand up and wave in the middle of the ceremony, that she at least wanted to take some pictures with her friends but I rushed her out of doing that, and deliberately schemed to make sure we went to the same place I always want to go to, whose dishes I make at home every day.

I told her that we, her family, cared more about her than her friends, and that she ended up going to the other restaurant with her friends for her birthday a few months later so it’s not like we prevented her from ever going to that restaurant. I also reminded her that her guests were vegetarians and asked what if they didn’t have any vegetarian options at her restaurant.

She said she didn’t want to argue over what’s already happened and left the room. So Reddit, who’s TA here?",2020-10-14 15:40:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jb32aj/aita_for_ruining_my_daughters_graduation/,1361,3149,0.88,6

231,YTA,"AITA for telling another employee the reason people don't like her is that she behaves like a walking, talking, Reddit-y Meme Page?","I feel kind of bad for this, but I don't know if I should. Lori came to work for us during WFH. No one got to know her other than the brief online introductions and things shared in the group chats. She was pretty funny in the group chats, but I noticed a trend.

Lori parrots everything you expect to see on Reddit pages, Tumblr, and FB. It's hard to explain, but stuff like ""Oatmeal raisin cookies are the reason I have trust issues"" and ""I don't trust people who don't like dogs"" and all that doggo pupper goo goo ga ga pibble wibble woo woo shit, even older, dated stuff like Epic Fail or But I am Le Tired? It's all she would say. 

Once we transitioned to being back in the office, I figured hey, I'm excited to get to know this woman because she must be different IRL. She's actually worse because while you expect some of the things Redditors or other ""online people"" say when you're online, in person it's just... awkward.

For example, when we were chatting in the break room (distanced, of course), she was showing pictures of her dog to people and she kept saying ""I don't trust people who don't LOVE dogs. Look at my doggo! He's such a good little pupper!"" and people were looking at her like... uh, okay. She turned to someone else and asked about their pets and the girl said ""Oh, I have a cat, here's a pic-"" and Lori just repeated ""UGH, I just do NOT trust people who don't like dogs. Whoever said cats were the new dog is *seriously disturbed*.""

People started to avoid her. At one point she sat with me at lunch and talked about how she might look for a new job because the people at ours are ""weird"" and ""kind of mean.""

I said to her, ""Didn't you basically yell at Jenny because she has a cat? You went on some weird awkward rant about people who don't like dogs. You think that could be part of the issue?""

She got quiet and said ""Well there's something seriously disturbed about people who don't like dogs. It's not my fault. I don't make the rules. Why, did someone say something?""

232,YTA,AITA For making my girlfriend wear white to a wedding?,"My best friend and I are the type to always pull pranks on each other, it's just how our friendship formed and we always get a kick out of it.

For example, he once invited me to a party and told me to wear a costume and when I got there, it was normal attire. I laughed after the initial embarrassment, and like I said we are comfortable enough to do that to each other.

He held a wedding this past weekend, (socially distant, everyone was spread out and it was entirely outdoors). In the weeks leading up to the wedding, I told my girlfriend to wear white as it was expected all the women would wear it. She was reluctant but I told her that it was just a quirky thing the bridge and groom were doing, so she said ""ok"" and bought a white dress.

When we got to the wedding, it was standard wedding attire and my girlfriend was mortified. When my best friend saw what I had done, he was cracking up and joked ""I guess you two are getting married instead of us!""

The bride was pissed off and made a huge deal out of it. Normally she is really chill so I was surprised by her anger. My friend even tried to calm her down and told her it was just clothing and it doesn't change anything.

Now I feel incredibly bad by what happened. I really didn't think it was a big deal. I personally think this is being blown out of proportion but I don't know.",2020-09-28 20:32:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/j1k98w/aita_for_making_my_girlfriend_wear_white_to_a/,2306,7734,0.83,9
233,YTA,"AITA for mocking my boyfriend's ""Diet"".","My boyfriend is obese and diabetic. His doctor ordered him to change his diet and the only thing he actually changed was to wheat bread instead of white for his daily turkey sandwich and sweet n' low instead of sugar in tea. Which he drinks about 4 glasses of a day. That's it, he still eats burgers, fries, chicken nuggets, tacos, potatoes. And sweets. Lotsa sweets. He has some diet meals (Healthy Choice dinners) but gives into cravings a lot for the bad stuff, so they go unopened. 

But it's his choice, so i don't say much. He was out of wheat bread, so i'd pick some up while i was out. But since it was raining, i opted not to go at all. He didn't mind, but lunch time. He was looking for something to eat but there was no wheat bread. He couldn't find anything healthy, so i told him to just buckle down and eat the white bread for one day. He said something about cutting back. But i told him it's no different then the other junk food he eats.

And he got mad. He kinda grumbled at me how ""It's something he can feel good about that he cut back."" I told him maybe he should cut back on the cookies and tacos. He said the same thing about being proud and shouted he's ""TRYING TO CUT BACK!"" and i said ""Oh, you can't eat White bread. But you can scarf down burgers and baked potatoes and tacos, etc."" (I listed off all the bad food he's not supposed to eat, but does.) and he just shouted at me, he told me to shut up. But i continued and kept telling him the bad food he's not supposed to have ""I'm just saying, you still eat pizza and chips and pies""

He said he's doing his best and it's not easy. I told him ""I know about the oreos in your sock drawer.

234,YTA,AITA for choosing my niece(9f) over my fiancé's little sister (8f) to be flower girl?,"Our intended wedding date is July 2021, should everything go accordingly. 

The main tiff between the fiancé and I at the moment is the bridal party, well the flower girl. He's 29 but has a much younger, biological sister whose 8. Because of the difference they're relationship is more uncle and niece then brother and sister. 

I have a niece from my older sister, whose nine, but I'm a big sister to her.

Getting engaged, I knew right away my niece was going to be my flower girl. Whenever my fiancé and I drop by his parents, his little sister asks if she can be flower girl. It's a little awkward. I'm not close to her. Again, my fiancé isn't close to her. I joke she's going to need to fight my niece over that.

In August we had a get together with both his and mine family to announce the bridal party. His little sister was there and was super excited and announced to everyone she was going to be the flower girl. Again, I choose my niece. To make things a little more awkward, his little brother (11m) is the ring bearer. His sister obviously looked hurt after.

Since then my fiancé has received messages from both his mom and dad asking if we could find a spot for her in the wedding because she's feeling left out and her brother doesn't love her. He was comfortable with just my niece being flower girl, but now his opinion is turning because he's getting so frustrated with the messages. He's now saying we can have 2 flower girls but I don't want that in my wedding. I made a choice and would like him to stick up for me.

235,YTA,AITA for not asking my sister to transfer us our sons savings despite my girlfriends wishes/fears?,"throwaway because I don’t want friends reading this and judging us

My gf (24) and I (21M) had kids before we were financially stable, they were both oopsies and while we’re happy with our boys we struggle when unexpected expenses drop and we have no savings. 

My sister (29) raised my brother (16) and I and adopted us both, so don’t ask about my parents please. She and her husband send us money weekly and take our kids on a Fun Day once a month. They put aside some money for our sons adulthood, which I am ever so thankful for (they hold the saving accts.)

My gf has had issues with my sister since we announced we were expecting the first time. My sister has no poker face so it was obvious she was upset for a few hours despite her congratulations. I moved in with my gfs parents when I graduated and my son was born soon after so we had help, but GF expected sister to be more hands on. To this day gf thinks sister is trying to buy our sons love instead of taking care of them even half as often her parents do. I told her that wasn’t fair but it just starts an argument. 

More recently, my brother texted me “get your **nt gf back in line and raise your own failed pullouts” which is harsh for him. Turned out Gf had dropped the boys off at my sisters for a sleepover without asking and told her “to act like family”. TBH I don’t think gf told the full story coz later my sister called apologising for my childhood, she’s trying her best to keep me and my family happy and secure but she’s not Wonder Woman; she’s DONE raising other people’s kids (and my brother has been punished, a bit harshly imo). 

There’s tension coz my gf wants to cut contact with them coz of the text and call, but not before they transfer us our sons savings and agree to send the payments (her word) directly to us so they can’t be financially manipulative. I refuse: it’s beyond insulting, stupidly shortsighted, and I’m not cutting contact over this. 

My gf says it’s our kids money so we get final say in where it goes and we need it now so sister should respect that. I don’t want that, life isn’t lavish but our needs are met. I feel safer knowing my sister is saving for our sons futures: they’re putting in more money monthly than we could in 6. It’s self serving, I know that, but it’s true. But now gf calls my sister controlling and spiteful coz if she truly loved our sons and wanted what was best for them she would keep sending it even if we cut contact. 

I’m NOT cutting contact over teen angst that I chewed him out for and my sister shut down ASAP: I’ll ask for some distance but that’s it. Gf dropped it but is still asking for them to give us our sons savings. I’m scared of what backlash could be tbh, but gf is right, that money as an emergency fund would help us A LOT, we could breathe a bit easier at the end of the month, its the one thing her parents can’t help with. But it feels very wrong and dirty. 

So WIBTA for not asking (and hoping it calms down)?

Edit: ok the amount of negative comments is overwhelming. I get that my sister did a lot, but shouldn’t that make her more sympathetic to our situation? She has adhd and maybe autism, my gfs family are a lot more affectionate than she was, at least they say “I love you” almost daily. 

My sons are 3 and 1, they’re not the easiest ages to handle, some support from my side of the family would be nice, it’s always gfs family babysitting. I also don’t think my gf is toxic or entitled, just stressed and overwhelmed.

Edit 2: I wasn’t clear but the money likely comes from my sisters husband. He’s a coder, so he’s flushed, he moved her and my brother into his house, and she’s a waitress doing an online degree, so I don’t think she makes enough a ton? Also, she doesn’t want to be pregnant and her husband can’t have kids, so I think they’re childfree but not really because my brother calls him dad ? *and he’s always happy to see my kids, he’s always taking them to expensive places I know my sister can’t afford

**edit 3, probably final** the tide went from NTA to yta real fast. I feel like nothing here is straightforward and black and white. I feel like as much as I can appreciate my sister, I can feel sad that I missed out of the whole warm unconditionally loving nuclear family my gf had and introduced me to. They had a lot of questions about my sister and like I knew she wasn’t “normal”, but they seemed horrified at some of my stories? 

I know some (like having all 3 share a bed in a 1 bedroom apartment when she first “adopted” -it wasn’t legal yet she just snuck in, packed our bags and snuck us out) weren’t her fault per se, but it still made me realise that she did some shady stuff, she just always got lucky coz people pitied us. Even the landlord was nice about her having 2 kids im a 1 person rental and put a futon in there. And Like she used to steal food right? Then she got caught, and that dude set up her with an Italian restaurant (owned by the brother of the guy who caught her stealing!!) who gave her their leftovers, and even clothes the kids no longer wore, pads/tampons, toys for Xmas. It’s like she had her own private shelter and she even was a bridesmaid for that guys niece last year. Some real Oliver Twist shit I didn’t think actually happened irl. Even this one dealer would give her a free joint when he saw her, I don’t think she even knew his name. Stuff I found funny/sweet, my gfs family looked traumatised. So yea.... not a normal upbringing. 

I didn’t mean to bash my sister with the adhd comments, but I don’t know if you actually know what it’s like living with someone who shuts down when she’s overly stimulated or gets fits of energy and bugs out until she goes out for a walk, no matter time of day or weather. It doesn’t sound that bad, but it happens during dinner, movie time, homework help, in the middle of night.... plus there’s the whole start one thing and 3 hours later she’s actually started 5 others things, nothings finished and probably won’t be for like a week unless it’s urgent. It’s not abusive, it’s hist a lot to deal with you know?

I know it isn’t in her nature to be maternal and she admitted she’s not sure shes ever felt LOVE because she can’t relate to any media about it. (I know she does live us in her own way, but it’s hurts hearing her say that.) It’s complicated between us, but she is my sister/mother figure, even if the money stopped I wouldn’t want to lose contact. That was never an option in my mind. 

I understand where the comments related to money came from. For the record, I’m not keeping contact with my sister for the money. I don’t sound credible because I literally said it’s smarter to let her keep the account because she could put more into it, but hey, I’m an AH on behalf of my sons, not stupid.  With the money I was simply pointing out that I *understand* my gfs POV and some cash could help us (short term, not long term, I really do want my sons to have the full amount). No one in her family can help with it, my sister probably couldn’t/wouldn’t of her husband wasnt so chill. 

I asked my sister for money when we moved out of my in laws, and the second pregnancy was more complicated. She sent us money but after she got married she cut down her work hours yet the money I received tripled. I have thanked her and her husband and made them ty cards from my kids. I know this post made me sound really bad and money hungry, but please know this is just what’s going on recently, not reflective of the time before, I don’t take her money for granted and my sister knows this. But I’ll never be able to pay her back and they know it. 

I rarely think about the boys savings unless I stress over the boys futures. I certainly don’t consider it theirs, it’s legally my sisters until she gifts it. I hate that this is even a fight between gf and I because I get her POV but I can’t bring myself to ask my sister about it or ask for more money/loan I feel too guilty. I can’t ask her to stop the weekly help, we’re struggling without it some months. Someone asked, we get 250 a week. When she drew up the plans for my sons savings, she committed to 150/month but her husbands slipped once and said he sends in 500 (250 per child).

So like yea. some distance between my sister and gf for a bit would do some good. I’m going to have to explain to bf that my sister can’t be fill traditional aunt/grandma roles because while she’s both, she has very little free time. she’s trying to catch up her education and career (she’s transferring to a more reputable school with in person learning to finish her degree), and my brother has been really struggling with remote learning this year so she and her husband spend a lot of time helping him. My brother also has adhd so that’s got my sister very stressed, because they’ve yet to find meds that work for him. Just saying that stress may have led to the explosion. 

I don’t think my gf is toxic or manipulative, No more than my sister was at her age. Imma tell her to back off my sister and forget about the boys savings, we have a long way to go before it’s theirs, and it won’t be a life changing amount, just a boost to entre the adult world. But er, my gf holds grudges so the tension will be here for a while I think. If I ever throw her families lack of financial help in her face again I can kiss my sons goodbye, it’s a sore spot for her. 

Well. My question was “AITA for not asking my sister to transfer us our sons money”. Imma take it the verdict is “no, stand my ground, my sister is a modern day saint, I need to get my shit together”. Stuff I knew and unbiased brutal honesty is a real shake up I won’t lie. 

Maybe I’ll update if shit gets interesting. I’m really realllly hoping to get this behind us drama free though. Maybe I’ll answer more questions, but I got hat I came for

Edit 4: the bloody knife award? Realy? Ok 
How am. Still getting shit awards for this? Surely there’s more interesting posts?

236,YTA,AITA for helping my Son buy a house?,"Before you all jump on the bandwagon and kill me, let me explain. 

I have a Son and a Daughter. I made a pact that I would help both of them with down payment for their house after marriage. 

My Daughter married a high earner, whereas my Son married a single mom with 2 kids. 

Both my Daughter and SIL work, so I figured they can manage easily to pay for their house. My Son on the other hand is the sole earner, and earns pretty mediocre, and helping him alone with the down payment seemed correct, so I did just that. 

Upon hearing what I did, my Daughter threw a hissy fit and demanded that I help her as well. I sat her down and explained her Brothers situation, and how he is struggling as a sole earner of the house. My Daughter doesn't have any kids, but my Son has two, so more reasoning went into this. 

My SIL called me up and said what I did was correct given the current circumstances, but my Daughter won't leave this alone.

237,YTA,AITA for asking my ex to stop putting his wife before our son?,"A little context I (30) had a son(4) with Matt (28) from a fling, for reasons I didn't tell him about the kid being his, back then he wasn't interested in kids or marriage. I told him a few months ago and he is trying to build a relationship with our son.

Last year he fell in love with Sabrina who he had known for while and got married. I kind of knew Sabrina from far and she looks like someone who thinks highly of herself, i never understood why Matt was crazy about her. The problem is she is probably infertile or at least has trouble conceiving that's why she is insecure and jealous of me. She tries to act civil but it's very clear she feels uncomfortable around me. I remember one incident when our son called us a family and she got visibly upset but tried to play it cool. Another time Matt's mother uploaded a picture of us 3, her and Matt's father her with the caption ""family"" and Sabrina got so upset that she made Matt confront his mom. She constantly calls Matt when he's spending time with us so you see she's a toxic woman. 
Recently she didn't come with us to Matt's mother's place and then called crying because she was scared about something which obviously was an act. So yeah she is kind of a toxic woman.A grown woman being so scared that she calls her husband crying?? Yeah right. And Matt went running to her. So I finally put my foot down and told Matt he needs to stop choosing her over us over and over again and I understand why she might be jealous of me but she can't keep getting away with this type of childish behavior he got mad and told he us doesn't want to hear a single word against her. That she's going through a hard time but still wants him to spend time with our son and never tries to stop him, had the audacity to say that I'm the one acting jealous here and his wife hasn't done anything wrong. I was honestly shocked. His mom is on my side and told me Sabrina is jealous because she wasn't able to give Matt a kid and her a grandchild but my own mother and best friend said I'm an asshole who lacks empathy.

238,YTA,AITA for telling my fiancé that it would be tacky for her to wear a wedding dress emphasizing her baby bump?,"\*\*\*Context:\*\*\* We were originally supposed to be married back in June, but that was canceled for obvious reasons. We're both in our 30s, so the plan had been to start trying for a baby right before our wedding. I wanted to delay that when the wedding was canceled since I didn't want her to be pregnant and unmarried, but she begged me to stick with the original plan due to our age and medical history and promised that if and when she got pregnant we'd have a civil ceremony. 

She got pregnant our first cycle but didn't want to have the ceremony right away. She said there was no rush. By August she had decided she instead wanted to do a small ceremony in December at her parents' house and didn't want a civil ceremony because she wanted our ceremony to be ""real."" Fine. 

\*\*\*Dispute:\*\*\* My fiancé's original dress won't work for our wedding in December because by then she'll be almost 30 weeks pregnant, so she had to find another that would work with her stomach. I haven't seen it, but when I asked her how it works, she told me it is form fitted.  I did ask her to clarify just to be sure I didn't have the wrong idea, and she told me that the dress isn't meant to hide her stomach. It is meant to compliment it.  

I am already uncomfortable with this situation, and I have family coming that are not happy with the way we've done things. I can deal with that, but I think this is too much. It's a bad look IMO that makes us look tacky. She, on the other hand, says it's fine and not a problem. 

\*\*\*Why I may be the asshole:\*\*\* I told her my thoughts and how I felt her flaunting her pregnancy while we're getting married would be a bad look. I said that wearing a dress like that would be tacky and begged her to choose something less form fitting. 

That really upset her, so now I am the asshole because I, in her words, am prioritizing the feelings of my family over her feelings and shaming her for being pregnant and treating her like an embarrassment. 

My intent wasn't to hurt her or make her feel like I am ashamed of her, but I want her to be reasonable and sensitive to the situation. I did offer to do a separate ceremony later after the baby is born, if we had eloped, but she declined; so I don't think she can say I didn't try to accommodate her and I don't feel like my ask is unreasonable given how flexible I've been until now.

239,YTA,AITA for telling my husband that my family members are better role models for our kids than his?,"My husband & I are 32 and have been together since college. We got married shortly after we graduated, settled down, and started a family. We have 3 kids (4M, 2F, and infant F). 3 kids under 5 is...hectic. Love my babies to pieces but I really wish we had spaced them out. 

I took a year off work when my youngest daughter was born. Quality childcare costs for 3 kids (especially a newborn) would've been nearly my entire paycheck. My oldest will start school next year so likely I'll go back to work then. 

I've been enjoying my time with the kids and been taking them to visit my family. My parents live half an hour away. I also have 2 sisters who live nearby with their families. We're constantly meeting up at my parent's house and spending time with the kids there.

My husband recently brought up that the kids should also see their paternal side, which I agree with. So I took them and we spent an afternoon. But then obviously we went back to our normal schedule (spending most days at my parent's house with my sisters & their kids). 

My husband said it was unfair that one side of the family is getting WAY more time with the grandkids. I said to him that, honestly, environment influences children and I think my family provides a better environment. They are all college graduates, working good jobs, do stuff like actually read books with their kids and it's not just constant chaos. 

Don't get me wrong, his family is a lot of fun but they're not role models. They don't have higher aspirations, only 1 college grad and that's my husband, and the kids are either watching TV or running around outside on the trampoline or the backyard. 

I definitely want my kids to see their dad's side often and I've made that happen because they're family and they're wonderful people.

She had a consultation with a surgeon, and to remove the skin it is going to be thousands of dollars that she’s going to have to pay out of pocket.

I told her it’s not a good idea financially and that’s my final say, and if she decides to go through with the surgery then I’m going to be upset.

It was very hard on our family, honestly the grief is something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy and I never imagined losing my own child. 

I have been friends with Liz since 8th grade. We have always been very close and have always adored each other. 

We met up recently, both wearing our masks and social distancing. She started to complain about how she has gained weight during the quarantine, her kids gained some weight, are falling behind in school and don't leave her alone during the day, etc. I felt super uncomfortable, I didn't want to say anything at first but I was pissed.

It kind of just escalated, I put my mini backpack on and started to head out and she said ""Is every okay?"" and I said ""I don't know, I don't feel like hearing about how much you hate your kids while I had to bury my own"" to which she replied ""I'm just venting to you"" so I told her ""Liz shut the fuck up"" and left and cried in my car for a bit.

Listen, I know how stressful being a mother is. I am a mother of 4 (even though I lost one of them I will always have 4 children) 

It broke my heart to say something like that to a friend but it's been really upsetting seeing other friends posting stuff about how their kids have been bothering them during quarantine, even some making adoption jokes. Liz has so many other friends to vent to about her kids. But at the end of the day these parents will have zero idea what it's really like to lose a child and it's nothing fun at all, I would give anything to have my daughter back no matter how much stress she brought upon me.

Liz texted me back, saying she is sorry for making me feel bad but refused to apologize for venting about her children. I blocked her number. I asked another girl, Mia, who was part of our friend group in 8th grade if I was an AH and she said even if I am going through my own grieving period, I should allow my friend to rant to me (which is honestly ridiculous, I haven't responded to her and might block her)

It was sort of a father-son thing and my wife often didn't come along. We did plenty of other activities together as a family, but that was our special little thing.

With her passing and all, we didn't go the last two years but during that time I met a woman with a step daughter. For reference, my son is 10 and the daughter is 8. At first the new relationship was especially hard on my son, I always assured him that his mother will never be replaced, but to just think of it as an extended family.

I wanted to include my son as much as possible and I had the great idea of continuing our annual trips to the amusement park together to bring back some normalcy. Fortunately, it opened back up in limited capacity and I was able to get tickets.

When my step daughter heard we were going to the park, she begged to come along but I told her it was a father-son thing and we could always do something else together as a family later on. She cried and went through all the usual temper tantrums like ""it's not fair."" My wife yelled at me and told me to include her (she has to work so she can't come along). 

I think my wife is being totally unreasonable. This is just a way to bond with my son and it's something he expressed he wants to do together without his step-sister. Now obviously my son is my blood and I will definitely prioritize him over my step daughter, but I don't see the big deal in doing this with my son and spending time with my step daughter later on?",2020-11-02 15:29:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jmpi57/aita_for_not_taking_my_step_daughter_with_me_and/,519,1586,0.93,1
244,YTA,AITA for defending my father after he made some comments about my wife breastfeeding but then apologized?,"So to be clear, I am NOT defending what he said. It was rude and I told that to him myself. What I am defending him on is the fact that he said it, apologized, my wife accepted, and then she followed up by sending a harsh message to him after the fact. My point to her, and where we disagree, is that after he apologized and she accepted that should have been the end of it. She says that what he said didn't fully register until after he'd apologized and she had more time to think about it, and she felt rushed into accepting his apology by both of us. That is why she did it without thinking.  

Now to the actual event. On Friday night my parents dropped by our house on short notice (literally as they were pulling up). We weren't really prepared for them but we let them in anyway. My wife was sitting in a chair in our living room breastfeeding our son when my dad walked in. He did not see anything other than my wife's boob (not nipple), but based on that he decided he had to comment so he told her that he could see why his grandson was so well fed. Then when my mom walked in he told her something like ""we don't have to worry about John starving by the looks of it."" My wife is very insecure about her body post-baby, so she was very upset and in tears.  

I told my dad that he owed my wife an apology and if he said more things like that to her he wouldn't be welcome in our home. My mom also called him out for this.  He quickly apologized and asked for her forgiveness. He also promised not to make comments like that again. 

My wife was still upset and not saying anything, and I did say to her that I thought my dad meant his apology and I hoped she could forgive him. I think this is what she means by saying she felt rushed. She said she accepted and he apologized again. Then my parents left. I thought that was the end of it because it seemed like we'd worked this out. 

I found out today that my wife sent my dad a message the next day raking him over the coals for what he said and telling him he was a pervert, disgusting and she didn't want him in her home again for a long time. My dad was definitely an asshole and probably deserved what she said, but I think it's an asshole move also to accept an apology and then bring the issue back up again, which is what I told her. I think she is entitled to say what she did but not after the fact and the issue was considered resolved. That is why I think she also crossed a line, although I think what she did was nothing close to being as bad as what he did. She was upset I defended him at all and said I was the asshole for not fully supporting her.

245,YTA,AITA for telling my daughter (12) she has no say in whether we move or not?,"My (31F) boyfriend (50) owns a small management consulting firm.

A lot of times his job involves having a project in City X for three to six months. This hasn’t been a problem for our relationship until now, because we started dating in April and nobody was traveling for the past few months.

However, he has recently landed a large project that would require him to be in Philadelphia for close to 5 months. 

We live in Chicago so that’s more than 700 miles away. 

My boyfriend said that if I went with him I could take a job as a personal assistant for him and his team and we wouldn’t have to deal with anything long distance. He could focus on his work and we would have a common goal to work towards every day.

This was a time sensitive decision and after considering and having a few more heart to hearts with him, I told him to make arrangements for us to be in Philly together. 

I sat my daughter down and told her about the move. I said the school she was going to was a great school and she could always make more friends. 

She was extremely angry and said that she doesn’t want to go and to tell my boyfriend that I changed my mind. 

I then got pretty angry because she started saying rude things about my boyfriend and how I wouldn’t be able to force her to talk to him. In finally excused myself from the situation but reminded her that she had no say in any of our moving decisions. AITA?

246,YTA,"Aita for telling my wife of she wants to get a job, she has to cover the financial deficit?","I 26m work and make good money. My wife, 26f wants to get a job so she has something to do. We have a small child who works need child care of she went to work, so I did all the math. I alone make too much to apply for subsidized childcare, and if she went out to get a job, the amount of would cost us for childcare would be more than she would make at the jobs she wants, so I told her if she wants the job she would have to figure out how to cover the deficit.

INFO

The deficit isn't as simple as ""oh we lose a little money ;-;"" it would be a significant amount, enough to make us over all struggle. I suppose saying ""I make good money"" was to broad a statement. I make enough to pay for our home, bills, groceries, insurances, vehicle, etc, while having enough money left over to do a few nice things, go to a movie, order food or go out to dinner, but I hardly make anything extravagant. 

Secondarily, a lot of people seem to think I have a problem with her getting a job at all, which is not the case? It's the math. When we first moved in with her, I told her she wouldn't need to work if she did not want too. If she wanted to, that was fine. We split the household accordingly. We had a kid, and she was still fine starting home. 

I have given her alternative options to make money and work that would allow us to not lose enough money every month that we would be scraping by each month but she refuses. I've asked her if she wants to go back to school to get a degree that would open her to to higher paying jobs, she just wants to go work at a, and I quote, Wendy's or a Walmart or something,"" so she refuses post secondary. 

To those of you saying ""your stay home and let her work,"" no? I am our financial foundation and the jobs she wants wouldn't give her the pay or the hours to support us. That's dumb. Cause if her job didn't work out we wouldn't be able to afford anything. Including our base bills

INFO 2
I've been messaged a few times by people suggesting I create a fund with the money I ""save"" on child care with her being the Sahm so if she wants a divorce she can leave without being worried about finances.

as part of a our marital agreement, since I am the primary income earner, I have a fund set aside so if she were to want a divorce she would be covered for 3 months rent, her basic needs met for a year, as well as child support. We even have a custody agreement, since I personally believe they are more important than a birth certificate stating we have 50/50 custody. Yes, you can get a custody agreement over a child even if you aren't splitting up. I suggest everyone gets one, because I don't want to deal with the stress of a custody battle, and I don't want our child to have to deal with the fallout of a custody battle. Same with divorce. It's entirely unnecessary.

When we got married, and when we had a kid, divorce and custody battle were possibilities that I wanted nothing more than too avoid. If they did happen however, I wanted it to be as easy as possible for everyone involved. I would rather have these things and not need them, then to not have them and need them.",2020-11-25 17:32:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k0wktt/aita_for_telling_my_wife_of_she_wants_to_get_a/,256,255,0.89,0
247,YTA,AITA for arguing with my wife over what she says in her sleep?,"My wife has always talked in her sleep since I have have known her. More than anyone else I've ever known. We slept in different rooms for a while because of it, but sleep together now and I can sleep through most of it. I know it isn't intentional from her side but it does annoy me anyway sometimes.

The last few weeks since we are sleeping in the same bed again, she usually falls asleep first and sleeps later. So I'm just laying on my phone and hear a lot of weird sleep comments. Some are making me uncomfortable. 

Examples:

""I don't want to have sex, you're gross"" (while touching me)

""Josh, you're so cute"" (my name is not Josh)

""Are you watching the baby"" (we don't have kids and don't want them)

""This cake tastes like puke"" (I have been baking for her recently)

When I try to ask her about it in the morning she says she doesn't remember, and that's probably true. But I ask her what her dreams were and she says she can't remember that too. Dreams are based on real feelings and thoughts in the day so these kinds of comments make me super uncomfortable because it isn't what she says to my face but it comes out when her guard is down. She says her real thoughts are the ones she tells me when she is awake but I'm starting to feel paranoid

I am insisting we have a real talk about what she really feels and she keeps saying it is impossible because she has no idea why she said those things. I just think deep down, she does, and doesn't want to say. 

Am I being an asshole to keep pushing this convo? I just feel it's important for our relationship but she disagrees with that. If she has thoughts she isn't sharing it could ruin us later and I don't want to be hurt.",2020-10-28 23:21:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jjyth1/aita_for_arguing_with_my_wife_over_what_she_says/,850,1059,0.9,2
248,YTA,AITA for comforting my wife during a therapy session with her daughter ?,"I met my wife 3 years ago. We got married last year and she has a 17 year old daughter named Amanda who I'm pretty close with. 

The story goes that when Amanda was 5, my wife cheated on Amanda's father and married the man, who was in love with my wife but treated Amanda like shit. It went on until she was 12, when the guy finally left my wife. Amanda has told me that this guy would emotionally abuse her and apparently gave her an eating disorder and insecurity issues. She would try to tell her mom all about this and she never did anything about it.

Recently, my wife got Amanda therapy after having some breakdowns. We got on the Zoom meeting, all three of us sat in front of the camera. Amanda told the therapist everything about the stuff she went through as a young child and how her mom put this guy before her. 

My wife was sobbing hearing all of this. It was well deserved but I instinctively started rubbing her shoulder and gave her a kiss. Amanda saw this on camera and freaked out and started screaming at me and said her mom deserved to feel like shit. And that her mom was only experiencing a small fraction of what she had to go through for 7 years.

Amanda came to me hours later to apologize for flipping out but said she still thinks I'm an AH for comforting her mom who has caused her so much pain.

AITA??

249,YTA,AITA for being grossed out by my girlfriend rarely washing her hair and not brushing it?,"Since quarantine started my gf has gotten very into a new hair routine. I guess one of her friends was trying it and she wanted to see if it would work for her hair (it's wavy/curly). Since starting it, her hair is definitely way more curly and it does look nice.

However as we were talking about it she mentioned that she only washes her hair every 3-4 days and I  tried not to say anything but I definitely had a shocked look on my face so when she asked what was wrong I said I thought that was unhygenic. She said it's healtier for it and said it's not a big deal because ""it's not like her hair smells or anything"" which of course it's not going to smell bad when you're loading it up with a bunch of hair products every day.

On top of this I realized yesterday she doesn't even brush her hair anymore. She was cooking and I came up and rubbed her back a bit and my fingers ran through her hair a bit, she said ""ow"" and pulled back a bit and asked if I'd please be careful since it hurts when her hair is tugged on like that. I said sure, fine, don't want to cause her pain but I was also like ""What do you do when you need to brush it then?"" and she said she never brushes it, only uses a comb in the shower when her hair is wet. Meaning she only ever combs through it every 3-4 days. I was like ""what, are you trying to grow dreads??"" to which she just said ""That wouldn't even happen, I'm white"" which wasn't even my point but whatever. She was like ""what is wrong?"" and I said I just found it gross that she doesn't take basic care of her hair. She just laughed and said I didn't know what I was talking about so to not be a dick about it.

AITA? I don't think it's that ridiculous to be put off by someone not practicing regular hygeine but she is very proud of her hair lately.

EDIT: Thank you for your comments everyone, I accept I'm the AH here. I looked up the Curly Girl method some of you posted about and apologized to my girlfriend. She said that tomorrow after she washes her hair, I can watch her put the products in and see specifically how she mantains the hair, so I'm going to do that! All is well here again. :)

EDIT 2: Wow, this blew up. Again, I fully accept I was being an asshole and I completely understand why. To give some more context (with the permission of my gf), my gf also lives with bipolar type 2 and in the past, changes in hygiene have always been an indicator of a mood swing. Obviously that wasn't the case this time around but after talking it through i realized that this past experience is part of what informed my own concern. Obviously that doesn't excuse my judginess, but I was just glad that after talking it through I was able to figure out for myself what was actually poking at me--not the hair, but rather me worrying that something else was going on. I'm really glad I know about the CGM now, and I'm actually really excited for my gf to show me her routine tomorrow! Also, my gf is having a fun time reading through the comments and we're both laughing about how much of an ass i was about this. She also now wants to make a reddit account to join the curly girl subreddit, so thank you to everyone who suggested that!

250,YTA,AITA For saying “Oh well..” when I heard that my MIL passed away?,"
I M33 been married to my wife for over three years. And I absolutely hated my (now) deceased mother in law for a number of reasons.

She hated me for no good reason and treated me horribly over the years. She insulted my family/my degree/my home constantly. She called me all kinds of bad names and was able to get the whole family convinced that I was some kind of a narcissistic,greedy asshole who only married her daughter for her money. I've endured years of being disrespected/belittled and being kicked out and told to never come back. All while she was dealing with cancer which my wife used as excuse to defend her and she never ever backed me up not even once. I was told to suck it up and keep my mouth shut.

Mother in law lost her battle with cancer last week. My wife spent the majority of her time with her since her golden child didn't bother to visit and take care of his mother.

My wife was with her when she passed away. My wife then came home and told me that her mom just died while I was in the kitchen. I looked at my wife and said “oh. Well...” my wife stared at me shocked. I could see she was crying because her face was red. She yelled at me asking me how i could be this cold towards a tragedy and that she just lost her mom. She kept yelling at me and started crying and calling me names.

She left after that and stayed there with her family and refused to come home after the funeral.

My mom was there and she heard about my response. She berated me saying that I should've supported my wife instead of being petty and bitter and that she won't blame my wife if she decides to never come home after what i did.",2020-11-27 01:08:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k1rfzo/aita_for_saying_oh_well_when_i_heard_that_my_mil/,161,352,0.91,1

252,YTA,WIBTA if i told hubby i want kids within 2 years or goodbye?,"My hubby (41m) and I (33f) have been married for only 2 years, but we have had some conflicting views that have emerged since then. I want children, he's unsure. Not the case when we got married: both wanted around 3 children (I'm willing to bring it down to 1 now). We argue about this a lot, but have a pretty good marriage overall. Recently, something major happened with my family (health scare) and I realized that my husband is not capable of providing the physical or emotional support that it may take to raise a child. He's lazy and has a tendency to get touchy, but I'm okay with that up until a point. Not only do I not want to change him if he doesn't want to, but I also don't want him to regret making a major decision just to make me happy, or walk out on our child. I'm pretty stable and will be sad if we ended, but I'm okay to do what it takes to build the family I want.

He does has some abandonment issues as a result of his parents basically walking out on him as a child and we did move really fast in our relationship (house, car, marriage, etc.). So, he's a little overwhelmed and confused about whether he wants more responsibilities. We are working on things with a therapist, but she anticipates it will take years before he feels secure enough to have children given his reluctance to admit such problems. WIBTA if I told him I want to have a baby within 2 years but if he doesn't want to, we should go our separate ways?

Tl;dr: Want a baby, husband unsure. Should I give him an ultimatum?

&#x200B;

Update: Thank you, I've decided against the ultimatum.

I think I didn't explain it well enough in my original post, but he has not ever said that he does NOT want kids, just not sure anymore. We did and do communicate about this, just often times it ends in frustration. We diligently go to couples therapy each week because of this change of mind (and other things) and our therapist has struggled to get a straight answer out of him. Its not that he's this horrible human being that is incapable of being a father...it's just that he shows selfish tendencies like how I probably did at 20, except that he's 41 y/o...

It's not that I saw and realized he was this emotionally broken man and decided to take advantage of it. We both have our traumas and he carries himself well and felt that he addressed everything earlier in his life - which is why he said he was ready to marry and have children with me. We did discuss it thoroughly, including which parental techniques we would use. So, yes, it's been difficult and shocking, but I love him very much. I have mentioned that I would let him take some time to figure it out, but I don't know when that time should be up. We've also agreed that if he decides no, that we will divorce, but I'm afraid it's enabled him to hang in ""maybe"" for too long.

Anyways, I haven't decided what to do. I do love and care for him and worry most of all because I am the main breadwinner, but I will not simply walk out on him. I think we may need to part ways, which is why I want to be sure that I am not having isolated and bias thoughts. That's it - I still find reading all your comments very helpful.",2020-11-22 22:07:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jz4nzl/wibta_if_i_told_hubby_i_want_kids_within_2_years/,189,502,0.92,0
253,YTA,AITA For getting my daughter a cake she doesn’t like for her birthday?,"Yesterday was my daughters birthday and unfortunately it did not go as well as I expected despite all my efforts in arranging her birthday. I spent countless of hours preparing her birthday (Contacting her friends, blowing balloons, decorating house) only to be heavily criticised by my husband and relatives in the end. Let me explain what happened.

&#x200B;

I was responsible for purchasing the cake for my now 10 year old daughter. My daughter isn’t a big fan of chocolate cake especially if it contains walnuts and instead  wanted a simple strawberry cake with vanilla frosting. Guys, who eats such a cake? I am aware we don’t have to have the same preferences, but I can guarantee you that NO ONE I KNOW is a fan of strawberry cake EXCEPT her. I couldn’t let all the guests disappointed with the cake only because she wants strawberry cake, I had to think about the majority (and I’ll admit, I am crazy over chocolate) so instead I went with walnuts chocolate cake and politely asked the baker if she could add some strawberries on the top for my daughter.

&#x200B;

I didn’t really have the time to tell her that I didn’t get her the cake she wanted so she was really excited to eat the cake and asked us to start singing happy birthday 2 hours before the time we were supposed to. When she saw the cake she was really disappointed. She started screaming and crying. I whispered and begged her to stop because the guests were looking but she wasn’t stopping and I got so embarrassed. She ended up not eating the cake anymore and the guests left earlier than usual because my daughter was really upset over the cake and couldn’t get over it.

&#x200B;

I had a huge argument with my husband over this. Guys, don’t get me wrong, while I was aware she wasn’t a big fan of the cake, I had NO IDEA it was going to turn out like this. If I had known this I would have just bought her the strawberry cake. AITA here?

254,YTA,AITA for taking attention away from the bride at a wedding?,"I suffer from Panic Disorder, which means I tend to suffer panic attacks on a regular basis. They're usually triggered by external stimuli, especially if it's related to my C-PTSD, but they can also happen seemingly out of nowhere. I was abused repeatedly as a child, and am still dealing with the fallout in adulthood.

Fast forward to last weekend. My GF's cousin (let's call her Susan) was getting married, and invited me to come to the wedding as a +1. It was a very small, intimate ceremony, but relatively safe given COVID restrictions. I'd already been feeling on edge earlier that morning after an argument with my dad, but decided to come anyway thinking being with my GF's family would help get my mind off things. Sadly, this ""on edge"" feeling didn't go away. I tried to ""hold in"" my anxiety to keep the peace, but it wasn't working. My GF tried calming me down, holding my hand and assuring me everything was ok. After a few minutes, I got up during the vows, and headed for the lobby to try and calm down. My GF got up with me. A few people stared at us as we left. After a while, I did feel better, and some relatives asked me if I was all right. It felt nice knowing these total strangers weren't going to judge me for a mental health crisis that I couldn't control.

Later that day, I was at my GF's apartment. While she was in the bathroom, her phone went off, revealing a string of texts from Susan. I didn't snoop through her phone; texts on iPhones appear briefly for a few seconds while on sleep mode. Due to post length rules, I'll give a brief summary. Susan thanked my GF for coming to her wedding, but added that it was very rude to just get up and leave in the middle of the ceremony. Susan said she worked her butt off to make the wedding happen in spite of COVID, my GF and I took attention away from her, and that I should've stayed home. I later told my GF about the texts, and she apologized profusely for Susan's behavior. She said she never remembered her cousin acting like this, and maybe she was just caught up in the heat of the wedding. I'm sure that's true, but Susan's not the first person bothered by my panic attacks, and she won't be the last.

Maybe I should've stayed home. I was already feeling panicky to begin with, but I left anyway because I love being around my GF and her family. Maybe it was selfish of me to do this on such a special occasion as a wedding. AITA?

Edit: I don't think I made a big scene or anything. I had some staggered breathing, tremors, and felt lightheaded. There were about 12-15 people in the audience.

Edit 2: I now see that ITA here,  but thanks for also being understanding of my disorder. I hope Susan will accept my apology. I never meant to ruin the wedding, but I shouldn't have used it as a way to make myself feel better. I should've stayed home, and found someone else to talk through my panic attack. I just thought my GF would've been the best person ATM.",2020-11-09 23:18:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jr8y9g/aita_for_taking_attention_away_from_the_bride_at/,273,1315,0.94,3

Everyone thought it was a great idea...except June.

June said she was happy I was happy, but she wouldn't be attending that type of event. I asked her why, I made sure to plan it on a day everyone could come. She said it wasn't something she was comfortable with. I got upset and told her its not about her comfort, its about attending to support me.

She told me she would be very upset if her husband attended a party with strippers and so she woule never even ask to do the same. It would be ""hypocritical"" of her to hold him to those standards but expect to be able to do what she wanted just bc it was my Bachelorette. June told me she'd be happy to attend once they left but there was no way she'd disrespect her husband like that. She also said that even if he wasn't in the picture, shes not comfortable with it.

I got very upset and told her she was a bad friend for completely refusing to even ask her husband or to put aside her goody-two-shoes attitude for one night thats for ME, NOT her or her husband.

She was very exited because she only gets to see her cousin (21 at the time) every 2 or 3 years.

When I came home that afternoon my niece and daughter were upstairs getting ready. Now as a rule I don't allow my daughter to put on too much make up. Mascara and lipbalm is fine but not more. I just want her to have a normal childhood and not grow up too fast.

When she came down I was kind of shocked. She had on eyeshadow, eyeliner and mascara. It was very noticeable. At the time I didn't say much but I made a passive aggressive comment I have to admit.

When they left I called my nices mother and told her. My sister was just like ""relax"". But I don't agree. I don't want my daughter walking around like a slut.

When they came back I pulled my niece aside and basically reprimanded her and told her she would be barred from my place if she didn't respect my rules and forced things on my daughter that were not age apropriate. My niece basically said that she only did what my daughter asked her for and that she is 16. As long as she doesn't walk around naked, make up is her personal choice. I called her an Uber and told her she would be welcomed back as soon as she apologized to us.

My sister had been cold since then and my daughter has also been very pissed because I didn't let her cousin come over for the rest of her trip.

257,YTA,AITA for hating my husband's PhD thesis?,"Disclaimer: he hasn't written it yet, but he has been accepted as a PhD student (full-time, paid job here) which also means that his area of study and thesis subject has been approved already. I won't be too specific, but it has to do with the effect of IT/technology and gamification on education and...    
    
It's just so stupid!    
    
We've talked about this for years, and I've always made it clear that I found gamification and (to an extent) the overuse of technology in educational settings to be detrimental to the entire ordeal. Not only have I struggled to find any (in my opinion) credible academic literature to support the subject, but having been a teacher for just shy of a decade, I've never seen a practical approach with those two elements that didn't crash and burn or, at the very least, only produced results similar to lesson plans without them present.    
    
Well, now that he's been accepted, he's really excited. In his own words, he was ""stuck"" in IT jobs (development, not support) for years, and he missed the human element of interviewing people and for his work to have a real impact on society besides adding to the bottomline of corporations.    
    
I can respect that, but since it's all he wants to talk about, and two night ago, we had some wine with dinner, and a few more after, and when he started talking about it again, I just couldn't. I snapped and told him to STFU with his pseudoscience.    
    
Well, the mood was ruined, and so was the weekend. He's barely spoken to me today, but his best friend reached out and asked if I actually said that. I was honest, and explained why, and all he could say was ""Wow""    
    
Just to be clear, I don't think I'm the asshole for expressing my view on his forthcoming research, but am I the asshole for the way I expressed it?    
    
tl;dr: My husband will only talk about his upcoming PhD studies, and I snapped he needed to STFU.",2020-11-16 17:44:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jvb7gj/aita_for_hating_my_husbands_phd_thesis/,292,548,0.87,3
258,YTA,AITA for not bringing my fat friend hiking?,"My friends “Sophie”, “Lucy”, “Austin”, and I are college students. While none of us are star athletes, Sophie, Lucy, and I are more fit while Austin is on the heavier side. He also has mild asthma. 

A few weeks ago, the four of us went hiking. The trail was steep but Sophie, Lucy, and I were able to make it up without too many issues. However, we had to stop several times so Austin could catch his breath. At one point he told us to keep going without him and he’d meet us when we came back down the mountain. We kept encouraging him and he did make it to the top after some struggles. 

Sophie recently got asked on a hiking date and wanted to make sure she was prepared so she texted Lucy and I asking if we’d like to go hiking with her. She made it clear that she didn’t want to invite Austin as she wanted to be able to take a challenging trail without him slowing us down. Lucy and I agreed to hike with her. 

We had a lovely hike with nice views. I snapped a picture at one point and without thinking I posted it on my snapchat story. When I got home I noticed I had a message from Austin asking where I’d been. I told him I’d gone for a hike with Sophie and Lucy. He responded “Where was my invite?” I said that Sophie had texted Lucy and I and it had been a fairly last minute thing. He didn’t respond after that and I assumed he was done with the situation. 

The next day the four of us were hanging out together when Austin made a passive aggressive comment about how he “hoped we enjoyed yesterday’s hike without him.” Here’s where I think I may be TA: I stepped in immediately and told him the reason we didn’t invite him is because on the last hike he slowed us down a lot and we wanted to be able to be able to challenge ourselves. He seemed pretty upset and left. Lucy agrees with me while Sophie says I could’ve found a nicer way to phrase it. Did I go to far?

Edit: in a short amount of time this has already gathered a fair bit of attention. I accept that I am TA and I am going to apologize to Austin

Edit #2: I’m seeing a lot of comments of “Austin would’ve known it was too much for him and said no” but he is the type who wants to be part of everything and wouldn’t sit it out. We didn’t want to abandon him somewhere on the mountain. I am absolutely open to hiking with him in the future and beginning with some less challenging trails to help him build his stamina. 
That being said, I do accept that I am TA, especially for posting the picture and how I spoke to him.",2020-11-04 21:14:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jo55ki/aita_for_not_bringing_my_fat_friend_hiking/,383,1431,0.93,0
259,YTA,AITA for refusing to move out because my family is angry with me for a big mistake I made?,"I'm 23F and lately moved back in with my parents. They have a tiny basement suite with a bedroom/bathroom that is kind of separate where I stay. We share common areas but I pay 200/month rent and help with chores, and we mostly stay out of each other's hair. 

My sister (25F) and her husband (27M) needed a place to stay in between moves so they've been in my parents guest room for 4 months. They were planning to move into their new place Dec 1

I do freelance work online, but my sister and parents physically go to work every day. My sister's husband recently lost his job so he is home too. We got to know each other a lot better with some one on one conversation and really got along. I honestly never spent much time with him before and it was super fun to hang out a bit and not feel so isolated all the time (not much, just having lunch in the kitchen together and occasionally watching a TV show on a break)

2 weeks ago I had a day off but everyone else was at work. My sister's husband said he had weed brownies and asked if I wanted to spend an afternoon being high and watching movies and I was curious as someone who doesn't try weed much so I agreed. We also had a few drinks. 

I feel like I got confused, but one thing led to another and we ended up having sex. It happened so fast and I didn't realize how awful it was until afterwards and told him that could never happen again and we have to stop hanging out. He agreed easily.

I guess he felt guilty because he ended up telling my sister, and she told our parents. Everyone is freaking out. My mom told me yesterday she wants me to move out, even though my sister decided she doesn't want to move with her husband anymore. I tried explaining so much but nobody will let me get my thoughts out - they just want me to leave.

I pay rent, so they can't kick me out over a personal issue. I accept that I did something wrong but I need time to set something up at least. And think they should at least listen to my apology even if not accept it.

I fucked up, and I will leave. I think my sister is going to take over the suite. Her husband already left somewhere. I don't have enough savings to just go immediately so I said I'm staying until things are easier for moving.

Nobody is talking to me now. I know I'm an AH for sleeping with my sister's husband, but am I also an AH for refusing to leave so suddenly?

Edit: Okay, I get it. I am an asshole for sticking around the household. I see all your comments and some are telling me how you would feel in the same situation as my sister, and that is enough - I will expediate this as much as I can. I am calling around now trying to buy a week or two with a friend while I sort out my living situation.

260,YTA,AITA for referring to my wife's twin pregnancy as our two-for-one special?,"It's just a funny way I've used to tell people that we're having twins. I think it's funny and so does everyone I've told so far, but my wife disagrees and has asked me to stop. So far I haven't because I don't understand why she finds it so offensive when there's nothing I see that's offensive about it, but she seems to think that it's demeaning but can't explain exactly why she feels that way. 

Today we stopped by my friend's house. He knows we're pregnant but not that we're having twins. We were giving him some updates on the pregnancy and when he asked if we knew what we were having I told him my wife was having a two-for-one special - twins! He and his fiancé both thought it was hilarious, but my wife didn't. 

In the car on the way back home she called me an asshole and said she was sick of my joke and didn't want to hear it again. 

I can't understand what I've done that merits calling me an asshole. I know that some jokes are offensive and if they are then you should stop, but this seems like about as harmless as you can get.

261,YTA,WIBTA if I told the owner of a struggling local pizza place that his staff is turning down business during the pandemic because it would take them slightly more work than usual?,"There is a great little hole-in-the-wall pizza place in my neighborhood that I LOVE. I’ve been ordering pizza from them for years. Sadly, I know they are hanging on by a thread because of the pandemic, so I try to support them by giving in to my pizza cravings more often, tipping the driver more, ordering more add-ons, etc. Nothing extraordinary, just rooting for them to survive this thing. They appear on Grubhub, but they do all of their own deliveries.

A friend of mine left town for Thanksgiving (yeah, irresponsible, but not relevant for this post), so yesterday I was at her house to look in on her pets (cat and turtles). The cat seemed lonely, so I figured I’d order a pizza and chill with him for a while. I couldn’t order on Grubhub because my friend’s house is a couple of blocks outside the restaurant’s standard delivery area (less than half a mile). I called and told the employee that I understood I was slightly outside their delivery area but I’d be happy to pay ANY extra delivery fee they wanted and would tip the driver 30%. The employee pretty much said, “No, sorry, you’re outside our delivery area, bye” and hung up.

I’m pretty positive they weren’t busy (Tuesday afternoon during a pandemic), I literally told the employee that I’d pay extra AND tip 30%, and this is a casual family-owned pizza joint, not some corporate franchise with rigid, unbendable policies. I understand why the employee said no, but I also kinda feel like the owner should know what happened, so he can decide if he wants to train the staff to handle that kind of thing differently in the future. At least until he’s sure they’re going to survive the pandemic.

To be 100% clear, my goal isn’t to complain or be a “Karen”. It’s not even a complaint & I'll absolutely remain as loyal a customer as I've always been! I totally understand that the employee did not do ANYTHING wrong, and I'd never dream of telling the owner if the place weren't struggling so badly. I just think if I were the owner, I’d want a heads-up if my staff were turning down good business when the shop is SO close to shutting down, just to avoid driving a few extra blocks. That said, I feel like an AH to snitch on some random employee who’s probably making minimum wage, surely under enough stress, just trying to get through his shift. And maybe it would be wrong of me to encourage a business owner to push his employees to do more work than they signed up for. I’m really torn.

WIBTA if I tell the owner what happened? (Again, not as a nasty complaint, just as a well-intentioned heads-up.)",2020-11-25 20:36:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k10c39/wibta_if_i_told_the_owner_of_a_struggling_local/,149,450,0.92,0
262,YTA,AITA for not wanting to display my step daughter's pottery in my house?,"I'm a 22 year old woman. Earlier this year I got married to my then boyfriend of two years, who I'll call Oli. He's 34 and already has two kids, a boy and a daughter.

We moved in together in January. I had to move away from my hometown because Oli got a new job. I was a little unhappy about moving away, so to appease me Oli told me I could choose the house and decorate it.

I found this magnificent house and we moved in, along with his kids, who split their time between our house and their mom's. Since January I've been decorating and it looks gorgeous. 

Everything was going pretty well until earlier this week. When the kids came back from the weekend at their mom's, Oli's daughter, who is 11, was carrying a huge box. It was so big and heavy that she needed her older brother and Oli to help get it into the house. I asked her what was in it, and then she opened it and I saw that it was full of her pottery projects from the last five or so years of school.

I asked why she had brought them all, and she said that her mother told her to bring them because her mother is moving to a smaller apartment and so doesn't have room. I thought it was sort of odd but whatever. I asked her if she wanted me to help carry them into the basement or the attic. She said that no, she was going to put them in her room, so I helped bring them upstairs. She asked if she could leave her newest project downstairs to show it off. It looked alright so I let her put it somewhere out of the way that didn't clash too much with the decor.

Well, I guess she sent her mom a picture, because later that day her mom called me. She said that she wanted me to put up the rest of the pottery pieces around the house to show them off. I was sort of weirded out because we barely talk. I told her that and I explained how they didn't fit into the decor, so I would rather not. At no point did my step daughter ask to put any of the others up.

When Oli came home from work, he told me that his ex had called him to complain about not putting the pottery up. He asked me to just find places to put the rest up, because he was proud of how good they were. Honestly they were pretty terrible, so I told him no again, and I reminded him of how he promised I could decorate the house alone.

This devolved into a fight in which we both called each other some hurtful things. Now we're not talking. I guess I could put up the rest of the pottery, but it's more the principle of the thing that bothers me. I don't appreciate my husband's ex wife trying to come into my house and tell me how to decorate. Oli also promised me I would decorate and no one else, so I think it's unfair to renege on that promise. I don't want to be the evil stepmother, but I also refuse to be stepped on in my own house. I don't have any friends around here to give me a reality check, so AITA?",2020-11-13 19:41:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jtmnui/aita_for_not_wanting_to_display_my_step_daughters/,310,514,0.88,0

I (34M) don’t think I’m the asshole, but my mom said I’m lucky my wife (32F) didn’t crack me over the head with a frying pan, and my friend said I was being a dipshit.

Thanksgiving is a big deal in my family. My wife is a pediatric nurse on a cancer ward, and works every other year and it’s 12 hour shifts, so even if she does stop by, it’s somewhat late. This year it’s her year to work. My dad mentioned to me over the weekend that they found it disrespectful that she only came every other year. I reminded him she was a nurse, but he said she knew how important Thanksgiving was to our family and how she should work something out because our traditions are her traditions now. I agreed with that.

I mentioned trying to get every Thanksgiving off to my wife and she said it didn’t work that way schedule wise, and that even if she could get this year off, that would mean she’d have to give up Christmas and that’s the holiday that’s a big deal in her family. I told her that since she married me my families traditions should be more important to her. She got pretty aggravated at that, and walked away from me.

I called to tell my parents and my mom flipped out. Apparently, only my dad thinks that and my mom thinks I should go grovel for forgiveness for suggesting “such stupidity”. The thing is, I do kinda agree with my dad. My mom called my wife to apologize for our behavior and let her know she’d save her a plate if she wanted to stop by after work. I’m aggravated at my mom, and feel like she should have butt out because I don’t think this is an unreasonable request. So, AITA for wanting my wife to prioritize my family traditions?

265,YTA,AITA for telling my husband that he’s not my daughter’s father so he has no say?,"I’ve been married to my husband for 10 years.

However, he is not my 21 year old daughter’s father.

My daughter’s father died right after she was born. Because his parents were very well off, they wanted to make sure that my daughter was never going to go want for anything. 

Therefore, they set up a trust fund that would essentially give her $6,000 a month starting when she was 18 and would continue until she was 50. 

However I raised my daughter with the understanding that she should go to college and get a paying job after. 

My daughter took two gap years so this is her freshman year of college.

For her college, if you opted to be on campus, you had to pay for on campus housing as a freshman but they can’t force you to stay in it if you don’t want to.

We moved my daughter in, and she texted me a week later saying the dorm absolutely sucks. 

That the lighting is awful, the room is small, the building is old- she can see a lot of places where there are rust in the bathrooms, and her neighbors complain about her guitar playing even though she feels most creative later at night.

She said it was pretty hard to function in the dorms and asked that she be allowed to move to an off campus apartment. I took a look at the pictures she sent of the apartment she wanted to live in and thought it was beautiful. 

All modern amenities, contemporary decor, and a pretty large space. 

Because she’s in the city, one bedrooms run from $2,900 up. 

My husband said all her complaints were pretty ridiculous and that part of college is learning how to live with a community of people.

He also said that I should not pay for this apartment and that if she really wanted to move out of a habitable accommodation she should do it with her own money.

I work as well and have separate accounts from my husband. My stance was that the money from her grandma shouldn’t be used to pay for basic necessities. 

She buys most of her clothes and pays for her activities through her trust, and I don’t want her to have to worry about any college costs, since I promised to cover everything regarding her education.

So I ended up co-signing a lease to the apartment and paid for movers to bring her stuff from the dorm to her new apartment.

My husband said that was inappropriate and I should have asked him. I told him this was my daughter and it wasn’t up to him to determine what constituted spoiled and what didn’t.

266,YTA,AITA for saying my wife might be jealous of our daughter?,"My wife Liz had a horrible childhood. She was and is extremely intelligent. She's practically a human calculator as well as being able to speak several languages fluently. Her talents came out when she was very young and she did extremely well academically, passing all her exams early and even getting university offers in her early teens. Her parents put a huge amount of pressure on her. They forced her to study constantly and refused to let her see any of her friends or even leave the house at all during some periods. 

Liz eventually ran away from home and lived with a friend's family. Unfortunately the scars from her childhood still affect her. With her mind and her academic achievements, she could do anything she wants. Instead she works at the checkout in a shop. She only ever wears plain clothes and never wears jewellery or makeup. Obviously it isn't my place to tell her what to wear, but Liz actively doesn't want to stand out. She wants to blend in and be as average as possible, the opposite of what her parents wanted. 

We have a daughter, Claire, who is 18, and we were both adamant that she would get a normal childhood. She's got her mother's talents. From her early school years she was always top of the class. Her teachers even offered her to move up a couple of years because she's so advanced, but she turned it down to stay with her friends, which we respected. 

Claire is a very outgoing person. She loves going to parties and spending time with her friends, and is a happy, bubbly kid. She's still a high achiever and has applied to an elite university to study mathematics. 

Like many girls her age Claire is into fashion and clothes and shoes etc. Yesterday she asked Liz for money to buy some new stuff, which resulted in an argument between them when Liz said she's asking too often (she bought a few dresses last week). 

Later Liz was still annoyed, saying that Claire takes everything for granted and that she doesn't understand how comfortable her childhood has been. I asked Liz if she was sure she wasn't jealous of Claire and if she doesn't wish she had the life we've given her. 

Liz got extremely upset and asked how I could say that to her. She stormed off, and when I went to bed, she was crying and told me she wanted to be alone.

267,YTA,"AITA for getting mad that my ""Daughters Boyfriend"" got her a new and bigger bed","So my daughter Sam who is 25 in two weeks still lives at home with me. Apartment prices where we live are not the best for what you get. Sam has been wanting a new bed for years especially over the last 18 months or so since the wooden slats on her bed keep falling off or breaking. Sam has told me she's fed up off having to mend her bed at 3am and waking up with a bad back, because I refuse to allow her to get a new bed.

I never allowed her to get a new bed because her room was a mess, i always told her if she'd clean up her room, i'd look into getting her new slats for her bed.

So this week Sam has cleaned her room completely moved some things around and when i questioned her, she said she's woke up one to many times with a broken bed and wants to at least get her bed fixed. She also mentioned at around the same time, that her boyfriend had bought her a big present. that she didn't know what he had bought her just that it was the anniversary, birthday and Christmas gift combined.

So today, she was on edge always looking for the delivery of the present, i went out to work and about an hour after i left, she called and said that the present her boyfriend got her was a bed and it's not a cheap one either. I was honestly expecting another single bed but was really annoyed to find a massive double bed taking up most of my front room. (I told her to leave it in the packaging until i got home)

I mentioned to her that a bed was a weird gift, especially since he's never seen the her room before. and asked her if she bought it, which she obviously denied, told me i can check her bank statments and call her boyfriend if I want to check out her story. I expressed concern on whether it would fit in her room and told her we might have to completely rearrange her room again. Sam just looked at me as if i was stupid and reminded me of the plans she had to move some of the shelves, in theory her plan works but i'm not 100% sold.

when we went back down stairs, i asked Sam again if she had bought it and again she said no. I told her having a double bed is something couples have and she was livid. Apparently her friends had double beds in highschool, to which i replied they had bigger houses, which according to Sam is not the point and I should get rid of my King size bed according to my logic since I'm single. Sam has called me an asshole because i've replaced my bed twice in the last 10 years, but she's been stuck with her childhood bed.

268,YTA,AITA for “finessing” this kid for really expensive shoes and not giving them back?,"A couple days ago, me and my friends (M17&18) were just walking around in the city and when we were passing a skate park, I saw a kid skating in a really rare pair of shoes. I resell jordans, so I recognized them. I was kind of surprised that he would be skating in shoes going upwards of 2,000 dollars. 

So I went up to him and asked him if he would be willing to sell them because they were still in really good condition. (Estimated he wore them max 3 times) He said something like “are you sure u want these bro, I’ve skated in them and shit”. I told him yea and asked him how much he wanted. At this point, I realized for sure that he didn’t know how much they were worth because he said “well I paid retail on them which was like 190, so how about 140 since I wore them a couple times”. I countered at 110$ and we ended up meeting at 125$. I wanted to make sure they were authentic so i Legit checked them then gave the kid the money.

I recorded the whole exchange and posted it(kids identify was not revealed and he said I could) and while most people thought it was funny, some are saying I took advantage of the kid and I’m an asshole. To me, that really doesn’t make any sense because we  both agreed to the sale. Everyone should know the value of what they are wearing. It’s common sense. 

But here’s where the problem is. The video blew up and he saw it and contacted me saying he wants to “trade back”. The thing is I already cleaned the shoes up and am planning on selling them tomorrow. (Not for the full amount since he didn’t have the box/extra laces, but for a very good price). I told him all trades are final, and that’s where some people are saying I’m an asshole if I don’t give them back. So AITA?

My wife and I have never discussed getting our son an ATV or dirt bike, so I'm not sure exactly how she'll react, but based on some of her views it's more likely than not her response will be negative. I just don't know for sure. 

I have considered not telling her and just letting things play out on Christmas for a few reasons. I know our son will love it, and the ATV my parents bought is not that powerful so I don't have any real concerns about him getting hurt. I know my dad will watch him like a hawk, so I view it as unlikely he would ever get more than a scrap or bruise at this level. I also know how excited my parents are about getting him this gift, so I hate to take that away from them and spoil it.

270,YTA,AITA for feeling offended when someone implied I was a criminal?,"Last night I went to the local supermarket where my sister works. I pick up the handful of things that I need and I see that her checkout is empty, so I go to her to say hi. 

As I'm setting my things down on the counter, one of the supervisors comes over to us and says, ""employees aren't allowed to checkout items for relatives."" I'm like, what? He says it can't be done, it's a new rule they've instituted. So I immediately answer, ""if you're accusing me of something, say it openly."" He says he's not accusing me of anything, he just can't let me pay for my things with my sister.

So I respond, ""if you're not accusing me of anything, then there's no reason to keep me from passing through my sister's checkout. If you're doing so, it's because you think one of us are going to steal something or whatever. Either one or both of us are being insulted for no reason.""

He and my sister tell me that I can just go to the next checkout, but I'm really angry with this guy's presumption. Here's where I might be the asshole: I was so pissed at the way I was being treated that I threw my groceries on the floor, and said that I'd be going someplace where I wouldn't be accused of being a criminal. I went home thinking that my sister would be thanking me for standing up for her dignity, but she was PISSED, saying there was no need to cause a scene and that I'm not to set foot there again. 

There was no need to say that, I absolutely will not be going there again of my own volition. I may have been a bit harsh with the guy who was just doing his job, but as an employee of the company, he's a representative of the company. Hopefully word of this will go up to management and they'll withdraw this ridiculous rule that only serves to shame customers.",2020-10-26 01:59:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ji62pm/aita_for_feeling_offended_when_someone_implied_i/,694,1369,0.87,5
271,YTA,AITA for using spending time with my brother as punishment for my kids?,"Now I know this is a bit weird for this sub but I’m actually pretty certain that I am the asshole, but my older sister disagrees and thinks I was in the right.

My brother has a developmental disability and for whatever reason that makes him very socially awkward. When we were growing up he was just sort of there, and never shared anything with us.

So I don’t really ever know how to interact with him and my kids really don’t. He lives alone though and chooses to have no friends so I make sure to invite him to as much as possible.

And so as I was planning this festivity I told my kids that he would be there and they started to complain about how he’s weird and how he gets uncomfortable when they hug him and stuff like that.

I told them it was very rude that they’d think this way about someone different than them and they would perhaps should spend the whole day with him if they can’t be nice.

Well they gave up after that. We had a nice event and my brother seemed to have fun and my kids didn’t say much when he randomly left during conversations or when he didn’t get jokes, or even when he panicked when someone sat in his seat. I was really proud of my kids. 


After the event my oldest child came to me and said it was pretty bitchy to tell us we should be nice to someone who I considered a punishment to be around. 

My sister was still there and I asked her about it and she said that it wasn’t bad at all because he’s both family and truthfully quite painful to be around with his whines and staring and such.

But that wasn’t awfully convincing and I think I am the asshole but am I wrong ?",2020-11-27 16:10:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k23y96/aita_for_using_spending_time_with_my_brother_as/,160,244,0.89,0
272,YTA,AITA for telling my fiancé his sister can not come over anymore?,"My fiancé, Jake and I have been together for 4 years now. We had a little relationship in high school, but broke up and met again a few years later. I have a child(m6) from my previous relationship, and a toddler(m2) with Jake. 

Jake has a big, embracing family to say the least. His grandparents bought us the house that we’re living in, and since my oldest son’s dad isn’t in his life, Jake has completely stepped up. 

To get to the main point, jakes mom stays with us a few nights out of the week since she works right down the road and loves to spend time with the grandkids. I love her dearly and have no issue with her, and have even offered for her to move in. She watches the kids when she’s here and picks up too. 

Jakes little sister(f18), Sarah, comes over maybe once every other week. A few days ago, her boyfriend broke up with her and she spent the night at our house. I don’t have anything against his sister and she’s great with the kids. But she always asks her mom if she can come over, not me. I talked to jakes mom about this and jakes mom said that Sarah just assumes she asks me and Jake for her. I don’t like that. Today Sarah messaged me and apologized, and asked if she could come get her shoes she left from the other night. 

I said yea I guess. My oldest son missed her and I guess she told her mom she was coming by to see him. But he was doing homework and I wasn’t going to stop him. Sarah told Jake before leaving she was disappointed to not see my son but that she’d try to swing by again next week. I said absolutely not to Jake. She looked hurt and left and was crying. 

Jake went off on me and asked me why I did that, and I told him. She has no respect for my authority in the house and continues to go around me to ask permission. She asked today, LAST MINUTE. it’s just really disrespectful. Jake is sleeping on the couch and now I’m really wondering if I am in the wrong and if I should consider letting her come back over.

273,YTA,AITA for refusing to share my mom's recipes with my wife?,"My mom always cooked for our family a lot while she was alive and able. She developed a number of her own recipes but she also accumulated some from her mother and grandmothers as well as her mother in law (my grandma). Most were ""family"" recipes so she did not share them with anyone, but when she passed, she gave them to me but asked me not to share them with anyone.

Since the holidays are coming up and my mother won't be here to cook for the family this year, my wife has asked me to share my mom's recipes with her so she can make them. She loves to cook and would like to carry on my mom's traditions. I cook as well and had planned to take over the responsibilities myself, so I told her that there was no need for her to take over. She still wanted to help, but I told her that I could manage by myself. This led to an argument and eventually I had to admit that part of my reason for not sharing the recipes with her is to honor my mom's request.

She thinks I am being ridiculous by not sharing them with her, but my mom never gave her any of her recipes. If she wanted to share them, she would have. I also don't trust that my wife would keep them only to herself. I can see her sharing them with her friends or others, which my mom definitely did not want.

Things would be different if I didn't promise my mom that I would keep the recipes to myself, but I did so there's nothing I can do about it. Plus nothing is stopping my wife from doing her own take on them.

I don't see how what I am doing is making me an asshole under the circumstances, but do you agree?

I can't respond anymore because the mods here are tyrants and won't let me answer questions. Apparently they love the power trip because their personal lives give them no satisfaction. It's sad how easily power can be abused by those who feel they need to compensate for all they lack.

274,YTA,AITA for not telling my friend about my wedding,"Me: M29

Wife: 28

Friend: M30

One and a half years ago my friend moved countries for a job opportunity, and we still talk regularly over the internet. When he left, his then-girlfriend had to break up with him as she didn't see herself moving to another country. He still loved her a lot but he knew it was the right decision for both of them.

Few months after he left, me and his Ex really hit it off. We began dating behind his back and I didn't want to break the news to him, since he was still very attached to her. Fast forward a little less than a year later, and we're ultimately in love and want to get married. I buy her a ring, we get engaged, and Covid really started to get going. So in September we decided to not wait any longer and just have a small wedding without a ceremony, only my and her parents. The word gets out, and somehow my friend gets the news without us telling him. He went nuts and debated our yearlong friendship, I'll spare you the details.

Me and wife think we did the right thing by not hurting his feelings, and as he's on the other side of the world it should be none of his concern anyway. I know it's a hard thing for him to deal with, but that's just life.

She and I are going to married in a couple of months. We have an inside joke together that we’re allowed to fuck whoever we want the night before our wedding. We are both very aware it’s a joke and it’s not something we really want to try. 

We haven’t said actual names during the joke, yet but she was curious. She said she knows exactly who she would fuck. I asked her who, she said I’d have to tell her mine first. To be honest I had never really thought about who. But when she asked the first person that came to mind was her sister who is 5 years younger than her. I know this is probably fucked up. I rationalized by thing that since her sister looks like a younger version of her,  it’s like I’d just want to cheat on my fiancée with my fiancée when we first met. Which now I realize sounds pretty awful.

I didn’t say, and said I didn’t really know. She didn’t believe me for a second and kept asking. At one point she jokingly said, “Who knows? I might be able to hook you up with her”.  I guess she could tell on my face that I felt bad about who I thought. She said it’s okay because it’s just a joke and she wouldn’t be mad. I against my better judgement blurted out her sisters name. She stopped smiling and asked me, “What the fuck did you just say?” I went into panic mode and said the name of a celebrity, that didn’t help the situation. 

She was unbelievable upset that I said her sister. I tried to give her my rationalization, and that only upset her more. She was near tears and told me that I was such an asshole. I told her that she said it was a joke, and that She wouldn’t be upset over whoever i said. She said that hers was her hot high school teacher back from back when she was 17, and she couldn’t believe that I wanted to fuck her sister. Until last night I slept on the couch because of it, and she’s still sour to me about it.

Ive talked to some friends about it, my close friends that are women said I’m an asshole. My guy friends said I wasn’t an asshole but I’m stupid.

276,YTA,AITA for telling my wife I am disappointed she got pregnant so quickly?,"She's currently pregnant with our third (and last) child. Our other two were also conceived quickly. The first was conceived in our second cycle of trying and the second in our first. This child was also conceived in our first cycle of trying. It's honestly shocking given how many couples we know that were past six months when they finally conceived. 

I don't want to seem ungrateful, because I know many couples would be thrilled with our luck, but I feel like we (or at least I) missed out on the fun part of trying to conceive since it happened so quickly and then everything shifted into pregnancy/baby mode. In addition, typically there's been no boost to my wife's sex drive during pregnancy, so we didn't even get to experience that. I wouldn't change anything if I could just so we're clear, but I am still disappointed that we didn't get to have more carefree sex. 

Ever since my wife told me she was pregnant again, I haven't been able to stop thinking about this and my disappointment. I've tried to avoid it and not dwell on it, but evidently I didn't do a good job of either because it's still there and I can't help but feel that I missed out. It may be worse this time because I know that the door is closed now and that's it. 

My wife could tell I was ""off"" and kept pressing. I didn't want to admit what was bothering me because I felt like she'd think I was being petty, but after she started to worry that I might not want the baby I told the truth. It helped but she still was upset, as I expected. She said that this was an incredibly selfish view to have because it was me prioritizing sex over her well being (i.e. TTC is stressful for her so I was in a way willing to trade her mental wellbeing for pleasure).

I don't agree with that view at all. In fact, I think it's a pretty ridiculous way to look at the situation and probably is the most negative take on my feelings. I'm saying ideally we could have had more carefree sex and enjoyed this experience more, which also includes no stress or anxiety. I would never trade pleasure for her mental health, so I'm surprised that she really thinks I would do that if given the choice. I just think she's taken my feelings completely out of context and has unfairly labeled me the asshole.

277,YTA,AITA for taking my girlfriend engagement ring shopping but not having a plan for when to propose?,"Throwaway. On mobile. 

Back in August, I took my girlfriend engagement ring shopping. After a couple of stores, we found the perfect one—we both really love it and it’ll be the ring I eventually buy for her. We’ve been talking more seriously about getting engaged since June. 

A few weeks after we picked out the ring (I haven’t bought it yet), she asked me if I knew when I was going to propose. I said that I hadn’t given the timeline a ton of thought, which was the truth. She was upset about that and told me that it was unfair for me to get her hopes up by going ring shopping, but she dropped it after I told her I’d propose “soon.” Fast forward to last week, she asked me again, and I told her I wasn’t sure when. She wasn’t happy with that answer. She again said that I had gotten her hopes up and it was unfair to shop for a ring if I wasn’t going to propose soon or if I didn’t have a plan.

I love my girlfriend. She’s amazing and I could go on for days about how lucky I am to have her. I am going to propose to her one day, I’m just don’t know when. She is uncomfortable with not knowing when things will happen in her life so I’m not exactly surprised by her response. We’ve had the same argument about her moving in (she’s been staying with me pretty much exclusively since August, but I haven’t asked her to officially move in yet, so she still has her place). I want her to live with me, it be been going well so far, I just don’t have a timeline in my head if when she should officially move in. She’s on a month by month lease so it’s not like we need to really plan anything out as long as we give her landlord 30 days notice. 

I was talking to my friend and his wife about this and they think I’m being unfair. But I’m just not the kind of person to make plans ahead of time. In my mind, when it’s the right time to propose, I’ll just know and then it’ll happen. I don’t feel like I should have to plan out a timeline. My girlfriend says that she feels like I’m leaving her hanging off a cliff and that it’s hard for her to have this much uncertainty.

278,YTA,AITA: For planning to emigrate in order to avoid paying off my student loans? My friend thinks so.,"I'm the child of  immigrants that has lived his entire life in the US  so I've always been one of those bilingual and bicultural kids. Recently I've started to appreciate the privileges presented to you when  you're from an immigrant family. The biggest one by far is that your world is much bigger than that of other people's. I have both US and EU citizenship which is basically most of the developed world and I have all the sweet benefits offered to the citizens of both places.

I will graduate college in May 2021 but I've been dreading the thought of paying off my student loans for a while now. However, I found a pretty sweet loophole which is only available for people in my shoes; I can simply emigrate from the US to Europe, ""pay off"" my loans through IBR (aka- legally not pay anything), and just enjoy life in Europe. My plan is both legitimate and legal.

When I told my plans to my college friend he thought I was joking and then he got mad at me when he realized that I'm serious. He basically said that my actions are unfair to those who can't leave America and have to live with their loans for decades. Although he's more progressive than me politically he said I will be a burden on American taxpayers who will have to pay for me and other people from immigrant families who take advantage of the good things America offers and then go back when it is time to return the favor.

So my friend basically that that I'm using my ""child of immigrants"" privilege to work my way around the system, but I feel like what I'm doing is totally legitimate. It's not like the entire student loans crisis is the fault of people like me. It's the fault of the system which encourages young people to make financially life altering decisions at an age when they should only be focused on their education. Ever since I was young it was pumped into me that I need to go to college to have a chance at having a good life. So I went to college, I'll soon get my degree, and I will now do what I must to have that good life.

Edit: Some of the answers have forced to me to reflect on my decision. I think overall I am asshole simply because I am not paying back what I owe to the US as a whole. It's not something I want to do but it's my best option and I feel like if I stay I'm being an asshole to my parents with whom I'll have to live with for the next decade or more. I would go back in time and do my bachelors in Europe if I could but I can't change the past and I can only work to make the future better. The student loan crisis in America is a travesty and I wish that all students could just finish their studies and not have to be in debt for decades.

279,YTA,AITA for going to a football game instead of spending the day celebrating my wife's pregnancy after she just found out?,"I normally have season tickets to my alma mater's football games, but this year they didn't do season tickets. Instead they did a lottery for each game. I've entered several times but haven't been selected. The same is true for a friend of mine until this past week. He got tickets to the game yesterday and asked me if I wanted to go. It was fine with my wife because we didn't have plans, so I told him that would be fine. 

My wife and I have been trying for a baby, and as luck would have it, she found out yesterday morning before I left. She told me right away and we had a little time to celebrate, but then I had to leave to meet my friend. I asked her before I left if she wanted me to stay, and she said no. Go to the game and have fun. Under different circumstances I would have stayed and spent the day focusing on her pregnancy news, but this is probably the only game I'll attend this year and I doubt I'll attend any next year since we'll have a baby. 

I went but when I got home she was cold and distant. Then when I woke up this morning she'd left and gone over to her mom's, which is where she spent the day. She didn't talk to me much when she got home, but she was upset because I went to the game instead of celebrating my wife's pregnancy. She thinks I should have insisted that I stay home and focus on that instead. 

The thing is, we could have celebrated today as well. We could have even done it last night. Nothing prevented that except her bad mood. I think her attitude about the whole situation is ridiculous and she has no right to call me the asshole because there were plenty of ways we could have celebrated and she even told me to go. It seems like she's really upset with herself and blaming me, but that's not my fault, I think.

280,YTA,AITA for buying an investment property and kicking out a tenant?,"Hello reddit,

I'm a young person and I'm looking to buy a rental property as an investment. After searching for months, I've found an incredible opportunity with a specific property. It has 4 units which are all currently rented out. 3 of those units have fair market rent and 1 of those units has an individual who is paying 50% of market rent for the unit because he's been there for 10 years. He knows the previous landlord well and was able to get a great deal when he first moved in and the seller hasn't raised the rent on him since.

Now, in order for the investment to be worthwhile for me I would need to evict this tenant in order to raise the rents. I can evict the tenant legally by claiming to move in, moving in for a while and then turning around and re-renting the unit once he's gone. I wouldn't mind moving in temporarily either while I find someone else to rent, I could use the time to paint and modernize the unit.

That being said, I could just opt to invest in another property where I don't have to evict someone from their unit. This would mean I would make less money but there are still other profitable units out there. Realistically, any other investor would do the same but I'm questioning whether I want to participate in this type of behavior.

AITA for wanting to invest in this property, leading to this guy getting evicted out of his apartment?

**Edit**: Specifically, I know that this is the way life and capitalism are but I'd like to engage the question on a moral level? Am I doing some unethical?

**Edit x2:** To clarify, I haven't done this yet and I'm asking because I'm conflicted. I know for a fact that there are other offers on the property that stipulate this tenant needs to leave before assuming the property. There is also the point to consider that because I am sensitive to this, I would give this tenant time and flexibility to leave whereas others might be more draconian in their approach. Either way, I'm asking this because I don't feel comfortable and am trying to examine the ethicality of the situation.

**Edit x3:** Wow.. the responses have been overwhelming to say the least. Let me clarify a few things that I've seen come up a few times in the comments.

1. In my jurisdiction, I can't simply raise the rent to market rates when the tenant's lease is up. There is a maximum rent increase of 2.5%/year here. If I tried to raise the rent by the legal limit, it would take me until 2050 to reach 2020 market rent, not factoring inflation.
2. I know the tenant has a stable job with decent pay and could afford to pay market rents.
3. I wouldn't be doing anything that is illegal. I would move into the unit as my full-time place of residence for as long as legally required. Sorry if this wasn't clear in the original post.

**Finally, I have decided NOT to pursue this investment**. For me, the most important argument is that I will be causing this tenant great discomfort by uprooting them from the life that they've become so familiar with. And further, I'd only be doing it to make some extra money which I'm fortunate enough to not need. No, I'm not ""rich"" by any means but I do have enough to cover my needs and have some runway in case of emergencies. I'd much rather make less money (or no money) in an ethical way and hopefully a better opportunity will come along in the future.",2020-11-03 23:16:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jnlb10/aita_for_buying_an_investment_property_and/,437,874,0.9,1
281,YTA,AITA for falsifying my son's DNA test?,"LONG Story.

My twin brother was a hot mess and died of a drug overdose in 2009. His girlfriend announced she was pregnant and gave birth in back of an abandon bus. Obviously she lost custody. I was next of kin so I adopted my nephew although we refer each other as father/son and he is doted by everyone.

My son was diagnosed with a rare form of diabetes (diabetes inspidious) last year which his doctor told him was genetic. I have NO one with that in my family I mentioned it was probably from his mother's side. That sparked an interest in learning about his family tree. He asked for a 23andme DNA test which I gladly bought for him knowing it would show people from our side of the family. Nothing shocking.

Well I was SHOCKED. When his results were ready, I viewed them before he did. He is not blood related. He is basically Russian and  Ashkenazi on the paternal side when it shows German and English on my side. It made sense. He looks nothing like me or his birth mom. This doesn't change anything, but it would destroy him to find out. He was wishing that there would be one family member  with their shit together and maybe give him a sense of history.

My kid wanted to see the results himself so I showed him mine pretending it was his. He thought it was the coolest thing ever.

I feel guilty beyond belief because he and I have always had a transparent relationship and I am here deceiving him.",2020-11-13 03:41:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jt9wwk/aita_for_falsifying_my_sons_dna_test/,171,1449,0.96,3
282,YTA,AITA for telling my nephew to either get a haircut or find somewhere else to stay?,"My nephew (Andy) moved in with my wife and I about three months ago. He came out as bisexual to his parents and unfortunately for him, it didn't go down to well. My wife (his blood aunt) was too kind to just stand by and watch her nephew struggle so we took him in.

He was great at first. He is 17 so our kids (5F, 8M & 10M) took to him instantly and saw him as their ""cool"" cousin. He is great with the kids and had no issues babysitting them for us. I can't really complain about the boys behaviour. He's polite, kind and just generally a nice boy.

Everything was absolutely fine for the first month but after a while, my middle son started acting up. Andy has very long (often dyed) hair, around waist length. Our 8yo started asking if he was allowed to have hair like his cousins. He would complain constantly that he didn't have ""cool"" hair and whenever we told him he can't grow his hair out at the minute, he'd have a complete tantrum (he's 8, not a baby). Andy and our 10yo were the only two that could calm him down from these tantrums as he didn't want to speak to us, we were the ones that told him no after all. He, like our other kids, goes to a private school and whilst long hair is not against any rules, it is frowned upon as they don't think it looks very smart.

Anyway, this continued for a long while. Until a couple of days ago. My 8yo all but strutted into the room and told us that he can have his hair however he wants when he's bigger and there's nothing his ""stupid mum and dad"" can do about it. When I asked him where he got that idea from, he said Andy told him.

I spoke to Andy and (though I know he didn't say the stupid mum and dad part) he admitted that he'd told his cousin that when he was older he'd be able to do whatever he wants with his hair. Which is fine, he can have long hair when he's older if he wants, but our 8yo has started telling us all of the things he can do when he's older and how we can't do anything about it. Just generally getting quite an attitude. I do blame Andy for this, he should've just told him that he couldn't have long hair. It all came to a head yesterday when I snapped at Andy when he was brushing out his hair (and getting comments from our son about how jealous he was of his hair). I was sick of all the hair talk so I yelled at my nephew and told him he could either get his hair cut to an normal length or he could find somewhere else to stay. I was sick of my son acting like a jealous little girl. No kid should be that fixated on hair for god's sake.

My wife and I had a fight, she thinks I was completely in the wrong. Andy hasn't spoken to me at all. He didn't even argue back. That's what makes me regret my outburst a bit, he looked so sad. I didn't mean it and if he tries to speak to me I will apologise sincerely. But I do think the silent treatment is a bit over the top, he knows I wouldn't try to hurt him on purpose. AITA?

Edit/Small update -

Okay I tried to read all the comments. It hurts to read all the YTA's but you guys are right. I was an absolute asshole. I let my wife read through some of them and she agrees with what you guys are saying.

I decided to be the adult and go talk to Andy. I apologised for what I did and told him that I really don't have any issue with his hair, I was just stressed out with my 8yo's behaviour and I lashed out at him. It was not right and I should never have done it, I wish I could take it back but I can't.  In turn, Andy told me that he'd been absolutely terrified that he was going to get kicked out, poor boy even had a bag pack just waiting for me to ask him to leave. He told me he felt that I didn't want him in my house and that I thought he was a burden.  I have never felt more disgusted in myself, I have unintentionally been making him think that he wasn't welcome, way before I lashed out at him.

I had a chat with my wife (apologised to her) and we're currently looking online for new wallpaper and stuff, we want to decorate the guest bedroom that Andy's staying in to make it his bedroom, then hopefully he'll feel more welcome in his new home. I admit it was my wife's idea but I wholeheartedly support it. Andy and I are going to go out shopping for some smaller things for his room (posters,lamps etc.) and just have some time to bond.

Things are going a lot better. I spoke to my 8yo about his attitude problem. Like someone suggested, I told him he can grow his hair out over the summer holidays if he wants but he has to stop being so cheeky to myself and his mum and the tantrums have to stop. This has cheered him up a great deal.

Over all I am glad I posted here, I really needed the reality check. I know I got pretty defensive at first, I hope you folks can forgive me for that.

283,YTA,AITA for asking my granddaughter to help out more around the house?,"My granddaughter recommended I join this website and ask for opinions.

I'm retired and live on my own. My granddaughter moved from across the country before Coronavirus began, and when it started, she moved in with me to keep me company. She has a dog and a cat that have moved with her. She pays me $100 a week for board & lodgings.

Since July, she's been going to study four days a week, 9-3, and since September, one day of study, 9-1, and four days of work practical, 8.30-5.30.

I make her smoothies in the morning every day, but when she's at home on the weekends, she always conveniently forgets to wash out the blender. And when she has a plate of hers to wash, she never does any of the other dishes in the sink. I cook most nights and she does the dishes afterwards, but I've told her that she is to start cooking on Mondays too, since she finishes study at 1pm.

I do all the cleaning, except every second Saturday, she mops the whole house. She is to keep her two rooms clean and vacuum the floors and keep the windows open for fresh air. I do all the washing and maintenance around the house. She is to fold up her own clothes and put them away. Her dog and cat are her responsibility, she has to feed them, wash them, and clean up their poop.

But when she gets home, she immediately leaves the house to avoid helping me with cooking or folding clothes and goes for a ride with her dog. After she returns, she just eats dinner, does the dishes, and goes on her computer for the rest of the night! And on the weekends, she's always in the spare room on her computer playing games or out on her scooter with her dog.

She never says goodnight and I find her already asleep when I check in on her. She always says she's tired from practical or doing her assessments, and then she drives an hour to the city to hang out with friends or get a haircut.

She never wants to help out and it's already a hassle to get her to cook one meal a week. I started telling her to do her own washing loads, and she says she doesn't have the time or energy to do it. And when I asked her to start gardening as well, she flat out refused and said I should do it because I'm home all the time.

284,YTA,AITA for telling my gf she was acting like a thot?,"Gf, two of her gal pals, and I went out to a Mexican restaurant(I know, there is pandemic) and my gf got drunk as fuck. Gf is not a drinker in the slightest but decided to give it a try. It had been a very stressful year for her because her father had passed(not due to the pandemic) so she kinda wanted to let loose a bit and try drinking. She liked the taste of my margarita  so she got some herself. She was gulping them down like juice because”This is good! It doesn’t even really taste too alcoholly.” We tried to warn her but to no avail. She gulps a couple down much quicker than you should and gets drunk as fuck. My normally sweet and shy gf apparently is a freak on the inside because it gets let loose. She starts talking extremely loudly, randomly throwing her head side to side, tries to get all frisky with me, gives one of her friends a lap dance, and tells our waiter he has a nice butt. Thankfully the waiter didn’t mind and laughed it off(I think he thought my gf was cute or something but whatever) It’s all good fun for the time but we decide it’s time to go so we head out after paying.

We’re dragging my gfs along while we head to the car. Gf is playfully trying to grab all our butts the whole time. We get to where we parked. Gf starts twerking up on the side walk. It’s in a busy area and a bunch of people are looking at my gf. I think enough of this drunk behavior now. I go to grab my gf to put her in the car. I tell her”Alright babe that was fun but enough acting like a thot.” Her friends, who were enjoy her drunk antics, get on my case for this. All like “Why you calling her a thot?” “She’s just having fun being drunk for the first time, don’t call her that.” I didn’t say she was a thot, just that she was kinda acting like one for a little too long. Gf is too drunk to care.

Fast forward to next day, gf is hungover and feeling tired but she learns from her friends about the thot thing. Well she is pissed. I again tell her that I didn’t call her one, just that she acted like one for too long. Gf is angry now saying things like”I was just trying to release stress and now I got my bf calling me a whore.” She says this nearly in tears. I really think she is completely overreacting.

285,YTA,WIBTA if I kept my dog against my wife's wishes?,"Dog tax:  http://imgur.com/a/aPq76o0

My wife and I have a values difference regarding pets, combined with a health issue, which has left us at an impasse.

The getting-a-dog part of the story:

(Note: the following is simplified)

A few years ago, my wife and son decided in favor of getting a dog ""eventually."" We weren't going to go dog shopping or anything, but we'd keep our eyes open for a good opportunity. I was ecstatic - I love dogs and have wanted one for a while.

About a year ago, I found a few puppies being mistreated near my work. Long story short, she agreed to keep the one I'd gotten attached to. I knew she wasn't exactly enthusiastic, but I figured that was mostly due to the surprise factor.

Since she wasn't hugely into the idea of getting a dog, the deal was that the dog would be a combination of my and our son's responsibility. He's 9, so naturally, more on me. I readily agreed.

For many months, this went great. We had long walks together, I took care of all the training and stuff, things were going wonderfully. My wife even grew to ""appreciate"" the dog, even if not exactly love him.

So, I'd believed that she had fully agreed to the commitment that is getting a dog, even if things didn't go quite like we'd envisioned.

The problem:

A few months ago, a weird nerve thing happened in my back/leg and it's causing me a hell of a lot of trouble. Walking is really difficult. I've got an MRI scheduled, but it's months away, since it's non emergency.

We're in our 30's, and my health isn't exactly fantastic, so we're worried that this isn't going to be fixable, and it'll be my new normal. At the moment, that means my wife has to pick up the dog walking duty. My son's too young to do that on his own. I'm still doing everything else.

She didn't ""sign up for this,"" and doesn't want to do it. She wants to get rid of him. (Note: not get rid of him *now.* But if I don't recover and can't resume walks. This is a future possibility, not an immediate thing.)

To me, once you get a pet, that pet is family. You don't get rid of a pet for any reason short of ""we really have no choice."" Now, this really isn't ideal, and I get that.

Her perspective is: it would be bad for him to not get regular walks. Thus, that would be mistreating him. Thus, it would be better to get rid of him. She sees it as 3 options - we mistreat her (by forcing her to go on walks), we mistreat the dog, or we let him go.

Which I totally, completely understand. That said... deep down, I feel like that's just not something that's done. You don't get rid of pets if it's reasonably possible to keep them.

FWIW, my son is also firmly against getting rid of the dog.

We have come up with a tentative arrangement until the MRI results come in, at least. So it's not immediate.

I want to push to keep finding arrangements that involve us keeping the dog, even if he doesn't get as many walks as is ideal, even if it puts extra responsibilities on my wife. (We've ""traded"" some chores, so she doesn't have a net increase of responsibility. She just doesn't like spending time with him. She likes watching us play with him, but doesn't want to do anything with him herself.)

WIBTA for pushing for that outcome?

(Note: specifically, I'm asking if my feelings / values are a valid moral foundation. Is it reasonable to treat this as a moral issue, as opposed to pure logistics. I'm not asking if it's okay to force her to do things. That's obviously not okay. If she puts her foot down, obviously she is the priority here.)

INFO: since it's been brought up a bit, I figured I'd mention that the dog is a big (80 lbs) husky cross. (Note: he's a mutt. We believe he has a decent chunk (no more than 1/4) of husky or Malamute, but it's a guess)  A little neighborhood walk doesn't do any good. Seriously, 2 hours and he's still full of energy. His walks are off leash in the woods, only thing that wears him out. That's why my son can't walk him.

And we can't afford a dog walker, aside from occasionally.",2020-11-24 02:09:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jzvy7d/wibta_if_i_kept_my_dog_against_my_wifes_wishes/,220,167,0.93,0
286,YTA,AITA for choosing my son's subjects for him.,"Sorry for the throw away, I  do not want this to be associated with my real account if I am the asshole.So my 14 year old son just finished his 1st year of high school and we got subjects we are able to choose for the following years. They have 12 subjects but they would be reduced to 8. My son likes Physics but in a couple of years physics will get much harder, so I removed Physics and he would do Biology and Chemistry. He likes Computer Science but Business and Accounting has more career opportunities so I removed Computer Science, I had to choose between Geography and Christianity , he is Christian so I selected that. Apparently he did not like this subjects and he came to my room in panic that he had been told he had to do Biology, Business and Accounting and Christianity instead of his favourite subjects. I admitted it that I chose it for him and he begged me to change it. I changed it but my wife keeps telling me that I am terrible and that I broke my son's trust. In my opinion I just chose what I thought was best for him but she says that it was so messed up of me to do it without asking him. I do not think I broke his trust and I rectified m problem so I do not think I am the asshole but my wife keeps insisting I am. So AITA for choosing my sons subjects for him. BTW  these subjects influence what you can choose as a career and my son wants to be a software engineer so that is why my wife thinks I broke his trust and I am the asshole.

EDIT: I talked to my son after he finished playing games with his friends, I apologised and we discussed what he wants to do. He wants to do software engineering. I understand why the statistics for CS students are bad now. We have about 2 million graduates every year from high school and most of them chose CS as it is considered easier and less boring. They go to university and then flood the job market. The number of jobs are not very high  but higher than B&A . Many of them remain unemployed because all of the jobs are taken. B&A are much less and  get job easily. It makes sense now . My son wants to move to Germany and apply for citizenship. I will get him a tutor to teach him German, I bought him a Udemy course for now. I think I will be able to support him moving there because  we got  an education plan when he was a child and it has enough money to let him live there. I also got him a subscription to brilliant, which is something he has wanted since he was 11. I am going to take him to code camp after covid( spend 2 months learning how to code). I realised how little I talk to him and i will spend more time with him. He forgave me.

I understand why I am the Asshole and thank you all for giving me different perspectives on the issue.

My friend (27F) and I (24F) were at my apartment just hanging out and talking about stuff when my boyfriend came and asked if I needed anything because he was going out to check on his friend who recently gave birth. I said no and he left. My friend 'Ally' then said how she hates how lucky some people are and unlucky she is. I asked what she was talking about and she said her inability to have her own children and the endless hoops she needs to jump to adopt when all she really wants is a child and now because the timing is perfect and her life will be afterwards (she's infertile due to a childhood accident). I joked about how much I'd hate being pregnant or being a mother. I've practically raised my siblings and that's my fair share for this lifetime. She said that I was lucky and that wished she could get pregnant like me. So I said that I considered her lucky and wished that I could be infertile so my boyfriend and I wouldn't have to be so crazy with this double protection thing since we both don't want kids but I don't want to be put in the position to abort because I honestly don't know what I'd do. 

She just stared at me and said that what I said was a bitch thing to say since I know how much she wants children yet I'm acting like it's comparable to to me not wanting kids when mines a choice, and all so my boyfriend and I could ""fuck raw"". I said that was disgusting and 'kicked' her out (told her to leave). Our friends have been on my arse though about how insensitive and inconsiderate I was to her condition by saying I wished I was infertile and had the audacity to kick her out when she pointed out my behavior.

291,YTA,AITA for telling my heavily pregnant neighbor to shut the f#ck up?,"The title makes me sound like a horrible person. Please read before you make a definite judgement. 

I (22M) live in an 'indoor' apartment building, like the kind you see on FRIENDS. My next door neighbor is heavily pregnant, and the father of her baby (and on-and-off boyfriend) dumped her a few weeks prior to my making this post. 

How do I know this? Well, it's just one of the many personal things that she told me. 

My neighbor, who I shall call Lynne, is always lingering around my apartment, and always somehow knows when I'm leaving. Whenever I go to grocery shop, Lynne manages to catch me both on the exit and return trip, and talks my ear off. Whenever I go to my friends' house for band practice (five times a week, but possibly all seven, depending) she is right there in the hallway. She has told me many personal things that I have no business knowing, and quite frankly, don't wanna know, such as - her rocky childhood, previous boyfriends that have been abusive, her recent ex who dumped her, her 'sexcapades', and so many other things. 

I have tried to be friendly and politely remove myself from the situation, but there's a reason that I live alone, and I just couldn't anymore. Multiple times, I have used the fire escape outside of my window just to be left alone. I feel sorry for Lynne, but I don't actually like her, and don't have any interest in hearing her talk whatsoever. Does that make me a jerk? Possibly. But just you wait-

Lynne has, multiple times, knocked on my door, asking if she could have some of the meals that I make because she can smell them through the vents. She has asked that I stay over with her at night because she's scared to be alone since we live in a horrible part of the city, and then when I try to refuse, cries and whines until I agree. I have gone to the store several times for her, I've somehow ended up at a few ultrasound appointments (I think that's the correct term) and have even lended her money for baby supplies. 

Earlier today, she approached me while I was leaving to check the mail and started to talk about her mom, who doesn't seem like a pleasant lady but is, apparently, 'stable'. She ranted and raved for a few minutes before I finally said - (I'm paraphrasing here, since I can't remember exactly) - ""Can you just shut the fuck up and leave me alone already? I'm not your husband."" 

As you can expect, she got quite upset, and went back into her apartment. I don't know how I should feel about that, but I'm feeling a little guilty. I know that I'm a jerk, but am I the asshole here?

EDIT- For everybody who keeps theorizing that I'm the dad of this baby - I'm asexual, and haven't had sex in two years. SHE WAS PREGNANT WHEN SHE MOVED IN!

292,YTA,AITA for giving an ‘engagement gift’ to only the groom-to-be and not giving anything to his fiancé?,"So I (28F) been close friends with my friend Jack (27M) for more than a decade. He lives in a different city now while I still live in our hometown, but we still talk everyday and are basically each other’s confidantes.

Last year Jack began dating Ashley (26F) and within two months of seeing each other, they moved in together and Jack told me that he really thinks that Ashley is the one. I was happy for Jack because he’s been through a string of toxic relationships before Ashley, and based on the things he tells me about her, she seems like a stable and sweet person. 

To this day, I have never met nor talked to Ashley for even 15 seconds. Whenever Jack visits our hometown to see his mother, he goes alone or when he’s with Ashley they just stay for just a few hours and Jack never invites me or our other friends to meet Ashley. I don’t ask if I could meet up with them because Jack’s mother is going through chemo so I thought maybe Jack wants to spend the limited time they have with his mom.

Jack, his friend Tom and I also play video games online regularly, but he doesn’t include Ashley in our conversations when we do voice coms, even though I know she’s just nearby because I can hear her talking to him. Sometimes I say “Hi Ashley!” when I hear her in the background and she replies with “Hello Nikki!”, but that’s it. Neither of us has really made any effort to know the other better - I guess we were fine with just knowing each other as Jack's girlfriend and Jack's friend.

So a few weeks ago Jack suddenly messaged me asking about engagement rings. I asked if he was popping the question to Ashley, and he said yes. I was really happy for Jack, and I decided that I would buy the watch that he wants but hasn’t been able to afford. That way, he can have something he wants for himself after shelling out three grand for an engagement ring. The watch is about $800, which was not spare change for me, but it’s for someone I consider to be my younger brother so I’m fine with spending a bit this time.

Jack proposed to Ashley last Friday (October 23). I ordered the watch in October 9 and it arrived at Jack’s house last Sunday. While he sounded excited when he thanked me for my gift, Tom later told me that Jack and Ashley fought about it. Apparently Ashley got mad because I gave Jack an ‘engagement gift’ while I didn’t get her anything.

My boyfriend told me that what I did was insensitive, I should apologize to Ashley and send her something. To be honest, I don’t understand it though. I didn’t send them an engagement gift that only Jack can use, I just sent my friend a personal gift. I will get them an engagement gift that is for both of them and both of them can use when they have their engagement party. I don’t know why Ashley expects me to send her a personal gift either if that’s the case, because we don’t even have a relationship.

293,YTA,AITA for refusing to apologise for calling my DIL's name suggestion for my grandson nonsensical?,"My daughter in law is currently about 6 months pregnant and we've been having discussions about the baby's name. They wanted it to be a family naming thing where both families sat and brainstormed names to help connect us more through their son. They came over to my wife and I's house and we started talking names. Her family is Turkish so they were suggesting these Turkish names and we were suggesting English names and neither were unanimously happy with any name. Then my DIL suggested the name ""Kaaniel"". I repeated it and she 'corrected' me by saying it in the exact same way I did. I said that sounded weird and I asked what it meant and she just paused and kept looking left and right so I asked if it was some made up name because I didn't want my grandson walking around with some nonsensical name just so he could be different. 

I believe that my tone wasn't that strong or intense but she looked down and then awkwardly left the room. Then my son explained that the name was a combination of Kaan (Turkish) and ""iel"" (from Gabriel or Daniel) which would roughly mean ""God is my ruler"" if I remember correctly and my dil's mother then said the name again with better pronunciation like ""kaan*yal*"" which was different to my DIL's ""aa"" sound which was short like ""kan"" and ""eel"" instead of ""yal"". Hard to explain the linguistics but it sounded better and we all liked the meaning. We then spoke about other things.

Later I find out that DIL was crying where she was because she felt I was insulting her idea by calling it nonsensical, making her feel stupid and apparently shut it down as if I actually had vetoing powers when it came to the name. I don't get the point of suggestions if she's going to get upset over mine and if I was honestly that dismissive her mother would've said something but I had no objections apologizing if she was that upset by it. That was until my son mentioned that she doesn't want to use the name now because I can't call something nonsense then flip the script and like it. Furthermore she'd like my wife and I not to be involved in the naming process until I've apologized and 'showed understanding of my role'.

4.) She refuses to wear anything less than a long-sleeved shirt, pants and socks even during summer. Often wearing ratty old clothes over and over again. This makes it difficult for my family to go out and do anything if it isn’t winter because it is too hot for her to come dressed like that. 

5.) She does poorly at school and wastes her education, she often doesn’t even hand in assignments on time and skips class (causing me to have to speak to her teachers about it), some days she outright refuses to go to school. 

6.) On top of all this, you can’t have a conversation with her at all, it is like talking to a brick wall... a brick wall that can’t stand a second talking to you. You can just tell she can’t stand you or anyone in the family for that matter. She is always curt and angry with me. Sometimes she is huffing and puffing in anger, but she always talks to me in an angry, curt tone. 

I’m really sick of it. On the way home from school while she was in the car I asked her to please just wear her eye contacts and eat with us at dinner and just try to be normal. I don’t think that I am the asshole for this but my husband says that I shouldn’t have used the word “normal” because he thinks it’s implying to her that she’s abnormal, but she is and I think she knows that.

296,YTA,AITA for not *always* using my nephew's 'real' name?,"(Got permission from the mods to repost this as the first was accidentally deleted before I could get an  official verdict.)

Family is very important to most of my, well, family. The exception is my sister who developed a different sort of values system once she left home. I still love her absolutely but there's some friction there to start with.

A few years ago she and her husband adopted a child. She's perfectly capable of having biological children and she and her husband would make amazing parents, this was some sort of 'moral' choice on their part but I think calling it a 'protest' would be more accurate.

The kid came with a name that's traditional to where it came from and definitely stands out as non-native where I live. (Before the Americans start, no, this isn't a black vs white thing. Think more Wojciech vs. Walter.) She refused any advice to rename him.

The issue then: when I'm talking to friends and colleagues I use a different name for my nephew. One that's traditional to our country and that fits in with the names of the rest of my family. It saves having to answer awkward questions or talk about the adoption and is just easier all round. These are people who 100% are never going to meet this kid, it doesn't effect him or my sister in any way at all.

My sister found out (through some thoughtless comment from our father) and was incredibly angry, went on a huge rant that unnecessarily dragged up a lot of her other general issues about me and our family and is refusing to come to Christmas. Not sure what her husband thinks as we don't get on too well to begin with.

She also tried to argue that this has something to do with the fact that he's adopted, but if she'd named a biological child this I'd have done exactly the same thing. Whether it's fine to name your child anything you want is something different people seem to disagree on (not many people are going to defend a name like Sephiroth right?) which is another reason I'm asking here.

Obviously I understand names and identity are important, or I wouldn't have done this to begin with. But I never use this 'fake' name when I see my nephew or my sister. He's totally unaware, it's a completely victimless crime and she could just think of it as a harmless nickname without melting down like this. I want to keep the peace but it seems ridiculous to go back to all these people who, again, are never going to meet my nephew and issue a redaction.

I'd like to add, which I forgot to originally, when they adopted him he was too young to know his own name.

I think I might be the asshole because I did realize my sister probably wouldn't be happy if she found out and I really *don't* want to upset her. But otoh feels like a mountain/molehill situation at this point.

Reddit verdict then? AITA for not always using my nephew's birth name?

Edit: People keep commenting on the 'it' thing so I just wanted to clarify, it was bad grammar on my part, the 'it' was supposed to be referring to the name, not my nephew.

Edit 2: Just for the record, I do love my nephew and consider him very much part of our family - our culture *is* his culture now, using a different name is a reflection of that. I don't expect verdicts to change, just don't want people to think I don't' care about the little guy.

Edit 3: I know how frustrating it is reading posts where the person just refuses to accept their verdict so I just wanted to say - I've read most of your replies and I'm going to try and come to some sort of understanding with my sister. Family is the most important thing and if I hurt her I need to put other things aside.

297,YTA,Aita for confronting my neighbor about her husband (police officer) giving my stepson a speeding ticket?,"This just happened, also, throwaway account. 

A little backstory: I live with my husband and 2 stepchildren. I can’t get pregnant and I’ve been a mother figure in his kids lives for the past 10 years or so. They are 17 and 13. I’ll call the 17 year old Jason. We have been living in our current house since 2014 and are still the newest to the block. We are on good terms with the neighbors, but not necessarily friends besides one couple. They are all very good people and always willing to lend a hand. 

Our neighbors from 4 houses down are a younger husband and wife. They have 2 little girls that stepdaughter babysits for pretty frequently. Maybe not weekly but biweekly atleast. The husband is a police officer for the next town over, and the wife has actually gone out with me and the other neighbor I’m friends with before. My family knows who all of them are and they know who all of us are. 

2 days ago, Jason comes home from his friends house around 11 pm. He is cursing and flinging stuff around in the kitchen, managing to wake up my husband and I. We went down to see what was going on, pretty upset due to the noise. He then handed us a ticket, and said “Mr. Lastname pulled me over and gave me a speeding ticket.” We both were angry at him, until we saw he was going 32 in a 25. My husband and I looked at eachother and immediately started ranting about how that’s absolute bullshit. He knows exactly who our son is, and he was going 7 over. We have other friends in law enforcement who say there’s sort of an unwritten rule that says 12 over is when you stop someone. 

I told SD I don’t want her to babysit for them until I talk to them. The next day i went outside as she was taking their dog for a walk, and asked her what was up with her husband giving Jason a ticket. She claimed she had no knowledge of it. I explained the situation and she apologized profusely and admitted that was an AH thing for husband to do. I could tell she was very embarrassed and now I feel a little bad. She said she would even talk to him about dropping it. Was I wrong to confront her about this?",2020-10-14 19:10:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jb79xv/aita_for_confronting_my_neighbor_about_her/,900,2081,0.89,2
298,YTA,AITA for going with someone else on a vacation I was supposed to take with my girlfriend,"Last summer (2019) my girlfriend [22F] and I [21F] were supposed to go to on vacation to Hawaii for about two weeks. We'd already bought plane tickets and booked the hotel in advance etc. 

Then her mother died and she had to go home (from Maine to North Carolina) for the funeral. I don't know her family so I figured it would be weird and pointless for me to go with her. 

Girlfriend said she still wanted to come back in time go on the trip but I knew she'd be depressed and down the whole time so it wouldn't be any fun anyways. So I told her to just forget about it, and I'd cancel the trip. 

But instead I asked my sister [21F] if she wanted to go since I already had the two tickets booked and the hotel booked and didn't actually want to waste the money. She said yes, so we went. I told her not to tell my girlfriend or anyone else, and not to post any pictures on social media or anything. No one else knew we were even going, so that was fine. As far as my GF knew I cancelled the trip, and by the time we got back from Hawaii she was still with her family in NC. Since GF thought the trip was cancelled she stayed there even longer than she would have, otherwise. She finally returned home about a week later, and never figured out I'd left at all, and I figured 'what she doesn't know can't hurt her.' 

Well anyways last week my sister finally slipped up and mentioned 'our trip to Hawaii last year,' and my girlfriend figured it out pretty quick was furious that I went on the trip without her while she was at a funeral.

I told her I didn't even see how it mattered because I wasn't going with her to the funeral anyways, so there was literally no difference on her end between me sitting at home while she was at the funeral and me going to Hawaii. She said that wasn't the point and the point was that I lied to her so I didn't have to take her with me, which is technically true, but only because I knew it would have just ruined the trip anyways since she would have been depressed the whole time. She also said it was 'weird' that I took family on what was supposed to be a 'romantic' trip (people seriously think siblings doing *anything* together is weird these days -- Game of Thrones has broken everyone's brains I swear). I told her it's literally been over a year and it's not that big a deal.

When the kids came into our home they originally called my husband and I by our first names but after we officially adopted them, A and B started calling us mom and Dad along with our biological kids. J still calls me by my first name but calls my husband dad. It does kind of hurt my feelings that J still calls me by my first name but it is understandable because she remembers her biological mom much better than A and B do. The other day, my husband was on the phone with his sister when she overheard J calling me by my first name. She later texts me and asks why I let J ‘disrespect’ me by calling me by my first name. I told her that I didn’t find it disrespectful at all and that was just how it was for us. She told me that I need to make J call me mom because it’s disrespectful otherwise.

300,YTA,AITA for telling my girlfriend(25F) that I(27M) would want a paternity test if I ever got her pregnant?,"I’ve dated Brit for 4 years and things are getting incredibly serious. We’re at a point where we are talking about marriage. A while ago we were talking about kids. The good news is that me and her both want kids one day. I decided when I was a teenager that no matter what if I got a woman pregnant I would get a paternity test before I signed anything saying I was the father. I told my girlfriend this and she was absolutely pissed. My girlfriend accused me of not trusting her and I assured her that wasn’t the issue. 

That being said I think I might have some issues revolving this. I am not my fathers biological child. I am the child of my mom and a boyfriend she was with for a year. My mom eventually broke it off with him. She was unknowingly pregnant and when she found out she it had been nearly a month since she had seen him so she assumed I was my dads. I came out half black and my mom confessed. I didn’t even know this story because my parents lied about my mom having black grandparents it until I was like 13 and I put two and two together. 

Brit knows that I’m a product of infidelity and knows I have some trauma from it, so I thought she’d be understanding but know she was not. She said that if I didn’t trust her to not be a wh*re that maybe we need to rethink our relationship. I told Brit that it wasn’t about me distrusting her, that I thought it be a good idea for anyone. I said that everyone that gets cheated on trusts their partner, and that people that think their partners are going to cheat on them end the relationships. She argued that if I wanted a pregnancy test, that literally means I have doubts that the baby is mine. I said that as a man I really don’t have much of a way to know if a baby that she gives birth to is mine or not, and that it doesn’t hurt to just see it written out.

She said she didn’t want to talk about it for a while, and said she needed to think about our relationship since we’re “lacking trust of one another”. She’s still pretty sore at me for this. I spoke to my older sister about this and she called me and d!ck for saying what I did.

301,YTA,AITA for Getting Upset that my Husband Peed in the Litter Box,"Backstory:

Husband and I have been married 11 years. We recently went through a relationship transition where we are no longer intimate or romantic. We raise kids together; he is what I consider a ""nest partner.""

The reason this happened is because he has had a lot of trouble owning his personal self over these last 11 years. When I met him, he was very teenage-like (at 30) but none of that has really changed over the years (now 43.) It has been years of emotional immaturity, lying, and avoiding conflict and I am finished with it. But we remain partners for the kids and the necessity of nostalgia and economy.

Anyhow, so one thing he has struggled with is his drinking. There have been times where he has managed it but most of the time, it's a disaster. It's especially bad when he's bored or stressed out. Right now he is on leave from the Navy because he has to use all his leave days before next fiscal year. So he's bored.

So, I bought a few beers for him and my boyfriend last night (my boyfriend lives with us.) I also bought myself a 2L of my favourite cider to have later this week. Well, at 3am, my boyfriend (who likes to snack at night) tells me that the beer fridge has completely been emptied of all swill, including my cider. I'm annoyed but whatever, nothing new when my husband's drinking (he just consumes everything.)

So (getting to the AITA part,) I go to get a cat litter scoop from my husband's room and it's a disaster this morning. We have 2 old cats (the 16 year old cat is my baby and he has IBD, diabetes, and renal failure) so we have to have CLEAN litter boxes all over the place, including our rooms upstairs. I glance down at the litter box in his room and it's FULL. Like, it's full like someone poured a whole jug of water in it full. His room had been closed all night and I'm pretty sure his little 19 year old void cat didn't make that much piss.

So I asked him outright, ""Did you piss in the cat litter box???""

He tried to deny it at first but then had to fess up because there was no way he was going to explain it. And I flipped out!!! Like, seriously, I'm managing the entire house, kids, boyfriend, old sick cats, bills, meals...and my 43 year old husband can't take his drunk ass downstairs to take a piss?????? Am I the asshole here? And he acts like it's not a big deal, like I should just get over it and let it go. He hasn't given me any hope in the last 11 years that his behaviour is getting any safer or better (he's driven drunk recently, which he has never done and he's hurt himself a few times falling and stumbling.)

I'm just tired of the antics.",2020-11-26 18:30:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k1km1d/aita_for_getting_upset_that_my_husband_peed_in/,139,238,0.88,0

She knows that finding a job can be difficult for me due to a felony I received when I was young and full of mistakes. 
She told me she wouldn’t be able to make enough money because she’s in college full time at the moment. I told her to take a break for the time being so she could support us through this tough time. She told me absolutely no that her degree is what’s most important. She told me if I wasn’t able to cover the rent she would just move back to her parents. (She’s not on the lease)

303,YTA,AITA for telling my mother that I had it worse when our father (her husband) died?,"At thirteen (now 26), I lost my dad. His death was especially hard on me. I was the only kid still in the house, my siblings are older. My father’s death destroyed my mother. For months she neglected me. She made little effort to tend to me, and she spent most of her time crying alone in her room or with her sisters (who cared for me since my mother would not). I understand that she lost her spouse, but she was still a parent, and I feel that she failed to parent me in that time.

Since then, our relationship has not been great. She knows I hold her behavior against her and considers me selfish for it. I think the same of her. My siblings are sympathetic to both of us, but each leans toward agreeing with me or my mom. I have done therapy, and it was moderately helpful. Before, I wasn’t able to understand her perspective at all. Now, I see how this was difficult for her, but I still feel that she failed me. However, it did help, and things were mostly friendly between us up until a few weeks ago. 

These issues resurfaced recently because I am  pregnant. I was over at my mom’s talking to her and my sister and I asked my sister if, when she was pregnant, she thought about our dad and was she afraid of her children having to lose her early and go through what we went through. I started to talk about all the important life events my dad missed out on, and about how painful that time period was for me. At this point, my mother chimed in, saying that it was the hardest time in her life, and that watching us struggle made it even harder.

I thought it was incredibly rude of her to make a comment like that, knowing that she did nothing to make my dad’s death easier for me. So I said something like, “Well you sure didn’t show it.” She asked what I meant, and I told her that she completely neglected me, and that I Felt like I lost both parents. My mom started to cry and said that my dad’s death almost broke her. She said that she could barely take care of herself, and that she did her best to make sure that other people were supporting me. I told her that her grief over losing her husband, who she had 25 years with, couldn’t compare to me losing my dad so early. She actually got really mad and asked me to leave.

That was three weeks ago, and I haven’t heard from her since, but I’ve reached out. My siblings are torn, but my husband thinks that my mom is right and that I should apologize. He says that if I lost him, I may have a hard time functioning normally too. I say that he hasn’t lost a parent, especially so young, and he has no idea what it feels like to be ignored by your only living parent. Even if I was too harsh, I think that she is using this as another opportunity to act like a child instead of a parent. I’d like to know what other people who are removed from the situation think, since I am getting mixed feedback from my family. AITA?

ETA: first I want to thank everyone for replying. This has been a useful exercise and I can definitely acknowledge that I have to continue therapy. I want to be clear about a couple of things though so that my anger makes more sense, because I think that a lot of people are blowing it out of proportion (seriously suggesting that I can’t be a parent...?). When I said that my aunts took care of me, they handled me on a basic level. I ate and went to school. I have always had an allowance so it’s not as if I was in danger of starving or anything like that. However, I was thirteen years old and had never lost a loved one. I hadn’t even had a period yet and one of my worst memories is of when I got it and started crying and my mom came into my room for the first time since his passing to tell me to be quiet because I was being insensitive. My mother was checked out most of the time and would only engage if it was relevant to her own grief. Imagine having two parents one day, and no one the next. I was heartbroken and thought it was my fault at first. My aunts did not provide me emotional support; that was mostly my sibling closest in age who took a semester away from college so that I wouldn’t be literally by myself all day every day. For what it’s worth, of my four siblings, he is one of the two who sides strongly with my mom.

You will continue calling me the asshole and I will continue to consider it. I just don’t want people thinking that I made a comment like that because my mom was just “sad.”

ETA again: thank you all again for commenting. I can see that I was 100% the asshole to compare, and I am looking into sorting through my anger and pain. Hopefully with an apology from me, I will be able to open up the conversation with my mom again with a bit more willingness to truly empathize with her, because I understand now that I haven’t actually moved on.",2020-10-31 16:57:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jlltvt/aita_for_telling_my_mother_that_i_had_it_worse/,447,1076,0.93,1

My sister has a lot of great qualities, don't get me wrong, but c'mon. 50 year old millionaires don't date film student baristas who are less than half their age. It's not a sugar baby situation, I've seen Mary push back on expensive gifts \*and\* she's talked to me about Susan being 'too eager' to pamper her. So it's not a sugar baby thing, and it's probably not just trophy/arm candy. 

But I just...there's no reason for a woman like Susan to want to date a girl so young who legitimately owns more Harley Quinn themed t-shirts than she does real shirts. Nobody in their 50s dates someone in their 20s unless they're a predator/abusive or there's money and status being exchanged. Since to the best of my knowledge it's not the latter, I feel safe in assuming it's the former, and I (as gently as I could) told Mary that. She, perhaps unsurprisingly, did not take it well. But neither did our parents, which *did* surprise me. Neither of them are doing well health wise, so I think they're just relieved Mary's got a stable and well off partner and don't care about the long term, but I'm getting frustrated with all the crap I'm getting, so I bring this to you Reddit.

309,YTA,AITA for wanting an apology for my friend's daughter's behavior?,"So this happened right before Covid  and my friend still hasn't talked to me since. 

So I (26f) had acquired a free hotel stay at a hotel with a swim park.  I invited my friend (27f) and her kids (5f and 10f) to come and stay there with me for the night so we all could swim at the swim park together.  Might I add that I invited them even though her kids can be bratty. I was just wanting to be nice. 

So, after we were done swimming we go back to the hotel room to shower and get changed into pajamas and order pizza. As my friend was helping the 5 y/o get dressed, the 5 y/o was dramatically acting pouty and just blurted out ""I don't like Nicole!"" In a bratty voice. (Let's call myself Nicole). 

I was immediately insulted because I invited them to stay with me there for free so we could all have fun, and  *this* is the thanks I get?? 

My friend asked her why, and the 5 year old said ""Because Nicole kept splashing me when I didn't want her to do it"" 

Then, THEN the 10 year old turns on me too (surprise surprise🙄) and takes the 5 year old's side. And said that I kept splashing her even though she was crying. (She's a dramatic brat, so it was most likely 99% crocodile tears) besides, IT'S A POOL! People get splashed. If you don't like getting splashed, then don't go swimming! 

I felt like I wasted my free pass on these two ungrateful kids (I'm not surprised to tell you the truth) 

My friend didn't tell her to apologize to me and just continued to get the 5 year old dressed and acted like she didn't hear the 5 year old insult me. 

I spoke up for my self and reminded them that If it wasn't for me they wouldn't be swimming and staying in a nice hotel and that they are being ungrateful and owed me an apology. My friend said and I quote ""She's 5, and frankly has a valid reason to not like you at the moment"" 

I told her my sentiments about it's expected to get splashed in a pool, and it was just harmless fun. My friend stuck to her guns and still wouldn't make her daughter apologize to me. 

We argued for half an hour with her telling me to just drop it, but why should I?? I don't appreciate being treated like trash after I do a nice thing for them. 

I then told her that I was going to drive home (leaving them there to figure out how to get home (no uber in that town)since I drove them there with MY car and MY gas money) because I was just done being used and treated like trash. If it were up to me, I wouldn't have shared my pizza with them either,  but to be fair, my friend paid for half of it. 

We ended up just going to bed. When we got up the next day, we were barely speaking and I drove them home. We haven't spoken since. So, am I the asshole in all this?? Or is she for not making her kid apologize?",2020-11-08 23:07:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jqlroa/aita_for_wanting_an_apology_for_my_friends/,320,571,0.84,0
310,YTA,AITA because of the activities I gave for my kids to do?,"My wife went out to go see her mom so I was in charge of watching the kids, we have a 8 year old son and a daughter who is 11. Mom is gone so i have to come up with activities for them to do. Son(S) is well, my son. We all know boys are into physical activities more and get rowdy if they stay in place too long. My daughter(D) is older and knows how to entertain herself a bit better. So I give my daughter some crayons and paper while I take my S out to the back and show him how to box on the heavy bag. I think everything is good at this point. Well my wife eventually comes home. She goes inside while I’m still out back with my son. Wife calls us in and after about 30 minutes of settling down she asks to speak to me in private.

“Why was D stuck inside while you and S were out back having fun?” I’m like “What? I gave her crayons and paper.” She tells me she came in and saw that D wasn’t really enthusiastic about drawing. Was absent mindlessly scribbling while she kept looking through the window at me and S. I ask her how I was supposed to know that she was bored. D is a little girl, boxing ain’t exactly their idea of a good time, I thought pretty stuff like drawing or coloring was. My wife is like”Wow that’s really sexist. I would have loved if my dad showed me how to box.” I kinda just throw my hands up in frustration. I’m not a damn mind reader. I go leave the room and head to the kitchen to go cook. Wife yells out at me”And boxing is probably more important for her so she can defend herself from creeps!” I don’t reply to her. 

We eat diner and I can tell my wife is still mad at me. She tries to make a point by asking D”Did you have fun inside while your dad and brother were outside, sweetie?” D gives like a bored shrug and my wife turns her head to me in a sharp, sassy way while she gives me a stare.

311,YTA,AITA for being mad at my(26f) boyfriend(28f) for paying off his sister’s student loans,"I’ve been dating my boyfriend for 2.5 years now. Recently his little sister graduated from college and got a great job. As a gift he decided to pay off all her student loans - around like 65k. His little sister already had a lot of help from his parents and is going into a lucrative career field, she could’ve paid it off easily within a year or two and still had a decent chunk of money left over.

My boyfriend knows I’ve been struggling with student loans for the last couple of years. I graduated with 95k in student loans and I make about 50k a year but between rent, my car, etc.. I still have so much left to pay. I’ve held off on getting a masters because of this debt. My boyfriend makes almost three times as much as me but we’ve always split bills 50/50. I was fine with that but hearing that he paid all this money for his sister while knowing that I’ve been struggling because of my student loans is like a slap in the face, we’ve been together for almost 3 years now. We got in a huge fight over it and he said his sisters been in his life for more than 20 years and they’re really close, plus he’s free to do whatever he wants his money. I ended up leaving our apartment to go stay with my parents for a bit. His sister found out through one of my friends the reason why I left and she’s told her entire family about it. His family has blocked me from social media and I wasn’t invited to their Thanksgiving this year. AITA?

Edit: When my boyfriend and I moved in together a year ago he knew what I was paying in rent when I lived with a roomate and suggested we look for places twice that so that we could split rent and everything equally. It kind of sucks that we could get a much nicer place like some of his work friends if we were to split equitably, but 50/50 split was one thing he was unwilling to budge on.

312,YTA,AITA for having a safe and not telling my SO what's in it?,"SO and I have been together just over 5 years. about 18 months ago I bought a safe; it's quite large, about 40cm x 40cm x 40cm.

We don't live together, she spends about half the week at mine every week because I have my own place.

When I first bought the safe I hadn't decided exactly where I was gonna house it. She asked if I was planning to bolt it to the floor or wall and when I told her I had no plans to do that, she became upset because she figured the safe was obviously not to protect my stuff from being stolen in the event of a burglary but rather to keep the contents away from her. it caused an argument.

during that argument I made it clear that my view is we both have a right to privacy. just because we're in a relationship doesn't mean we own each other and have to share every single thing with the other; I'm allowed to have things that are private, for my eyes only.

she disagrees and feels that it's unacceptable. she says that there could be alcohol and/or condoms in there for all she knows, which could be ""evidence of cheating."" for the record there has been no history of cheating whatsoever in our relationship, and I have a drinks cupboard in plain view in the kitchen

she has said that when we live together, me having a private safe that she doesn't know what's in it will not be acceptable. I feel that if I want one then that's my prerogative. AITA?

313,YTA,AITA for trolling my roommate's girlfriend in a video game after she ruined my own game experience?,"My roommate started dating his girlfriend about 6 months ago. I guess I didn't really care either way about her at first, but the more she was around the more my disdain grew.

She's very fake cutesy and loud, frankly I find her outright repellent. I don't get exactly why they're together and I've outright told him that I don't like her and that I find her annoying. His only response has been I just have to deal with her being around. But I live here too and that just doesn't seem fair. 

The worst thing about this situation is that she's started playing our video games just cause she saw that my roommate and I play them. She made a League account where she mostly goofs off in TFT but duos with my roommate in blinds sometimes, he's trying to teach her how to play Guilty Gear and Mortal Kombat, and he has her over almost nightly to watch her slowly run through Dragon Quest XI. She's pretty awful at all these games and I kind of hate how she acts when playing, again very ditzy and obnoxious.

Since she started she's been asking I wanted to play with them ever I always reject cause I just don't want to be around them when they're together. Last night, they were playing League and I could hear her *screeching* through a call and ramble about things she just didn't understand about the game. I keep walking in while my roommate was playing, and I guess he thought I was signaling something because he asked if I wanted to join them. For the the first time I agreed because I hadn't played with him in a while so I was kind of missing it.

We started playing and I was trying to enjoy the game with my roommate, but her lingering presence kept my mood down. Whenever I tried to correct her on things or teach her about the game she seemed to be half listening or just forgets a couple minutes later. Most the time the two of them talked with each other, which made me wonder why I was even here in the first place. 

Eventually, by like game 5 I was completely frustrated. I picked Anivia (for those who don't get it, she's a character who can make walls that even your teammates can't walk through) and spent the game blocking her off from teamfights, leaving her behind walls, and overall just trying to get her to die as much as possible. This finally got her attention and she started getting sad and pretty distressed. My roommate was also tilting and tried to get me to stop. In the moment I didn't really care, I just wanted her to have as little fun as I was having. We ended up surrendering at the 20 minute mark and she was done for the night.

He came in my room to yell at me about the whole thing. I told him it was just a game anyways and she shouldn't be so sensitive about trolling in multiplayer games if she plans on playing them. He didn't want to hear my side of things and just went to bed.

I get that I frustrated them but it was only because she was annoying me first. I saw the whole thing as making her feel the same way I was feeling when I'm forced to be around her.",2020-11-21 12:30:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jy9ynh/aita_for_trolling_my_roommates_girlfriend_in_a/,169,283,0.82,0
314,YTA,"AITA for ""forcing"" my son to shave his head?","My son (19) has always had short hair. I have always made sure that he gets his hair cut to an acceptable length and he has never had any complaints about it before. I don't see anything wrong with this as I am the same with his other siblings as well, I just want them to look smart and presentable.

However, lately he has been going through a goth phase. He's always wanted dark clothes, ""guyliner"", jewellery and absurd hairstyles. But now that he's older now and has his own money, he has started getting a bit more rebellious and has started dressing the complete opposite of the way he normally dresses. I have given in a lot when it came to the clothes, allowing black ripped jeans and horror t shirts, but I always drew the line at really long sweaters and certain things that look more like they are made for women. He has always had anxiety and self confidence issues so I just want to avoid any bullying about him looking like a girl. This then continued to his hair as well and he started growing it out.

As many people know, when going from a really short hairstyle to something long, there is a point in time where it starts to look really messy. A few of my friends mentioned how messy his hair looked but I assured them that it was just a phase and that he'd be back to his usual self in no time. But he didn't go back. The hair got longer and messier, I even heard a few of his weird friends saying he looked ""adorable"" with the messy hair.

Eventually I lost my patience and told him he either fixed his hair or started tying it up. He complained that it would look stupid tied back as it isn't long enough yet. But I was persistent about it. We had no barbers as this was during lock down but I was more than happy to cut his hair myself.

A few months ago, he came to me and asked me to shave his hair off, like I'd done with his brother (his brother was really happy with how his hair turned out). I complied. Immediately afterwards, my son started wearing a beanie. All the time. Even in the house. He refuses to take it off.

Last  night we had an argument and he brought up how disgusting and ugly he felt with short hair and how I'd taken away the one thing he actually liked about himself. I don't understand this, I think all my children are beautiful. He also brought up how his friend's parents let them express themselves and didn't judge them for their appearance. I tried to argue that I was just looking out for him, he'd been so happy since starting college and I didn't want that to be ruined by bullies. He has a very feminine face and long hair will just cause confusion and get him picked on. He left and hasn't spoken to me all day today. I think he's overreacting, especially considering it was him that came to me and asked me to shave his head, but my husband thinks I've been a little harsh.

AITA?

Edit 1

I'm getting a lot of responses from people saying that I am being overprotective. I think I have every right to be. When he was 18, not long after  I started to allow him to stay out at night as long as he told me who he was with, where he was, when he'd be back and what he was doing. He started to abuse this privilege and started sleeping around with several men, age of consent here is 16. He knew them beforehand and used protection but I was still furious. Word somehow got out and the neighbours opinions of him changed from him just being a weird quiet boy to a whore.

I think he did it to spite me and when I confronted him about it, he snapped at me that at least they made him feel loved and he actually felt good about himself when he was with them.

This has been the only other incident where my son has had the nerve to yell at me after disobeying me. I felt terrible that he thought I didn't love him so I have started reminding him that I love him everyday. I feel like I am justified to be protective of him as I don't want this to happen ever again.

I think I am as good a mother as I can be.

Edit 2

Okay I get it. ""I'm a terrible mother"" and don't deserve my son. He's an ""angel"" that can't do anything wrong.

Well I tried to apologise last night and he didn't accept it and when I get frustrated he walked away. I went to check on him later on and he'd cried himself to sleep. So thanks for the advice, it really helped.

Real last edit

I admit that IATA. My son had a full on panic attack because of me. I know I was extremely defensive in my comments and my post but I want to take the time to apologise. I'm sorry, you guys were 100% right. I am a terrible mother, I am going to end up losing my child and I need to step up.

He doesn't want to speak to me right now so I'm giving him time to himself something needs to be done. My husband was very blunt with me that I am not as good of a mother as I liked to think.

We are an Armenian family in France, and our membership in the Armenian Orthodox church is very important to our faith and to our family's social standing in the community.

Lately, my daughter has been reading atheist blogs and has been arguing with us about religion. I remind her that our religion is an important aspect of who we are and we expect her to attend church weekly as long as she is living with us.

This morning, she announced that she is done going to church since she wants to officially declare herself as secular. I reminded her once again that church attendance is a condition on her living with us as her not going would be a shame for the family within the Armenia community. I also reminded her that while our homeland is being attacked, the least she can do is pray.

She called me ridiculous and said that she can't wait to move out. I told her okay, so she has 12 days to pack up her things and find another living arrangement. She cried hysterically about how this was abusive during a pandemic. I said this is tough love and that is what it is like to live without a strong community (which will happens if she leaves the church).

316,YTA,AITA for being angry my sister treats me like her child?,"My mom died when I was about 2, after that my sister became the mom of our household. She was only about 13 at the time but she took on all the household duties. My dad had to work double and was depressed after my mom died so we barely saw him.

She did the cooking and cleaning, with a bit of help from my older brother who was 11 at the time, when I started school she tutored me, didn't do extracurricular activities so she could be at my games and come home early. Even though she wanted to go to an out of province university she enrolled in one closer so she could take care of me. I'm grateful really but I feel kind of disappointed with our current relationship. See my sister really was a mom to me, she'd lecture me, punish me and annoy the heck out of me until I'd do my homework.

Even though she's married and has a kid now, she still acts like MY mom. She'll call me every few days to check up on me, she always wants to know my grades and she'll pop in with some food. She treats my older rother extremely differently though! When the three of go hiking together, she's making fun of my brother the whole time. She cheers me on, gives me an excess amount of water, makes us take multiple breaks so I can ""Rest for a moment"". I also want to have that sister-brother bond with her, I don't want her to be motherly anymore.

So I addressed my concerns with her about, she looked sad but said she'd try. For two weeks she was ok, a few mess up here and there but we were making progress but after that it just went back to the way it used to be. She thinks I haven't ate? Brings over some food. Asks me about me financial situation and my school life excessively and lectures me about how my house isn't clean enough(to her credit she was right it wasn't). Anyways after two weeks passed over her motherly shenanigans I snapped on a phone call and told her that I didn't not like our relationship at all.

She cried and I hung up. She's been texting me but I've been ignoring her, I just don't feel calm enough to deal with this. Half of me thinks she's trying her best and the other thinks she isn't. I love my sister and I don't want to snap at her, but when I was venting to my brother and some of my friends they told me I was the asshole. While others told me she was the asshole.

For context I'm 21 and she's 32.

But my boyfriend also calls Luna names like ""sweetie"" and ""cutie."" For example when he gets home Luna will usually go greet him at the door and he'll kneel down and pick her up and hug her and say something like ""sweetie I missed you too."" He's 100% talking to his cat not to me when he says that he missed her.

I told him that I don't really like it that he calls his cat the same names he calls me. It's not right because his cat's name is Luna and it's probably confusing to her hearing him call her ""sweetie"" and also hearing him call me ""sweetie"" as well.

318,YTA,AITA for forgetting my wife's birthday after six years of marriage?," Now, hear me out here. I promise there's some substance to my side of the story.

My wife (34f) and I (36m) have been married for six years with two sons (5 and 3). We are both members of the congregation of a comparatively progressive church and attended mass whenever we got the chance before the pandemic.

Flashback to April of this year. As per most Sunday mornings, my wife, kids, and I were attending weekly mass, though it was virtual now. Our priest, who we'll call Father Joseph, announced that our church would be hosting a Zoom event on Easter Sunday. After the service, him and I were messaging about the event. He seemed rather excited about the event, and since he always loved when I brought my sons to services I told him I would attend.

Now of course, as an avid Christian man and lover of holiday spirit, I decided that I would go all out for my sons and decorate the house so that this year's Easter as well as the event would still feel special for them despite what we were going through with it having been still around the beginning of the pandemic.

For the next few weeks leading up to Easter Sunday, my wife would sometimes ask me about what we were planning to do that day. I kept telling her not to worry, and that I had something planned. I wanted my big Easter plans to surprise her too, and she deserved a break. She didn't need to have the stress of planning a holiday for our sons on her shoulders too.

Skip to the morning of Easter Sunday. I was awake much earlier than the rest of the family, having been setting up my decorations and getting ready for the Zoom event. My wife came into the living room to see all of the pastel decorations and balloons, as well as the breakfast I had made especially for the kids. I stopped her when she went to eat the kid's breakfast, and she asked me why she couldn't eat it. I told her that I wanted everything to look perfect for the kids when they woke up, and that I had saved some extra pancakes for us.

Apparently that was the wrong answer.

My wife's birthday fell on the same day as Easter Sunday that year, and I got too caught up in trying to do something nice for the kids to pay attention to the date. Because of the pandemic, we have been spending much more time together now than ever before, and I am afraid that this mistake is causing a rift in our marriage. I really need to get an outside opinion on this, but I am not comfortable talking to anyone I know about this.",2020-11-05 03:09:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/job59k/aita_for_forgetting_my_wifes_birthday_after_six/,387,505,0.87,0

She was really nasty about it and turned her kid against the husband. She ended up getting 8 k a month in child support. Yes 8 k a month like a average living wage for doing nothing. I thought she was going to use it for the child and to care for him and put half of the money into a index fund for him so he’s got 1.3 million by the time is 18 at a 8 percent return. But no she spent it on herself because she was too lazy to get a job. So I told her it’s  supposed to be used for the child and not her lazy ass. I than said she’s a horrible mother and no wonder her husband divorced her. She than cried and left. My wife said I was harsh but that’s unfair to the guy who works his ass off to just have  a fifth of his salary gone. So AITA.

320,YTA,AITA for kicking a gatekeeper out of our spirituality group?,"Throwaway. I (32F) run a spirituality and witchcraft based group on Facebook and we've previously had meetups before Covid. It's a fun and educational space that many benefit from and we do our best to give info to those who can't access it themselves. 

We had a member (19F, joined at 18) who's been with us for a year. She started out as a fun member and was getting along great with everyone. All was well! 

That is, until we mentioned last week how we're going to be making and selling dreamcatchers as a way to raise money for a group event. She suddenly was quiet and messaged me personally (as I am admin) with concerns of """"""appropriation"""""". She said she was native American, and that her people make them and that they're sacred to her and she feels they shouldn't be made by us (since we're white people I bet 🙄). I had no prior knowledge of her apparent native American heritage. It seemed to come out of the blue. She's very light skinned and has short hair-something I've heard native Americans don't have as it's frowned upon in their culture to cut hair. She also doesn't talk or act any differently despite her apparent heritage. 

She told me that she lived on a reservation most of her life and only recently moved away. I didn't know of it, any of it. Quite frankly, it doesn't seem genuine to me. 

I told her it wasn't right to gatekeep the spiritually and practices of ""her people"" just because they MIGHT have originated with them, and that these things call to people from all walks of life. 

She argued with me, and ended up making a post asking for support and calling me racist because I told her I didn't believe she was actually Indian and didn't support her rude behaviour. 

My group ripped her apart 😂 Excepting a few other ""native Americans"" (only one I actually know is genuinely Indian) who said I was in the wrong. I didn't want politics or gatekeeping in my group. We are a space for positivity and kindness, not limiting and racially segregating. That's the true racism. I am an advocate for humans to be one race and to care for one another regardless of skin tone. 

I banned her and her defenders from my group, and made a firm rule against what she was advocating for. We will be non divisive. 

Well, she messaged me and sent me paragraphs on paragraphs explaining to me (in a way I felt patronizing, she assumed I knew nothing) her perspective and trying to ""educate"" me. I blocked her. 

I'm now receiving people attempting to join my group and deface my name as well as harass my group members and make my sanctuary into a chaotic place of negativity for no real reason. That leads me to believe that she posted screenshots somewhere. 

So tell me, am I REALLY the asshole? I think I might be the asshole because so many are now against me and making me feel awful for something that shouldn't have been an issue to begin with.

321,YTA,AITA for locking my daughter out of her room.,"Throwaway because I don’t want this tied to my main

I have 3 daughters. Oldest (Ava, 18) middle (Emma, 16) and youngest (Lily, 12).  Ava and Lily are both very talkative and social. Emma used to be like that when she was little. We used to call her CNN because she’d tell everyone everything. If she heard me say I gained 5 pounds she’d tell grandma. If we bought someone a gift she’d tell them the price, where, and when we got it. She told us to stop calling her that but we felt it wasn’t a big deal. 

Eventually she stopped talking so much and started staying in her room all day. She leaves for school then goes straight to her room when she gets home and won’t come out until dinner. I want her to be more outgoing and talkative like her sisters and her sisters, my husband, and I started telling her she needs to get out of her room. It was to the point where she’d sleep at her grandparents house and none of us would notice. 

Over quarantine she never left her room except for food, water, and to get to the bathroom. We asked her why she never comes out to hang out with us and she said her sisters are loud and obnoxious and she doesn’t like to be around them. We felt that was very rude and grounded her. Her sisters are loud and like to do things like loudly sing or yell songs and play rap music (which Emma hates but she sings musical songs in her room so we feel it’s about even) but they’re not doing anything to her. 

Emma went to sleep at her grandparents house on Wednesday and while she was gone I locked the door to her room (I have the only key. When Emma came back and couldn’t get into her room I told her she was going to hang out with us. She was furious. She called her grandparents to pick her up and hasn’t spoken to me since. 

AITA for trying to get my daughter to spend time with us.

Edit: I realized the timeline wasn’t too clear. Everyone’s saying she’s quiet because she’s a teenager but she’s been quiet and reserved since she was probably 8. 

And she’s allowed to go to her grandparents house whenever she wants. She still talks to them but refuses to talk to us. She’s been staying at their house since Wednesday.

And people are saying to learn about her interests. She loves musical theater. We all think it’s annoying and hate the songs and refuse to watch the videos and don’t talk about it.

Update: Emma’s grandpa came today to get the rest of Emma’s clothes and her medicines. He told us she’s trying to get emancipated and they’ve uninvited us from thanksgiving. I hope y’all are happy now.",2020-11-21 23:54:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jylefd/aita_for_locking_my_daughter_out_of_her_room/,215,151,0.71,1

Now they told me that they are giving me the entire inheritance.,"My grandparents are pretty successful my grandpa was a cardiologist and my grandma was an entrepreneur. My grandparents had three kids in total. I am not all that close with my cousins now, we used to be as kids but after high school we really haven't hung out much. I would also say that of the grandkids I am the closest one to my grandparents. 

Long story short, my cousins made a lot of Tik Toks a lot of them bashing old people in particular old White people, that they can't wait for them to die so the country can make some actual progress. I showed it to my grandparents. 

My grandparents saw the Tik Toks and they were really upset, they had a phone call with my cousins (I don't know what was said, grandparents don't want to talk about it and cousins not close with) but my grandparents told me that if that's how they want to behave then they aren't getting a sent. My grandparents told me and my dad that I'll be the only grandkid getting an inheritance, some money will be going towards charity and my grandfather's best friend's kid.

Now my cousins HATE ME, they think I am the reason why they aren't getting an inheritance. I don't know what to say like? If you hate someone than no they aren't going to want to give you money.

My son (14) drink ALOT of water. If we don't regulate it, he will drink 3,4, or 5 bottles of water a day. He just says he is really thirsty. 

The problem is tap water in our area is terrible so he can't drink that, but buying so many water bottles is inanely expensive. We spend hundreds of dollars a month on water.

We took him to the doctor a couple years ago to see if there was an issue, hes fine. He just drinks alot of water. 

Me and my husband are kinda tired of this, so last week we sat our son down and made a new rule. He can have 2 water bottles a day, which is still enough to not be thirsty. To enforce this rule, every bottle he drinks past the limit is one day of grounding.

We got some push back at first but it wasn't a problem until yesterday, where he drank 5 bottles of water in just 24 hours. We followed the rules and grounded him for 3 days. He was really mad and said its totally unfair, but we reminded him those were the rules.

326,YTA,WIBTA for blocking my parents from being involved in my wedding plans because they're not paying?,"I plan on having my wedding next spring. It's going to be a cultural wedding with people flying in from Nigeria; if you know anything about Nigerian (and other cultural) weddings, they're close to impossible to do on the cheap but we're going to do what we can to make it a positive and authentic experience without living beyond our means.

My fiancé's side is Nigerian and is willing to help out with some of the costs. It's super kind of them, not asked of them, and not expected of them. Nor is it ""traditional"" for the groom's side to help out, although in 2020 tradition is mostly irrelevant even if there are cultural dynamics in play. 

I never asked my parents for any financial contribution to the wedding, but I did reach out to my mom recently to confirm she's not paying a dime. We need to set a serious budget so costs don't balloon. When I got engaged she adopted this silly ""joking"" tone about how she had to clothe and feed my siblings and I for XX years so she's not going to pay a dime for our wedding. 

I chatted with her recently and it's the same tone - no contribution, it's apparently comical that I even brought it up, and she has no problem being transparent with my MIL that they're not helping. 

No problem! I'm not entitled to anything - just wanted to confirm that she's indeed serious and okay with the other side knowing that. 

I'm actively planning out stuff with my MIL and my mom has asked a few questions, like how things are going, what venue we're interested in, etc. I don't want to share in the planning with her. I plan on just ignoring her questions and respectfully telling her ""don't worry about it"" at any inquiry. There's nothing she needs to know because she's not involved in the process, and this is the same approach I would take with anyone else who does not have an active role (groom's side and groomsmen/bridesmaids/flower girl/etc.) and is just a guest. My parents also won't be involved in any special aspects of the event and will have no special roles/requirements so all they need to do is show up like everyone else.

327,YTA,AITA for suggesting my friend date girls if she isn't attracted to guys?,"I don't know why everyone is pissed at me for this.

My buddy Leah's been single for about three years now and is trying out Hinge.  I noticed that she tends to pass on the more ""masculine"" looking guys. Like, she'll message the more skinny, feminine looking dudes and skip over the bigger guys or dudes with beards or body hair.  Not to judge her, but guys are going to look like guys and she's going to be single for a long ass time if she keeps swiping on guys just because she doesn't want to date a lumberjack. 

Well, I set her up with my friend Alex recently.  They have a lot of things in common, even if he looks like a biker with a shaved head and beard combo.  Only their date didn't go so well.  Alex admitted he wasn't attracted to Leah, but Leah blew up on me and told me to never pull that kind of stunt on her again.

Me, getting pissed on Alex's behalf because he's my best friend and she blew him off on their date, told her, ""well if you're so hung up on femme guys, why don't you start dating women instead?""

I honestly don't know what I did wrong because now Leah, Alex, and a bunch of our other friends are pissed at me.  Some of them say that who Leah is attracted to is no one's business but her own and others because they think I'm trying to force her to be a lesbian.  Meanwhile, I think Leah needs to get over her hangup over big guys with beards because we live in fucking Portland, Oregon and it's lumberjack/hipster/bear type central up here.

She divorced my father when I was a teenager, but I chose to stay mostly with her because dad was not too good to us. I am now 23, living alone and I visit her every time I get the chance. She's always been a good friend to me, but there's something that has always bothered me about her. You see... I am a Christian man and she's always been into rock music, she dresses almost always in black, in men's clothes, she wears chains, necklaces, bracelets, skulls, you name it.  In her spare time, she likes to paint disturbing pictures with blood and gore and lots of profanity, which she kept from me until a few years ago. She has several trinkets around the house too, I recently learned that one of them is a statue of Baphomet. I've always tried to guide her in the right direction, to help her see the light, to read about God, but she ignores me every time. It's like trying to talk to a teenager that is stuck in the goth phase and I don't know how to approach her anymore. 

Forward to two days ago, I visited her like usual and confronted her about the statue and her ""preferences"". She just told me that that's just how she likes to express herself and, about the statue, that she's a satanist. I was baffled and hurt and she noticed it, so she explained me what it was all about, that she's an atheist and got ""unbaptized"", then turned to satanism to be ""her own god"". Each explanation was worse than the other. That day I also leanred that I am not baptized, I asked her why and she told me that she wanted me to choose what to follow when I grew up instead of forcing any beliefs on me. While it makes sense, I felt betrayed. Most of my friends wre baptized when they were babies, so I felt like my own mom set me up to be a heretic or something. I told her that I am worried about her future and I feel unheard... but she got upset and told me to respect people's choices. I said that I only wanted her to be more normal and maybe dad left because he was also tired like me (he is a christian too).

When I told my wife about it, she actually got a bit mad with me. She's saying what I did was basically entrapment. I disagree, I gave them proper studying material that was entirely correct.

Not like completely in your face, women are less than men sexist but still a sexist. He believes in a lot of gender role bs and can occasionally make shitty sexist jokes that he says are”jUsT jOkEs!” Surprising because he is only 26 and grew up on a much more left area of the US. I knew he was like this but I thought he was just being immature and having bad taste in jokes and would out grow it. And because I loved him for everything else. Well we have twin 6 year old daughters and a 4 year old boy. And he Is still the same way. I decided that I would have to do something about this that would fix my husbands stupid views. So I told my husband that I will be giving him a bunch of material on feminism/sexism/gender roles and that I will be quizzing him on the material. If he doesn’t pass(and trust me, it isn’t difficult material. Only way for him to fail would be for him to not actually read the stuff) or refuses to partake I told them that”We will have serious problems.” 

We got through one test and he barely passed. Sigh. He asked me how many more of these we will do and I told him until I felt comfortable in his knowledge and saw an improvement in his words and actions. He threw a bit of a tantrum here “You got to be kidding me. You’re giving me quizzes over here like I’m a fucking child. I’m not sexist.” Well I tell him his actions say differently and remind him of the consequences. He huffs and puffs and  says this is all so stupid before getting up. I obviously didn’t like his reaction to this. It’s safe to say he didn’t get any that night or the following morning. I told him his next test would be in two days and he rolled his eyes.

Blair’s birth mother is still part of her life, but she was in bad place and she gave custody to my grandparents after giving birth. She’s in a better place now, and married with two other kids. Blair’s birth father is unknown to her, and says her step-father or his family never treated her like a member of their family, but I think she’s being dramatic! Blair certainly accepted the countless birthday and Christmas gifts from her birth mother and step-father over the years. 

In the obituary, Blair asked if she could be listed as her grandfather’s daughter because he was the only real father she knew. This pissed me off because I think Blair just wants attention and I find this disrespectful to my mother and my aunt. I was trying to discuss this with another cousin and accidentally sent a text message to Blair saying “Can you believe Blair wants to be listed as a daughter in Grandpa’s obituary?” 

Now I’m getting passive aggressive text messages from Blair and my grandmother about how I have no consideration for my cousin’s feelings. And now I’m afraid to even bring the issue up with anyone else since I’m apparently in the wrong. I don’t think I’m wrong to be upset over someone who’s clearly just seeking attention and doesn’t care how this might hurt her birth mother and step-father.

Sara recently asked me if she could move in with my boyfriend and I because our parents were being 'unreasonable'. I talked with my boyfriend, he agreed, and she moved in about two weeks ago. 

Things have been fine, although I have noticed that my boyfriend has started to avoid my sister at all costs. My sister said that this makes her feel bad, so I sat my boyfriend down and told him to stop because it was upsetting to my sister. But I noticed that he hasn't stopped. 

Today, I arrived home and my boyfriend and sister were arguing. I got between them and demanded to know what was wrong. My boyfriend started talking about how my sister had made 'unwanted advances' towards him and was 'peeping' in on him while he was changing. My sister was close to tears and denied the allegations. 

I could tell that my sister was upset, and she is NOT a liar, so I told my boyfriend that until I made up my mind on who to trust, then he was going to have to stay at a friend's house while I sorted out my feelings. He got angry and said that it was his apartment first, so I had no right to kick him out. 

I threatened to leave with my sister if he didn't, and that deemed to knock the sense into him. He packed a bag and left, probably to a friend's house, while I sat down with my sister, but she still denied anything. 

I called my boyfriend to tell him that I needed for him to stay away for a few days while I got everything sorted our and he just went off, yelling about how I had no right and that my sister was in the wrong until I just hung up because I didn't want to fight. 

But the longer we go without talking, the more I feel bad for kicking him out.

334,YTA,AITA for getting my boyfriend a gift card for clothes instead of the game he wanted?,"Gerald and I have been together for eight years now.  We met in college and are in our late twenties now.  

He's been a great boyfriend, albeit a bit immature for his age but it's something I've learned to deal with.  My biggest problem is how he dresses. 

I'm going to get so much shit for this, but I hate how my boyfriend dresses.  He still wears the same baggy anime t-shirts and sweatpants and baggy jeans from when we first met.  Everything he owns doesn't fit him properly and some of his shirts are starting to have holes in them.  This isn't an issue with him because he works from home and hasn't really left the house since March.

I honestly feel more self conscious being around him.  We had a Zoom meetup with some friends recently and I couldn't help but notice how put together everyone was.  None of the guys were wearing t-shirts.  Their hair neat and they looked like they were taking care of themselves.  Meanwhile, Gerald was wearing the same Nartuo shirt he's been wearing for the last week and had a five o'clock shadow and his hair was really shaggy and looked like he needed to run a comb through it.  Next to them, he still looked the same as in his high school photos.

I've been trying to get him to update his wardrobe but he's won't budge on the issue.  He likes what he wears and doesn't see the point in changing how he looks when he's going to be working from home indefinetly.  He also pointed out if he had extra money, he'd be spending it on collectibles or games instead of clothes.

So for his birthday, I got him a $500 giftcard to a clothing store.  Gerald was pissed when he opened the envelope and saw the card and not the game he wanted.  We got into a fight and now I've been staying with a friend for the last couple of days.  He doesn't want to update his clothes, and thinks I am a bitch for dictating what he can and can't wear.  Meanwhile, I just want a boyfriend who can act and dress his age.  I love him, but I don't want to date a version of him that still looks and acts the same as when we were college freshmen.  

So, AITA for getting my boyfriend a gift card to a clothing store instead of video games?

Edit: I think I really need to emphasize this.  Most of his clothes, if not all, have holes or stains on them.  He once spent a week wearing a shirt with this huge hole in the armpit.  He once went to the store wearing sweatpants with a hole large enough you could see his boxers.

And while we're at it, there is no way in hell I'm getting him a stupid game after his Among Us tantrum.

335,YTA,AITA for telling my sister it's her fault that her baby daughter likes her father more?,"My older sister has a nine-month old baby daughter who just recently learned how to crawl. My sister has always been a very career-driven woman and before she fell pregnant, she was working as a lawyer. Her husband works from home due to Covid.

Recently, my sister has been complaining to me and my mom that she feels like her baby doesn't like her and likes her husband more. I actually think this is true since when we've visited them, the baby always fusses when my sister's holding her and immediately shuts up when her husband takes her. She's been crawling and will never crawl towards my sister, always her husband. She'll talk to the baby, but she barely registers her (she just stares blankly or starts showing signs of distress). Meanwhile, the baby is always cooing happily and babbling around her dad.

Now, I'm not saying that my sister dislikes her baby, but I think she severely underestimated how big of a commitment having a child was. She had a host of physical problems during her pregnancy. She also had a difficult labor and first month. Her baby was a big crier and would apparently would wake her 5-6 times a night. After a month, my sister cited that she would go back to work since she was feeling extremely suffocated at home and that she was hated being nagged by the baby constantly. Her and her husband worked this out so she started going back to work at the firm while he took care of the baby during a big chunk of the day. They've kept this up since.

Personally, I think it's very normal that the baby is exhibiting signs of liking her father more and coldness towards my sister. She hasn't been there for her baby and they haven't had time to form a strong attachment bond. So when my sister was complaining again at a family dinner last week, I told her ""I think you should stop complaining because I think this behavior is normal given \[the reasons I stated above\]. It's your fault that your baby likes \[dad\] more because you chose your career over spending more time with your child. You chose to go back to work to avoid spending time with her because you find her annoying."" Well, she did not take that well and actually started crying at the dinner table.

336,YTA,AITA for wanting to name my baby the same name as my sister's ex boyfriend,"I've had a list of future baby names since I was 15. One boy's name that I have always adored is Mason. I'm currently 25 weeks pregnant with a boy and me and my boyfriend have been discussing names. We haven't been able to settle on a name until I said Mason. We both think it's perfect and we've agreed on it.

Unluckily my little sister was in a very toxic relationship with a guy who was emotionally abusive towards her, they broke up in late 2019. And his name was... Mason.  Obviously my sister didn't react well when I told her we wanted to name our son Mason and now every time I see her she makes passive aggressive comments, like yesterday she said my son is probably gonna grow to be an a-hole. 

To me, it's just a name. It's not like me and my SO are naming our kid after her ex. So AITA?",2020-11-24 11:06:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k031rh/aita_for_wanting_to_name_my_baby_the_same_name_as/,127,175,0.83,1
337,YTA,AITA for telling people the truth that my ex and I were never married?,"I was going to marry my child's mother at one point, it just didn't happen. At the wedding, I did one of those ""groom leaves the bride for a second to fake consult with their friends"" bits.  She freaked out, had an entire panic attack, and left to shut herself in a room. She has always had problems with anxiety, but I honestly didn't realize that this would be a problem. I regret doing that and see now that it was cruel, but I can't redo the past. By the time she had recovered, gotten her makeup redone, and gotten through vows, there was time for either pictures or signing the marriage license. We chose pictures, thinking we could just get it done the next day, but pictures had to happen because our families were leaving town. 

The next day didn't happen as it was the weekend, but neither did the next week. We had to delay our honeymoon to take her to the hospital for severe stomach pain. She found out that she was almost 4 months pregnant. Our child was born and is healthy, but that surprise pushed getting those papers done on the back burner. She started to push to get the legal part done, but we were having problems and I was scared we wouldn't last so I gave excuses. Our problems broke us up. Our child is now almost 4 and we are coparenting well.

Our families know the truth, but its kind of treated as ""close enough"". I could play along for them, but my ex has apparently convinced herself that we were married and that's she's not some ""never married single mom"". She's even telling people that she's dating that she is divorced. It's not a huge city, so when I ran into someone that she's just started dating, I clarified that I am not her ex husband because we were never married. I'm not going to pretend I was married to her when I wasn't to anyone. If her family wants to pretend that's their business, but I don't have to go along with the lie. She claims that I'm ""ruining her reputation and making her life worse"".

338,YTA,AITA for cursing out a couple who asked me to be in a polyamorous relationship?,"I (30 y.o. bisexual male) have been friends with a married couple for a few years now. We’ll call them Jennifer and Anthony. Both of them work in the same industry as me. Jennifer and Anthony are almost 10 years older than me, and established in their careers. Together, they make significantly more money than I do, and they’ve been mentors to me at various points in my career. Both are conventionally attractive and aware that I’m bisexual.

We used to go out to dinner once a week and talk about work as well as personal stuff. I’ve also been to their house several times, and have babysat their kids. However, since the pandemic started, we’ve just been Zooming once a week instead. I enjoy socializing with them and consider them to be among my closest friends.

On a recent call, however, they said they wanted to discuss the possibility of “something more serious than friendship.”

I immediately got angry. I said that, even though I’m bi, I’m neither a prostitute nor a toy, and I’m certainly not down for threesomes. They said, “No, no, that’s not what we mean,” then told me they were looking a long-term relationship, not a threesome.

I told them that, even if I were down for a polyamorous relationship, it was still unfair of them to expect me to enter a relationship where power is distributed unequally (after all, they’re much wealthier than I am and have been married for a decade, meaning every decision would be them against me). I told them to go fuck themselves and ended the call.

Since then, Jennifer has texted me several times and her husband has texted me once. I haven’t answered. I’m still angry about this, but now I worry I overreacted. Was I being an AH or what? Should I have been more polite?

Edit: no, I would not turn down a single man/woman who makes more money than me. But this is different because it's a married couple. The situation feels like they're ""hiring"" me, like they would a maid or a nanny.

Edit 2: I'm noticing a big difference in responses between people who are members of the poly community (""NTA"") and everyone else (""YTA"").",2020-09-26 02:24:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/izxdmw/aita_for_cursing_out_a_couple_who_asked_me_to_be/,1403,3349,0.92,3
339,YTA,AITA for expecting my daughter to do chores?,"I (50M) lost my wife ten years ago. It’s just me and my two kids N (17M) and E (F15), recently it caused a big stink with some family that my daughter does chores, but my son does not. I explained it’s because I have to spend extra on my daughter each month not only for her extra curriculars, but for her monthly supplies, so it‘s my way of having her pay me back. She cleans the shared living spaces and bathrooms in our apartment and cooks four meals a week. My brother said I spend twice as much on my sons extra curriculars and by my logic, he should have to do chores too. I explained he didn’t because I feel his could help him get into college but hers were just a hobby in my opinion.

E overheard me say this and was very upset. She started refusing to do chores because it isn’t fair. I told her she’d still be doing her chores and life isn’t fair so stop being a brat, or I’d refuse to pay for her extra curricular stuff or pads. I wouldn’t actually do that, but I was mad when I said it. She packed a bag and took off. She’s been staying with my sister who called me an abusive asshole when I demanded she send E home. My brother and sister are coddling her and I’m furious. N said I was being an asshole to E and that’s why she left. I’m completely fed up with the whole thing. AITA for expecting her to do chores?

ETA: My son plays Football and Baseball while you daughter is in choir and a dance group, so yes I do think my son has a better chance at getting a scholarship. I’m not sexist and I don’t appreciate being called one, and for those of you messaging me saying you hope someone calls CPS on me, I’m not doing anything wrong so that’s just stupid.

340,YTA,WIBTA if we celebrated our birthday without our triplet?,"My sisters and I (the oldest) are fraternal triplets. Our sister “Grace” the youngest, was born with some physical delays; so my middle sister “Hannah”and I tended to bond because Mom and Dad were busy caring for Grace. Don’t get me wrong we all love each other. But Hannah and I are best friends.
Anyway, every year for our birthday the three of us always have a special gathering. Usually it’s themed. This year we are turning 20 and Hannah and I want to celebrate by taking a 2 month road trip. Going to several states, camping, and enjoying nature.
Because of Graces physical delays it would be impossible for her to go with us. We plan to have a small dinner at home then head out our trip.  Grace doesn’t know about it. I know she would want to go. 
We’ve been on a few “hiking” trips with her but my sister and I want to do something more intense. 
But would we be assholes if we celebrated without her?


:::::: 

We ended up telling Grace about the road trip today . And she went into her regular rant. She told mom and dad that we can’t go. Grace doesn’t want to join on the hiking she called it “only for (homophobic slur)but she doesn’t want us to copy her trip (Grace and her friends did a similar trip two years go for our birthday)

She called us the usual bad names. Insulted Hannah by using homophobic slurs(Hannah is bisexual)

We told her that she could join us for the hospital thing but she said she would come only if she can bring her friends and boyfriend 

Now Mom and Dad are working on booking tickets for them to (probably) meet us for the trip 
Mom and Dad also said that they can’t give us the birthday money that we were depending on for the trip. It will pay for the plane tickets. 

Grace wins. And everyone (except Hannah and I) are happy

Which is what everyone wishes. Grace to be happy

341,YTA,AITA for defending my decision to not tell my husband about my past?,"When I was 21, I had a daughter with somebody I worked with. 

We never married but moved in together for a while. However, I soon realized that we had nothing in common and that I didn’t want to work at a grocery store for the rest of my life, living paycheck to paycheck. 

Meanwhile I felt like I was not appreciated at home and did not feel anything towards the father of my daughter and I was sick of him getting in and out of trouble with the law. 

I ended up leaving when my daughter was 4. I moved across the country to my aunt’s home in Atlanta and went to community college there. 

Later I went to Miami and met my now husband. We hit it off right away and I realized I didn’t want to bring in information that would potentially sour our relationship.

We’ve been married for three years and I work as an executive VP at his company.  

This weekend, my aunt came to visit. This was the first time she was meeting my husband besides very briefly at our wedding. 

Before he came home I pulled her aside and asked that she not let anything slip about the fact I have a 12 year old daughter out there. 

She was shocked I never told him and said that it was unfair to him. I got pretty pissed and reminded my aunt that after my ex contacted me several times through the years, he had finally said he never wanted to deal with me again.

And that to want me to drag up inconvenient pieces of information regarding a mistake I had made in my past was insensitive. 

I asked why she would try to ruin both my marriage and my working relationship with my husband when we all have things from the past we’d like to change.

342,YTA,AITA to ask my sons to help pay for my youngest daughter’s wedding because they already had lavish weddings thrown by their wives’ wealthy families?,"Thorny issue, need some outsider perspective.

I’m recently retired and my husband passed away 10 years ago. Finances wise, I do enough to keep myself happy, but I don’t have a ton of money or assets at all. 

Anyways, I have two older sons who are now in their 30s who got married 3-5 years ago. They both married women from fairly wealthy families. So their weddings were all very extravagant in the 70-90k range. Imagine 250 people weddings in the center of a big city. 

Now, my youngest is 26 and getting married next year. Her fiancé is still in graduate school and his parents are just middle class. They said they can’t contribute because they’re in quite a lot of debt as well. I can’t contribute anything beyond a few thousand dollars. 

A few nights ago my daughter called me crying. She said she’s upset thinking about how little they have to pay for this wedding, and it’s worse knowing her brothers had these amazing events and she’ll only have a dinky, backyard thing. She said her dream was to have the kind of grand wedding her brothers had but she would walk the aisle this time. She asked me if I thought she was a failure in life and it just broke my heart. 

So yesterday I called my sons and asked them to consider paying the bulk of their sister’s wedding so she can have a beautiful one like they did. Immediately they start giving excuses so I got mad and told them this isn’t how they treat family and to think of their baby sister and the wedding she should deserve. 

AITA for asking? They are both doing very well in life and lucked out in not having to pay for their own weddings. I felt like it would be more than reasonable to chip in for their baby sister’s wedding, who does not have the same privileges as them but still deserves the same as them.",2020-10-12 22:59:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ja1l3c/aita_to_ask_my_sons_to_help_pay_for_my_youngest/,693,1836,0.9,0
343,NTA,AITA for serving vegan food at my wedding?,"My fiance and I are getting married in June next year. We're both vegans, and although we don't judge those who are not vegan, we wanted to serve vegan food at our wedding. We found a vegan caterer.

When we sent out invitations, we added a note saying that the food will be vegan. We also asked that everyone who has any specific dietary requirements let us know. The note made it clear that anyone who needed a specific diet would be catered for. 

Soon after the invitations went out, my aunt phoned us in a huff. My uncle does not want vegan food; he needs to eat meat, she said. I asked what his dietary requirements are, thinking that he has a specific medical condition and cannot eat a vegan meal. She said his reasons are ""cultural"" and he must eat meat. I said that's not really a good enough reason, we all come from the same culture and it's not like it's a sin to not eat meat with every single meal. 

I explained to her that I wouldn't really mind him eating meat but 1) it means I'll have to bring in a new caterer for one meal, which will be expensive and 2) I don't want to pay for meat if I don't have to. Again, I'm not judging non-vegans, but it doesn't sit right with me. 

Weeks went by. The only people who had dietary requirements were three cousins, who eat a low-carb diet. My vegan caterer came up with vegan, low-carb meals, and my cousins were happy with this plan. Upon hearing this, my aunt phoned me again, angrier this time, asking why my uncle can't be catered for because he ""doesn't like"" vegan food.

I refused again. I told her that the food consists of things I KNOW he eats anyway: vegetables, coconut, nuts, etc. I went through a list of ingredients I knew would be in the food and she admitted he has no intolerances/allergies to any of that stuff. What's the big deal with him skipping meat one time? I told her that if he's so adamant about the meat he can buy himself McDonalds and eat it at the kiddy table.

Now my aunt isn't talking to me, and is instead talking shit about me to all my family members. I told her that they are welcome to simply not attend the wedding if they're going to bitch about the food.

I understand that veganism is not possible or sustainable for many people in the long-term but come on - it's ONE meal, that is FREE. 

AITA? I don't want to seem like a ""pushy vegan"" but I also don't want to pay for meat unless I have to. Again, it's one meal out of their whole life.",2020-11-25 07:50:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k0nuyg/aita_for_serving_vegan_food_at_my_wedding/,3024,23421,0.92,112
344,NTA,"AITA for telling my family that if they want Thanksgiving, they'll have to get off their asses and plan it?","Usually for Thanksgiving, we head out to go see family. Someone else always hosts (we typically help ""sponsor"" the host by paying for clean-up, etc, our home is just too small to host the 30+ folks who typically show up through the day). This year that's obviously not happening.

Other than us talking about not doing the usual, Thanksgiving didn't come up until yesterday. My kids have the week off from online school, and I was doing a puzzle with them before dinner when my husband walks in after work and says: ""So did we get a turkey?""

I looked at him and said ""Well, I know I didn't. Did you?""

He stared at me blankly and said ""No. What do you mean? Do we need to get one still? Is it being delivered?""

I shrugged and said ""I don't know nothing about no turkey.""

The kids and he looked so confused, so I helped them along and said ""I didn't buy anything. I didn't plan anything. No one said anything to me about Thanksgiving. Nobody offered to help meal plan, cook anything, do anything.""

He blew up yelling at me about how I should have obviously known.

I said, why? I've literally never planned or made a Thanksgiving dinner in my life. The most I've ever done was help clean up or maybe peel the potato. I asked him why didn't ***HE*** plan anything, why didn't the kids plan anything? Why is everyone waiting until the last minute and dumping it on me?

He just sputtered and yelled and stormed off to his ""office"" and left me with the kids. We all had dinner, the kids cleaned up, and I was relaxing with some wine and a book after they all went to bed. My husband tore into me about how he can't believe I left this all to the last minute, now there will be no Thanksgiving, how could I know be heartbroken to do this to the kids, etc.

So I just looked at him and said ""Why didn't you plan? Why did you wait to the last minute to ask me?""

He told me I was being a fucking bitch for no reason and stomped off to go sleep in his office. He left without saying a word this morning. I followed up with my kids and asked them if they wanted Thanksgiving. They said they didn't care because the food isn't that good most of the time anyway.

Before you ask, yup, I work as well. We split chores but there's no hardline. I do some, he does some. We both cook, and the oldest cooks as well. I just don't get why Thanksgiving is on my plate. Why, just because I'm a woman? Lmao fuck that.

AITA?

**ETA:** Thanks for the judgments, all. A lot of people seem to think that my kids are like, toddlers or something. They're old enough to help make the menu for dinners, help with cooking, etc. It's weird how many people came up with info here, like I was ""getting down on the floor playing"" rather than me and the kids... sitting at the table doing a puzzle.

Anyway, I told my husband that if he wants to do some traditional Thanksgiving with all the fattening, carby, salty, beige food, he can go ahead and plan it and I'll help in the same capacity as always. If he wants me and the kids to cook something together (aka a normal, average Thursday) I'll continue with what was scheduled.

The kids genuinely do not care. Thanksgiving doesn't mean anything to them. One of them has been asking for us to stay home for years. One of them barely touches the food as it, and the other one only likes to go so she can see her cousins, and she sees them all the time anyway. The middle kid already dug out another puzzle for us and they're just happy they're off school.

Also, we don't do Christmas.

345,NTA,AITA for leaving my husband in the grocery store because he started acting like a toddler?,"We all go through phases and pick up annoying habits, and sometimes we just need our loved ones to gently tell us if we've picked up a particularly egregious habit.

Sometime in the last year, my husband has picked up a habit where he talks like a baby. At first it was funny, but passed into embarrassing, cringeworthy behavior quickly.

Examples: doggo, pupper, woofer/subwoofer, pibble, hooty-boy, peepo, birb, meowmeow, sammy, sammiches, sammywhammy, chicky nuggies, chicky tendies, adding a toddleresque ""lisp"" to words, and the ones that really get gross are childish euphemisms for genitalia or sex.

I cannot emphasize this enough: it is not endearing or sexy to have my husband talk about my ""boobies"" and his ""weiner"" and ""weenie"" and ""wee wee"", ""hoohas"" and ""bajingos"" (Nostalgia for Scrubs be damned). We have not had sex for six months because he cannot stop talking about my ""boobies"" and it makes me sick.

Just before the pandemic hit, we were out at a restaurant with some friends, he actually ordered a ""chicky sammy"" like, said that exact phrase. Chicky. Sammy. Look, it's totally fine that he ordered the chicken sandwich. That's not the issue. Our friends noticed the baby talk, because he insisted on continuing the ""joke"" and even started talking with this god awful toddler... lilt? Accent?

After that, I just couldn't stomach the idea of going out with him to adult places. I'd go out to the brewery with friends, but god forbid he join me and say ""Me wanty 'nother beer!"" or something.

I don't know where it came from. I don't know why he's doing this. I finally hit my limit when we were grocery shopping and everything seemed normal and fine until he gasped like a kid, ran to the ice cream section and jumped up and down yelling ""ICE CWEAM ICE CWEAM! I WANT CHOCWIT!""

I was *MORTIFIED*. People were staring at him and me. He kept going and kept saying ""CAN WE GET POPSICOOOS?"" and I just said ""Either talk to me like an adult or I'm leaving.""

He started saying OOOOOO YOU MUST BE FUN AT PARTIES and LIGHTEN UP, WILL YOU? And shit like that. I just said fuck it, and left the store, leaving him to walk home (like a mile, it was fine) because I couldn't even look at him.

Since then, things have been very tense, and he keeps telling me that he wants an apology for embarrassing him by leaving him in the store. I told him that people don't get to demand apologies, if someone wants to apologize, it's up to them, and I am absolutely not going to apologize for saving myself the embarrassment of a 35 year old man with a mortgage and retirement account asking for ""CHOCWIT ICE CWEAM.""

He got his fucking Mom involved, no joke. She keeps telling me it's just a phase and that he's probably bored and I should be happy this is his midlife crisis, rather than him fucking 19 year olds at the local bar.

I'm going crazy. AITA? Do I really just need to let my husband continuously embarrass me like this?

**Edit:** Sorry, there was only so much space. I *have* talked to him. Multiple times. Especially about the sexual comments. I've made it extremely, abundantly clear that him using terms like ""boobies"" and ""wee wee"" are absolutely *repulsive* to me, among other things he says.

**INFO:** Does he have a job? Yes, and he acts completely normal as far as I know. He worked from home for a while during lockdown, and I never heard him talk like this to anyone he worked with. 

**Does he do it with friends?** Sometimes, and it's generally meant to annoy them or gross them out, but he stops. He has friends where they think its ""cute"" to embarrass each other. 

**Is this a kink/fetish?:** If so, I'm absolutely done. (Edited because it was offensive)

**Has he seen a doctor?**: No, but I've asked him if he needed to talk to someone because he was acting strange, and he accused me of being stuck up and judgmental. Given that he doesn't act like this with his coworkers, or his family, and only jokes around with his friends, I'm willing to bet that this is an indication that he's trying to force this fetish on me nonconsensually, or trying to get me to leave.

**Is it a tumor?**: I don't know. Like I said above, I asked him if he needed to see someone. I can't force him (even if I want to, just find out if there's any way we can salvage this), but after this post closes I will try to get him to. Maybe his sister can encourage him, even though he acts completely normal around them.

**Does he have childhood trauma?:** As far as I know, and I'm relatively close to his family and would likely know, the most traumatic thing he had happen was a minor car accident when he was around 13 years old. No injuries, no death, etc. He hasn't been in a car accident in the past two years or anything like that, and I haven't, and AFAIK no one else in his family has been, etc.

**I want to send you a chat instead of my comment getting lost**: Please don't. I've had a number of people repost this to make fun of me because I didn't respond the way they wanted, etc. Just comment, I can at least to respond to those and help others get an idea of what's going on.",2020-11-19 19:08:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jx90uv/aita_for_leaving_my_husband_in_the_grocery_store/,4114,23962,0.95,94
346,NTA,AITA for being “too honest” about why I don’t drink?,"I’m 33 and I had a serious drinking problem since a young age. My dad was an alcoholic so booze never lacked in our house. It nearly killed me when I was only 27 and was in the ER for alcohol poisoning. 
It was too close a call and after that things had to change. With my wife’s support, I went to rehab and proud to say I’ve been sober 5 1/2yrs. 

My flatmate invited our friends over yesterday. It was 7 of us in total, including his friend, “Mark.” I’ve met Mark maybe 3-4 times over the last 2 years and while we’re “friendly” i honestly don’t know him that well. But you can tell he’s a party-guy. Likes to get loud, take shots, makes gross comments sometimes, etc.

Mark brought several cases of beer and a bottle of tequila with him so everyone was drinking and having a good time. 

Mark kept offering me drinks the entire night, which I’d politely decline. It’s like he made it his personal mission to get me to drink by egging me on, saying everytime he sees me I’m either drinking a soda/water and it’s okay to let loose sometimes. He resorted to teasing me into drinking, calling me “princess”; I don’t know what that had to do with not wanting to drink.

All my friends there knew what I was like before, how bad my drinking was so they kept trying to steer the conversation so he’d forget about me. But every now and then he’d hand me a shot glass or a beer and would not let it go even after telling him yet again that I didn’t want to drink. 

My wife became uncomfortable with his behavior (I think she was worried I’d actually drink). She grabbed the shot glass from me, dumped it in the sink and told him to stop it already. He looked between us and grinned like he “understood now”. 

Mark joked that maybe we should get my wife drunk first, then that’ll get her to loosen up the leash she has on me. I’ll admit, that made me see red. I got in his face and told him, “actually I don’t drink because last time I did I almost f*cking died so unless you want me puking everywhere and having seizures you should shut up and leave my wife out of this.”

Wiped the smile off him real quick and he apologized. The rest of night went on and he finally left me alone. 

Our flatmate did confront me in the morning because he thinks I was too honest with Mark and it wasn’t his fault he didn’t know; he was just joking around and I made him feel bad. Our other friends agree he was being too pushy and deserved being told off, my wife agrees so he’s the only one right now that’s taking Mark’s side.

He said I could’ve ignored him until he gave up instead of bringing up an uncomfortable truth from my past. 

Now yes I could’ve just told Mark the truth without full details but felt that’s none of his business and a “no” should’ve been enough. 

I only got carried away when he decided to include my wife in his jokes. So yes I am wondering if I was a bit of an a-hole for what I told him instead of keeping the peace.",2020-11-27 10:52:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k1z30n/aita_for_being_too_honest_about_why_i_dont_drink/,2138,22008,0.93,52

While I was there, I was window shopping and saw that they had a computer for $89. I only really use a computer for youtube or websites and my laptop is pretty old so I tested this computer, everything worked so I bought it. The next day, I got a call and it was from the manager of the shop. He was very rude from the start and told me that the computer was labeled incorrectly and told me(didn't ask, rudely ordered me) to come in that day and either A.) return the computer or B.) pay the difference. I asked that the difference was and he said over $800. I guess it was supposed to be labeled $899.

I said I'd think about it and he said that if I wasn't in by the end of the day, he'd just charge my card the amount. I told him that he can't do that and he said if I didn't bring it in, or pay the difference, he was gonna ban me from the store and also call the police for theft. I just said I'd thnk about it again. I think he was mad cause the last thing he said to me was ""listen, b\*\*\*ch, either bring it in or go to jail, your choice"". Or ""you decide"". Something like that. Then ended the call. I don't think the police can even do anything cause the price sticker is still on the computer and I have a receipt of the transaction for the $89 and there's probably also camera footage of me buying it and he must have a record of the purchase too. 

&#x200B;

It's not my fault that him or an employee labeled it incorrectly and it's not like I knew it was a wrong price when I bought it. I just saw a cheap computer that worked and bought it. I asked my friend who's into computers to look at it and see if it's actually worth that much or if this guy's just trying to scam me or something and he said that the parts are pretty high end and expensive. I don't think I did anything wrong but my friend said that I should take it back so idk.",2020-11-24 01:09:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jzuz57/aita_for_refusing_to_return_a_computer_i_bought/,2340,20196,0.97,18
348,NTA,AITA for having kicked my DIL out of my Thanksgiving meal after her vegan feast fiasco?,"My daughter (21) lives with us while finishing college. My son (27) lives in the same city and I babysit his children (3 and 4), so we are bubbled. My sister, who drove three hours with her husband and son (16) to come and see us, has been taking extra precautions prior to this event. Everyone was safe.

DIL and I don't get along for many reasons I won't go into. She's also just one of those condescending people who thinks that constantly looks down on others, especially because of her veganism. Last Thanksgiving, she raised hell over me making a turkey, and claimed there weren't really any vegan options. There were.

Last week, DIL contacts me on FB asking for the ""menu"", and then telling me what ""will"" and ""won't"" work. She also sent me many replication recipes  to make for her, with expensive specialty items in all of them, many I didn't even know what they were. This annoyed me, because I had already made sure to give my son, her, and her kids vegan options for the day, but it wasn't good enough. I finally just told her to go pound sand, and that she could bring her own dish for her family if she'd be that picky.

Thanksgiving happens. They arrive late with a *ton* of food dishes, parading them in, all with this vindictive grin on her face. Turns out, she, out of spite, took the *exact* menu, and made her own version of every single dish. Needless to say, I was livid, but I held my tongue. My sister and daughter in particular did try the food and enjoy it. Every time they complimented her, she would give me this look as she received her thanks, before tacking on something like ""I just wanted to make a Thanksgiving meal that *everyone* could enjoy.""

The part where I finally snapped was at dessert. We have a family tradition where right before we sit down and say what we're thankful for. Its usually for family, or being able to gather. When at her turn, she got the same smug, vindictive grin on her face, and in the most condescending way, said ""I'm thankful for starting the *new* tradition of a cruelty free, inclusive Thanksgiving, and I hope it continues next year!""

Reddit, I saw red. I waited until my turn, and then said, as calmly as I could, that I was thankful that this would be the last Thanksgiving I'd be spending with her.  It took them a moment to catch on, and soon enough nasty words were being exchanged on both sides. I finally kicked them out.

I didn't think about it until this evening, when my son sent me a text telling me that he would not be letting his children come over until I personally apologize to his wife. He said that while he sees my side, she ""didn't mean it"", and that I took it way too far by publicly embarrassing her, when she spent so much time making food for everyone.  My husband is telling me I should just apologize, because it was rude of me and isn't worth it. He doesn't really get why it hurt me so much that she copied my meal to ""one up"" me, and thinks the more food, the merrier.

AITA here? Let me know.

&#x200B;

Edit for info: word count is limiting!

I absolutely had vegan options for them to begin with. I had an entree for them (plus some backup nuggets for the kdis), a few side dishes (most were vegan with nonvegan addons), and a dessert that I made. She told me that those were fine, but the other entrees ""wouldn't work"" and that I needed to make them all vegan. It wasn't a request to make something in particular, it was a demand that I redo everything. My son let it slip that she spent ""hundreds of dollars"" on the food to make what she did, and he seemed to blame me for that.

Another note is that although the threat of the grandchildren hurts every time, it isn't the first time. Last time she made it two weeks and gave in, because they rely on the free child care four times a week while she's working.

I did not literally tell her to go pound sand. That is an expression. I told her that was the menu, and it will not be changed, but she was welcome to bring her own dish for her family.

**Another edit:**

Wow! This really blew up! I have a mini update. I've spoken with my husband, and I've told him that I flatout feel unappreciated. I spent *days* making this meal, and for him, who watched me struggle, to blow it off as nothing was honestly hurtful. I additionally reminded him of the other issues we've had, and have informed that I'm no longer going to be taking this from her *or* my son. He is welcome to talk to them if he likes, but I, personally, am done. I am done being their free labor. I am done being her punching bag and power step. I am done just all around. We talked it a bit more, and he respects my choice and has apologized for his part in this.

Next, I told my son that if he wants to continue to try and manipulate me with his grandchildren, then I think its best we cut contact for a while, because I'm beyond hurt. I have explained my side to him (in tears), and it was met with an ""I know, but"". I just told him to stop. He gets free childcare. Its manipulative. He claims he isn't a part of it and its just his wife and ""I know how she is"", but I'm realizing that he's actually a huge part of it for enabling. I've told him that I'm always there for his children, but that for now, I'd rather not have contact with them unless there's a dire emergency with no other options, or they *both* apologized, and that includes the consistent free labor. His response was that I was making it difficult, because his wife would be upset if he apologized to me. That solidified my decision, and I've cut contact.

My daughter is aware of what is happening. She's taken my side on this.

**PLEASE DO NOT SEND ME HATE DMS ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL OPINION OVER ME NOT BEING VEGAN. YOU WILL SIMPLY BE REPORTED AND BLOCKED. I WILL NOT BE ANSWERING.

349,NTA,AITA for having my daughter write a 'morbid' school family tree project?,"My biological family is dead. I was raised in foster care, and so my friends are my family. I met my late husband in college. He was just raised by his mother, who had abandoned him and later died (no adoptive family). As an adult, I've looked into both trees and our biological ancestors are, to put it mildly, really dangerous people and/or dead. My late husband and older son died in a car crash.

My daughter is in kindergarten and she, more accurately me, was supposed to do a family tree project for school. I tried speaking to her teacher that this was not going to be a Pollyanna report, but she is one of those people that can't comprehend that sometimes family is a dark subject, and insisted that it needed to be biological. So, I did it.

Some of them, like her father and my son, I have actual information for aside from that they're dead. But for most of my family and her paternal family, I literally only have birth date, death date, when they would have had their kids, and cemetery information, unless they were cremated.

It was supposed to have 10 pictures, but most of the pictures I have of any ancestors are just headstones. I made a trip when my husband and I first married to take pictures of the headstones, so I included those in there. I only have 3 pictures total of my biological family, and most of them are group shots where I could only label maybe 3 people. I don't have any pictures of my late husband's family from before me and my kids, but I put some of the old ones in there too.

So while the other kids had long family trees, my daughter was basically introducing the concept of death to her kindergarten class. Now I'm getting slammed with calls from other parents, the teacher, and the principal. They're appalled that I allowed such a ""morbid"" report and are saying I traumatized their children. I don't think I did anything wrong. They wanted a report on her biological ancestors, I gave it, and kept it G-rated. I just didn't lie that people were alive when they weren't. I don't raise her to think that death is taboo or something to be ashamed of anyway. Death is part of life. Most of her/my family is dead, so talking about family just means talking about death, and it's just something you have to accept.

I found out my sister is pretending to be my daughter's mother,"When my (27F) fiancé and I first announced my pregnancy to my family, my sister (34F) was a little jealous, I'm assuming it's because she was trying for a baby with her ex partner but they broke up because he was a cheat. 

I gave birth to my daughter seven months ago. Her name is Kaia. When I returned to work after 12 weeks of maternity leave, my sister offered to babysit Kaia once a week which has been incredibly helpful. 

Not too long ago, one of my close friends who also recently had a child approached me to tell me that my sister is in a mothers group on Facebook and she's posting photos of Kaia and she's calling my daughter HERS and she's also calling her by a different name. My friend sent me screenshots of my sister's posts and I was completely disturbed so I spoke to my fiancé and we both decided we had to take action immediately. I went over to my sister's and asked her directly about what she was posting on Facebook, she did not deny it and also had no explanation. Therefore I told her that she's banned from seeing my daughter. My sister flipped out and said that I can't take Kaia away from her and then called me a ""selfish b!tch"" and she started crying. I have NEVER seen my sister act this was before, it was alarming. I ask her if there's anything else I need to know because she may as well just spill everything, so she shows me a framed photo she has in her bedroom of her and my daughter and on the frame is written ""mother and daughter."" I'm not going to lie, I did call her crazy and then I left and haven't spoken to her since, although she continues to try and come over and calls me multiple times a day.

352,NTA,AITA for taking back my nephews Christmas present and giving it to my son.,"My sister and I have always had a strained relationship. I usually just let things go and try to keep the piece. We both have sons who are around the same age. My nephew is 13 and my son just turned 11. For my sons birthday I bought him the new gaming system he has been wanting. He was absolutely thrilled and he plays nonstop. 

My sister is bad with money. I usually have to lend her money for bills and stuff for my nephew. I know my nephew doesn’t always get the best Christmas gifts so this year I went a little crazy and I purchased the same gaming system for him for Christmas. I already had it ready and wrapped under my tree.

Yesterday my sisters family came to visit. My son asked me if they could go play video games. I said yes and reminded them to be careful. About 30 minutes later my son comes running to me crying. I asked him what was wrong and he led me to the front hall. When we get to the stairs I see the new system smashed on the floor. Someone had thrown it from the upstairs and it was now smashed to pieces.

I asked my son what happened and he sobbed and pointed at his cousin. I asked my nephew if he did this and he started to laugh. He said that it was a “stupid baby toy” and that he saw people break them online. 

My sister came in and I told her what happened. I explained that this was an expensive system and that her son needs to be disaplined for what he did. I told her I wanted her to pay for what her son broke.

She laughed and said no. She says I shouldn’t have let them play unsupervised. That it was my fault and that I am a bad parent. She said my son will get over it and that it was not important. 

Seeing my son sitting on the ground next to his broken system trying to put the pieces back together tore my heart out. I walked over to the Christmas tree and grabbed the system that was meant for my nephew. I pulled the gift wrap off and it gave it to son and told him to go upstairs and set it up.

My sister asked me why I was making such a big deal when I had another one already. I than laughed and told her that was her sons Christmas gift. That since it wasn’t important and it was just a stupid baby toy than they obviously won’t miss it. I than told them to leave.

My nephew realized what happened and began to cry that my son had stole his system. I said no his was the one that he smashed. My sister was livid and told me that I will never see them again. I just said okay and slammed the door.

Other family members have now been calling me nonstop and saying I am an asshole and that I ruined my nephews Christmas. I don’t think so though. My nephew is 13. He is not a stupid kid and he knew what he was doing. I don’t care that it was over jealousy, he is old enough to know better. My sister was not going to make the situation right so I just did what I had to do.

They all think I should buy another new system for him but I don’t have that kind of money. I’m starting to feel bad about this and I am wondering AITA?",2020-11-15 17:14:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jupcwq/aita_for_taking_back_my_nephews_christmas_present/,2653,30976,0.94,161
353,NTA,AITA for leaving the call when my brother announced that his gf is pregnant?,"My brother and I do not get on.

When we were younger he'd go out of his way to make my life a living hell. To my parent's credit they did tell him off for it when they caught him but they both worked long hours and didn't have the energy to deal with our arguments. This continued into adulthood. He was salty that he failed his college course the first time around.

There was a bad argument in our family a while ago and, I shit you not, it all started because I refused the decorate my brothers living room. I wont go into too much detail but he wanted a pretty hefty discount, I said no and he threw a tantrum.

You really need to meet my brother to understand just how bad he is. But hopefully this post will do it some justice. Instead of being a grown up and talking to me, he decided to hook up with my toxic ex girlfriend and the mother of my child. Due to the rules here I can't go into a lot of detail about what she was like but she was not a nice person. She never really bonded with our son when he was born and I was left to do everything by myself. She eventually walked out on us and refused to have any contact with our son. She'll post on Facebook now and then about her beautiful baby boy to get sympathy votes but that's about it.

I have been a single dad for almost three years now and I absolutely adore my son but it hurts to think that one day he might question why his mum didn't want anything to do with him. How am I supposed to explain that to him?

Anyway, it bothered me when my brother told me they'd hooked up together. It hurt even more when he started dating her. It had taken me so long to get over what she did to me and my child and now my own brother was bringing her back into my life.

Yesterday we had a family video call (parents are high risk and we're not taking any chances) when my brother decided to announce that he and my ex were expecting.

I just froze, I didn't know what to do or think. I could feel myself starting to cry a little bit and it got a bit harder to breathe. Eventually I decided to just congratulate them and then made up some lie about needing to put my son down for a nap and left.

I received a bunch of messages from my brother and his gf telling me that I stole their thunder. After I left, my parents and some other family members started worrying if I was okay and not really focusing on their news. My uncle told me that I should've just ""been a man"" and stuck it out instead of making excuses to get out of it, after all it was expected that our kids would be raised around each other.

I feel like maybe I shouldn't have left the call but at the same time it would've been worse if I'd stayed and had a full blown panic attack in front of everyone. Some of the family members are split and have argued that I won't be able to avoid my brother and his family forever but others believe I was in the right to leave that situation. I don't know what to think

EDIT

I just wanted to say thank you first of all for all the support. I fell asleep last night and woke up to so many kind and supportive comments.  

A lot of people have been asking how my parents feel about this. They aren't happy but they don't have the energy to deal with all the hassle my brother would cause. They actually cut him off for a little wile when he started dating my ex but he phoned them constantly and, again can't go into much detail, but he said he'd do something not so good. They keep him at arms length but I have told them not to cut contact because of me. If they want to cut contact on their own accord then that's fine but I do not want to be the reason that they have to deal with his tantrums.

The rest of the family, for the most part, weren't happy about it but accepted it (or pretended to) when they started getting a bit more serious. My uncle )who told me to be a man) thought it was funny, that's just the kind of person he is.

I think as hard as it might be, I am going to cut off contact with my brother and ex. As a lot of people pointed out, not for my sake but for the sake of my son. I don't want to put him through all that.

354,NTA,AITA For reporting my son's doctor after she shared his medical information with my mother in law?,"My F38 son 9 has a medical condition. We're struggling so much trying to do everything we can to help him deal and cope with his condition. It's been difficult enough without my mother in law getting involved and making decisions without talking to me and my husband first. She'd completely disregard our fears and concerns as parents and claim we don't know what's best for her grandson by trying to control doctors appointments/arguing with doctors. Criticizing and telling them how to do their job/ bringing medication that her friend doctor prescribed without even diagnosing my son.

She'd get mad if we don't comply and do what she tells us. Her latest stunt was showing up at my son's appointment and making a scene resulting in me and my husband going no contact and changing the clinic by having my son's medical file transformed to another clinic.

My mother in law was removed from any emergency contact we had before and we made it clear to the new doctor to not share our son's medical information. My mother in law kept trying to find out what clinic/which doctor our son goes to and she tried to guilty tip my husband and also get the family to pressure us into letting her know. No one realized the negative affect she had on my son's health and progress and the family kept calling me awful and resentful because she's just worried for her grandson.

Last week. I found out that my mother in law was at the clinic and was speaking to my son's pediatrician about my son's condition. My husband told me his mom called and told him she was talking to the doctor discussing our son's condition. He told me he didn't want to speak to his mom but she called to let him know that she has a right to take part in her grandson's care and that we shouldn't try to hide things from her since she eventually was able to find out.

I was livid. I was so angry I went to talk to the doctor about the conversation she had with my mother in law and the fact that she disclosed medical information after being told several times that this would cause us plenty of issues because of my mother in law's behavior. Mother in law is already trying to get involved and I just couldn't take it. I reported the doctor and filled an HIPAA complaint.

I was told to back off but I couldn't take this massive lack of professionalism on the doctor's part and the fact that now I'm having to deal with my mother in law's attempts to control the situation.

My mother in law spread the news about the doctor and the whole family was stunned saying my bitterness jeopardized the doctor's career and that she only shared information with my son's grandmother not some stranger. Also said that I'm not being focused on my son and choosing to start arguments instead. Basically made it look like it's my fault. I'm so tired and I can't take it anymore. My husband agrees that I shouldn't have filed a complaint like he has no problem with his mother now showing up at the clinic and causing scenes.


Information to add here: my son goes to a licensed medical doctor. Mother in law says she knows a doctor that happens to be friend of hers but I'm not sure if he even has a license or even work at the hospital or clinic we were never told who he was nor even met him before. But that was before the fight we had with her. She no longer mentions him and is focused on getting directly involved with my son's care.",2020-11-22 17:37:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jyzogq/aita_for_reporting_my_sons_doctor_after_she/,1834,19759,0.94,40
355,NTA,AITA For Refusing To Crochet Something For My Brother's Future Baby After Years Of Teasing?,"Throwaway Account

I (24m) have never been like the other men in my family. I'm introverted, artistic, and would rather cosplay than play sports. At age 14 my great-grandmother moved in with us and she taught me how to crochet. I loved it but my brothers, Jim (27m) and Tim (27m), used to tease me constantly for it when she wasn't around and whenever I would complain my dad told me that life's full of people that are going to call me names and that I need to ""toughen"" up. I honestly think he was just disappointed that I wasn't an extroverted jock like him and his other sons, felt like he could just pressure me into becoming more like him.

When my great-grandmother died she didn't have much but she specifically left me her crochet ""hooks"" and I was very touched. She also left my cousin an unfinished baby socks that she was crocheting for the my cousin's baby, and I could tell my cousin was disappointed. We kind of had this tradition of our great-grandmother making things for the coming babies. I offered to finish what our great-grandmother started, using her hooks, and my cousin was thrilled at the gesture.

After that I kinda inherited the position of crocheting things for any new babies in the family and I rather enjoyed it because I felt as if I was carrying on a legacy. Although, it did nothing to stop my mediate family from making jokes and calling me names. Despite the constant attacks against my sexuality Jim, ironically, came out as gay and has since apologized for his past treatment of me so we're on good terms but Tim is still a jerk to me.

When I went to college I went low-contact with Tim and my father and would just tolerate them at family events. Last week Tim announced that he and his girlfriend, Tina (24f) were engaged and expecting their first child over social media and everyone was thrilled. During a zoom meeting with the family Tina said she would love a matching blanket, little hat and shoes for the baby from me, and I asked her to send me a copy of her registry for baby clothes. Tim laughed and said everyone knows that it's tradition that I make the items. I told him flat out that he doesn't get to make fun of my skills as a crocheter and then expect free labor from me.

My dad said that I was being rude and needed to apologize. I countered that if Tim was hurt by my refusal to crochet for him then he should just ""toughen"" up and get over it and then left the call. Since then I've been getting text messages from my parents and Tim saying that I'm being petty and a jerk to Tina and the baby, but I haven't responded. AITA for refusing to crochet something for my brother's baby after years of teasing?

Edit: Okay since I keep seeing this I'm just going to give some info. Yes I am aware that you crochet with HOOKS and not ""needles."" When my great-grandmother was teaching me she referred to them as a ""needle."" Granted she obviously made a mistake but when I was first learning it just stuck so that what I always refer to them personally and I will correct it.

356,NTA,Aita: For giving my deceased son's college fund to his best friend instead of my nephew?,"
This has been causing a conflict with my entire family. And they think that I'm being selfish and unreasonable. Let me explain first.

I M39 lost my son in 2019 due to a chronic heart condition. He was 15 years old. It was devastating and I just couldn't take it especially when my family did little to nothing to support me during these difficult times. They didn't bring my son meals when he was at the hospital. They didn't let me go home and rest even for a few hours. They didn't take care of other things while I had a lot to deal with I wasn't offered any help just words. They'd just talk but do nothing.

Despite the struggle. I've created an account for my son's college fund and kept putting whatever I could get at the time and me and my son would talk about that a lot. He was depressed but always believed that he was going to get better and continue his education and attend college.

I started saving money To keep him motivated and to make him feel like he could be like any other kid with hopes for a good future. He had a very close friend that's about the same age as him. They were friends for 5 years, and I can't express how his presence in my son's life helped him through the worst days, sometimes his friend would spend the night with us and try to get my son to do activities and lighten up his mood all the time. To be frank his friend was closer to him than his own family.

He never stopped visiting and asking how I'm doing after my son's death. He'd show me handmade projects he made for my son and as a way to remember him and we'd sometimes just sit and talk together or cry together. 

Last week. While I was with my family my sister asked me what I was going to do with my son's college money. I didn't wanna mention this but since she asked I told her that I will be giving the money to my son's friend. She barely even recognized his friend and was confused and said that my nephew deserves this money since he's family. My mom agreed that I wasn't thinking straight and that I should help the people close to me-family and that my nephew has a right to go to college and I was wrong for giving this ""opportunity"" away to someone else.

I didn't know what to say they kept pointing out that I was making a mistake and how my nephew will resent me if he finds out. Thing is my nephew wasn't close to my son I don't even know why he'd be bothered. My sister went on about not being able to afford my nephew's college I told her this was my decision and I felt more comfortable that way. She started lashing out, constantly texting me constantly wanting to talk to me and ending up arguing. When I snapped she had my mom calling me basically guilttripping me and telling me I'm wrong and that I needed to think about this.

I (27F) have a very strained relationship with her but because my mom's side of the family demands that we all remain close-knit, so I have no choice to tolerate her.

When she initially gave birth to them, she teased me that I'll have to take on babysitting duty from now on. I'm no good with kids, so I remarked to her that if I ever have them, I'll train them, not babysit. She brushed me off.

The kids now are hella destructive and loud. Pulling out stuffing inside furniture, holes inside walls, smashing anything glass and porcelain, screaming louder than a fire alarm, you name it. When it was my first turn to deal with them, I immediately walked with them to the store and grabbed the biggest bag of M&M's I could find and trained them so that every time they follow my orders and behave, they get one. If they misbehave, I get one.

Soon enough, every time the kids were dumped on me, they went with my guidelines and behaved. Whenever I say sit, they sit at the table. When I say stay, they don't leave that spot, etc.

Two days ago there was a party planned with the whole extended family (I know, pandemic. Didn't want to, but mom insisted) and I grabbed the M&M's since the twins were there. Arrived, twins were being so destructive (an entire tray of food was spilled) that all the adults had enough and yelled at Amy to control them. She vomited the same excuse of them just being kids and they'll grow out of it eventually.

I shouted the twins' names and shook my M&M bag. They came running over to me and I popped 6  pieces into my mouth for their misbehavior. I told them to go clean up the mess or no candy all night. They do so.

Halfway through the party, every time something similar came up or they just weren't behaving, I was the one able to calm them down. When Amy saw what I was doing, she got angry and started yelling at me about how her children aren't animals and that I shouldn't be giving them so much candy anyway. I told her that I'm their aunt, not their parent, why am I the one disciplining them? Isn't that her job?

She screamed the same argument at me and since she's their mother, to stop giving them candy. One of the twins overheard and went apeshit. Dashed straight into the kitchen and started shattering anything they can get his hands on, shouting over and over that he wants candy. His twin joined him soon after. 

I repeated that she's their mother, and just sat in the living room watching it all unfold. At the end, Amy blamed me for them turning out this way. The other relatives she dumped them on (a majority) disagreed, but when I told a friend about the situation, he told me that the training I did can really fuck up the kids mentally later in life. 

So, AITA?",2020-11-17 00:02:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jvie9q/aita_for_keeping_my_promise_of_training_her_kids/,2392,22122,0.95,92
358,NTA,AITA for telling my husband that defending another woman against me is disrespectful?,"Obligatory, this happened last month but I'm still pretty irritated about it. Not sure if that's the best word for what I actually feel but oh well. Betrayed, I guess.

So.. I got into some pretty childish social media drama last month. It was nothing that I personally started. I had commented on a friends post who had just had a break up and was just offering support. Well, some woman that I dont know and have never heard of messaged me in response to my comment saying ""Dont give out relationship advice when your own relationship is trash."" Or something to that affect. Like I said, I had no idea who this woman was. So, all I responded with was ""Who are you and what are you even talking about? My relationship is great and I wasnt forcing advice onto anyone."" She never responded.

So, I show my husband the message and he immediately gets weird. Apparently he knows this woman from years ago and she is a ""really nice person"" so ""someone must have hacked her account because she would never be mean or rude"". The thing is, he only hung out with her twice, nearly 12 years ago and spoke to her once online since that point so he truly does not know this woman at all.

So I simply asked him why he was trying to defend a woman who had reached out to ME being nasty instead of defending and taking my back. His response was ""I just dont think that it's her. I really dont."" He then messaged her himself and asked her if it was her and she said ""You know me just about well enough to know that I wouldnt say that. My son was using my phone. It was probably him."" Her son is 9 (I creeped), so I call bullshit. 

Anyways, he continued defending her. So I told him that it was extremely disrespectful to me that he is defending this woman and turning his back on me when I had done no wrong. He says I'm an AH for not dropping it and that she said it wasnt her so it wasnt. He also said ""Just because I married you doesnt mean that I cant defend another woman. I dont always have to agree with you."" Which was not the point I was trying to get at, obviously.

AITA?

To include: it reeks of affair, I know. But the woman lives 6 states over so that's impossible.

UPDATE: his work tablet just pinged and her chat head just popped up. Apparently she saw this post. He has responded to her and they are still talking. I will update with the conversation in a second. So far, he has my back.",2020-11-25 15:29:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k0u6ik/aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_defending/,1723,12104,0.96,35
359,NTA,"AITA if I tell my boyfriend not to refer to and introduce me as his ""wife""?","My (30F) bf (33M) have been together for over 5 years & have a 1-year-old son together. We've been homeless together, lost a baby together and slowly built our lives back up. He never liked the idea of marriage, saying, ""I don't see why the gov't has to be involved & why we should have to prove our love to anyone."" I get it, but marriage/a proposal are very important to me. He said he'd marry me because he plans on being with me indefinitely anyway & because he thinks it'd be good for our son. During my pregnancy he mentioned several times that he wanted to get married before our son was born. I waited but never got a proposal or anything. 

Last month was our 5 year anniversary & I thought it'd be great to get married that day. I was heartbroken he still never proposed, especially because he proposed to his last gf before me with a ring & everything. I let the idea of a romantic proposal go & reminded myself that marrying him was the most important part. He said if we could pull it off he was fine with it. He wanted nothing to do with setting it up, which was okay with me. Even for our baby shower he said he didn't want to hear about it, so a family friend & I took care of it ourselves. I changed my schedule at work, picked a location, time, 2 witnesses & someone ordained to officiate  (it was meant to be a small ceremony just to sign the license to make it legal). I ran some of the details by him throughout planning & he kept agreeing they were fine.

2 days before the wedding, the day I planned to go get the license, he said he felt ""forced & pushed into getting married"" & didn't like the idea of doing it now. So I had to cancel everything & explain to everyone at work when they asked how the wedding went. It was so pathetic & humiliating. I went into a major depressive episode & didn't even think we would be together much longer. He said he'd definitely marry me eventually but not now. I told him after what happened I would NEVER bring up marriage to him again. His response was, ""Okay, great! That's awesome!"" (not sarcastic at all, just completely relieved & happy). But I also told him that I wouldn't just be his gf forever. He didn't seem bothered by that, he was just happy I'd shut the fuck up about getting married to him.

He recently introduced me to someone as, ""This is my wife, Alicia"". It felt like a slap in the fucking face. He'd referred to me as his wife occasionally throughout the years before the wedding fiasco, but the fact that he still today calls me his wife really upsets me, because he fucked off that chance when he had it. Would I be the asshole if I told him I don't appreciate being called his wife after everything that happened & to not refer to me as such? I wanna make sure I'm not in the wrong before I bring it up & potentially cause an argument over it.",2020-11-24 01:41:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jzvhxi/aita_if_i_tell_my_boyfriend_not_to_refer_to_and/,1589,15771,0.97,25
360,NTA,AITA for demanding my colleagues use my “offensive” name?,"Throwaway because I am a lurker and don’t have an actual Reddit account.

So, I work for an international company with many different nationalities, recently I have been assigned to a mainly American team (which means I have to work weird hours due to time zones but I’m a single guy with no kids so I can work around that). I live/work in Germany and prior to this team I only used English in writing and spoke German with everyone.

We had a couple of virtual meetings and I noticed some of the Americans mispronouncing my name - they called me Mr. Birch. So I corrected them, my surname is Bič (Czech noun meaning “a whip”, happens to be pronounced just like “bitch”). My name is not English and doesn’t have English meaning. Well, turns out the Americans felt extremely awkward about calling me Mr Bitch and using first names is not a norm here. HR got in touch with me and I just stated that I don’t see a problem with my name (and I don’t feel insulted by being called “Mr Bitch”), I mean, the German word for customer sounds like “cunt” in Czech, it’s just how it is.

Well apparently the American group I’m working with is demanding a different representative (they also work from home and feel uncomfortable saying “curse words”(my name) in front of their families), but due to the time zone issues the German office is having problems finding a replacement for me, nobody wants to work a 2am-7am office shift from home. So management approached me asking to just accept being called Mr Birch but honestly I am a bit offended. A coworker even suggested that I have grounds for discrimination complaint.

Am I the asshole for refusing to answer to a different name?

Edit due to common question: using first names is not our company policy due to different cultural customs, for many (me included) using first names with very distant coworkers is not comfortable and the management ruled that using surnames and titles is much more suitable for professional environment. I am aware that using first names is common in the USA, please mind that while the company is international, the US office is just one of the branches.

Edit 2: many people are telling me to suck it up and change my name or the pronunciation, because many American immigrants did that. So I just want to remind you: I am not an immigrant. I do not live in the US nor do I intend to. I deal with 10ish Americans in video calls and a few dozen in email communication. Then I also deal with hundreds of others at my job - French, Indian, Japanese, Russian... I live in Germany and am from Czech Republic. I know this is a shock for some but really, Americans are a minority in this story.

Edit 3: I deal with other teams as well, everyone calls me Mr Bič, having one single team call me by my first name (which is impolite) or by changing my name is troublesome because things like Birch really do sound different. Someone mentioned Beach, which still sounds odd but it’s better than Birch. Right now I have three options as last resort, if they absolutely cannot speak my name and if German office doesn’t re-assign me: 1. use beach, 2. use Mr Representative, 3. switch to German, which is our office’s official language. Nobody has issues with Bič when speaking German. (Yeah the last option is kind of silly, I know for a fact not everyone in the team speaks German and we would still use English in writing)

Edit4: last edit. Dear Americans, I know you use first names in business/work environment. Please please please understand that the rest of the world is not America. Simply using English for convenience sake does not mean we have to follow specific American customs.",2020-11-11 12:28:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/js79dt/aita_for_demanding_my_colleagues_use_my_offensive/,3278,22332,0.96,30
361,NTA,AITA for denying my parents access to my room while changing?,"So I know it sounds weird but let me explain.
Due to corona I had to move from campus to my parents house again.
Since I moved back I started to have a mayor argument with my parents.
My parents often come into my room due to various reasons ( I feel like they are looking for reasons to come into my room), since it started annoying me, I started to lock my door to ensure my privacy.
So one day I was changing in my room after a shower and my mother wanted to come into my room, I told her to wait because I was changing and she got mad because she wanted to come in now.
I told her I don’t want her to see me while changing and that she has to wait.
She got mad at me for this because she thinks it’s disrespectful towards our relationship.
When I told her I simply don’t want anybody to watch me changing, she called me a Hypokrit because I have pictures in my bikini on my Instagram.
When I said these are two different things, because in that one scenario I „want“ to be seen and I’m giving my consent to the viewer and in the other I’m trying to be alone and I don’t want to be seen. she simply said it’s her house and her rules and if I want to continue living with them my door has to be unlocked all the time.
I simply told her I rather move out again and try to pay for my own place than to continue living with someone that doesn’t value my privacy.
She thinks I’m dramatic and overreacting and damaging our relationship due to something so „minor“ but I really feel devalued in my privacy.",2020-11-25 15:36:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k0ubhw/aita_for_denying_my_parents_access_to_my_room/,1266,16323,0.95,53
362,NTA,AITA: I asked my trans daughter to choose an Indian name,"My husband and I come from a traditional Indian family (immigrated to the US for college and stayed here), so please bear in mind that we really don't know much about all the nuances of the LGBTQ+ community, since we were never really exposed to that. I decided to bring my situation here so I can get some third-party advice.

My ""son"" (now daughter) (15f) recently came out as a transgender girl. We immediately accepted her, told her we loved her no matter what. I got her talking to a gender specialist/therapist, we entered family therapy and my husband and I have spent a lot of time reading and educating ourselves on what it means to be trans. Unfortunately, my husband and I also lost a lot of friends and family who decided that my daughter was a freak and that we were abandoning our culture and values. While we realize that we are better off without these ignorant people, it has been tough, despite having my siblings, some close friends and my husband stand by me. So, several months ago, I joined a support group for parents of kids who are trans. It has been really helpful, and I feel like it is a great place for me to voice my concerns and also express my feelings.

A week ago, my daughter brought up how she probably wanted to change her name; right now, we are calling her a gender neutral nickname of her dead name (think Vikrant to Vicky). I completely understand that having remnants of your dead name can be very bad, so we told her that we would support her in her name-changing process. I also mentioned that I had a list of girl names that I never got use (I have three biological boys), and I would love if she wanted to use those names and if my husband and I, still got to name her. We even offered to do a redo of her traditional Hindu naming ceremony with her new name, which she loved. She said she would think about the names. She mentioned having a ""white"" name (like Samantha) and asked me what I thought. I told her that it was her choice, but I would love if she chose an Indian name, so she always has a piece of her heritage with her and that would make us happy. She said she hadn't thought of that and she'll come up with some names later.

I mentioned this in our support group, and one white mom got really angry at me. She started saying that I was a bad mom who was forcing my daughter to pick a name I wanted and forcing her to embrace a culture that rejected her. She brought up my estranged parents, who I had talked about in previous sessions, and how I was trying to force my daughter to be more like them. That was not my intention, but I feel terrible now and can't stop crying.

363,NTA,AITA for insisting on going to a non-vegan friendly restaurant on my bday that would exclude my vegan husband?,"So my birthday is in 2 weeks. There’s been one thing I really wanted to do this year and that’s go to this amazing restaurant in our city for lunch one day. It’s a two Michelin star place, super fancy, and super duper hard to get lunch reservations specifically on weekends. 

Anyways I called about a week ago for reservations. They said weekends were usually full but since I told them it would be my birthday, they managed to find me a small two person table for the occasion, on my exact birthday. 

I told my husband that I was planning on going but this restaurant is not vegan friendly for their weekend lunches. It’s a multi-course seasonal prix fixe menu only, no a la carte, no vegan/vegetarian alternative. He got upset at this, because he’s vegan and we’ve always made it a priority to eat at only vegan-friendly places. I was blunt and said I just wanted to try this place in particular and was planning on going by myself, no pressure on him going at all.

Since then he’s been mad and sad and everything in between. He’s upset I’ll be spending part of my birthday day by myself even though I assured him it’s only a 2 hour max thing. Then he said it’s selfish of me to choose one of the only restaurants without any vegan options, as it seems I’m trying to exclude him intentionally on a special day. So now I feel really guilty and am questioning if it’s even worth all this drama. AITA for still wanting to go?

**Edit**: just woke up to overwhelming responses! Addressing a few more things here:

1) I’m going by myself, so I’m not making him sit and watch me eat! We have plans for a very casual vegan-friendly dinner that same night to celebrate, so the lunch isn’t the only meal for the day. 

2) I called honestly not expecting to get a table, I was just curious and wanted to know the wait. The restaurant is operating a half-capacity I believe because the tables are all spaced out and you can’t have more than a few people at each. They offered me a small corner table meant for 2, but it’ll just be me. It’s probably not a “prime” location but I don’t care! 

3) I’m not in the US, restaurants are still operating normally here (but with restrictions), and we don’t have a huge runaway covid issue here. If I were in the US and some other places right now, I would not be considering restaurant meals so I recognize we’ve been luckier than most.

4) I’d love to share with everyone the restaurant name and menu but I’m a little paranoid about drawing negative attention to them and getting this blasted across the internet. I’m not trying to get between any pro-vegan/anti-vegan internet war. Anyways I’ve DMed the website/menu to a few people already and will probably message a few more people that are interested!

5) My husband is pretty great normally so I think he’s probably just slightly taken aback I’ve chosen the restaurant I have. He’s not much of a foodie type and I usually go along with his terms when choosing restaurants so I don’t think he expected me to want fine dining as a bday present for myself! I will definitely talk to him more and try to express my feelings better so we reach an understanding. I will probably go ahead and eat there though regardless!",2020-11-24 14:37:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k063yx/aita_for_insisting_on_going_to_a_nonvegan/,1725,9516,0.96,12
364,NTA,AITA for refusing to pay a dime for the medical bills of the teenager I technically hit with my car?,"Last year, I was driving home from work on a four lane road that had a divider in the middle. It’s dangerous to cross against the light because the speed limit is 45, but people do anyway. I saw a group of teens standing on the divider, waiting to cross my lane, but figured they were waiting for the light to change so they had the right of way before they crossed. Well, they didn’t, and one kid walked right in front of my car. I slammed on the brakes but couldn’t swerve because there were cars in the lane next to me. 

He was pretty seriously injured, but survived, and from the most recent info I have he has regained full mobility but continues to deal with some cognitive issues. I blamed myself for a long time and spent several months in therapy over the guilt. But overall the accident was not at all my fault; by the laws of physics I could not have stopped in time, I was obeying all traffic laws, and he knowingly walked directly into multiple lanes of oncoming traffic against the light. Apparently he said he assumed I would stop for him. But if I hadn't hit him, a car in the lane next to me absolutely would have.

My insurance company defended me in the multiple lawsuits from his parents health insurance company and the ones his parents filed against me personally, and I was ruled not at fault every time. But unsurprisingly his parents are now seriously struggling to pay off his medical bills, and think I should be paying most or all of it. According to the GoFundMe, they have well over six figures of bills, will be losing their house, and one of the parents is out of work now. I’ve been contacted by no less than 20 people insisting that since I “hit him with my car”, I have a moral obligation to help pay. 

My issue: my husband and I both lost close relatives to what’s going around, and received modest inheritances we were not expecting. So technically, we do now have the money to help (without it we wouldn’t be able to make any meaningful dent in the debt). Our plan had been to use that to pay for IVF to start a family, and potentially adoption if that's how it goes. But now, with so many friends/family members of the boy reaching out to my husband directly about the GoFundMe too, my husband says he feels “morally conflicted” using that money to, in his words “create a whole new kid when one is already in need”. He wants to give the money to the boy’s parents to help pay off their debt, and is now even talking about the “payment plan” they want me to agree to. 

I understand that technically I hit a kid with my car, but under the circumstances I don’t think I should have to sacrifice having my own kid because of his carelessness. My husband (and the legion of people harassing me) says it’s cruel to refuse to pay a dime. I think helping even a token amount will open the floodgates, and I don’t feel bad about refusing. Should I? My husband is someone I see as a really reasonably person, so he’s making me second guess my feelings.",2020-11-20 18:42:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jxutpc/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_a_dime_for_the_medical/,2009,12107,0.96,17
365,NTA,AITA for telling my sister and parents that she can never live with me?,"To start with I (26f) have never had a good relationship with my sister (32f). She didn't like having a younger sibling and had no interest in me. She moved out when she was 18 and ceased any contact with me, even going as far as rubbing it in my face how she never wanted to know me, by showing up for Christmas at grandparents houses and bringing gifts for our cousins but not me, and by showing up for their birthdays but not mine. The last time I was any way hopeful for us to have a relationship was at our youngest cousins 1st birthday party when I was 15. She brought along her friends and was mocking me for trying to talk to her when I saw her earlier at the party. So I hardened toward her that day and decided if she didn't want to be my sister then I would just need to accept that and move on from her.

She got married when I was 17 and told our parents I was not welcome. Our parents tried to change her mind but she was not having it. I thought that was when they realized there was no way we were going to be buddies some day or even real family.

And now they expect me to help her out. She got divorced from her husband four years ago, he got her into a lot of debt and then bailed. They have a 7 year old together. She lost her job recently and she got a new job in my city and then the rental she had planned to move into fell through and she ended up asking me to stay. I told her no. She went to our parents and the three put pressure on me. When I stood by my stance they paid for her to stay in a hotel for a while...

She has not been able to secure a place and apparently lost the job due to a lack of actual address.

They are all saying I turned my back on her and we should help family. I got really frustrated with all of them but especially my parents. She has NEVER wanted a single thing to do to me. She has purposely gone out of her way to hurt my feelings and make it clear I am nothing to her. But I'm supposed to help her out because she's a struggling single mom? After everything? With no apology or actual sign that she doesn't feel the same about me.

Where my guilt is coming in to ask this is she has a daughter and I feel bad for her. But her daughter is also a stranger to me. I have never been part of her life and I don't even know if she knows who I am. But still, she's a kid and as a mom now I am wondering if I am being a total dick here like they seem to believe.

AITA?

Fixed the typo about her being the younger sibling. It's that she didn't like having one. Also want to add because it keeps coming up that more could have happened before I was born in the early years that I am not aware of. But all I have ever been told is she reacted negatively to having a sibling and that's all I've ever known from her. I can't say I know of anything that could have caused it.",2020-11-20 10:32:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jxmrg0/aita_for_telling_my_sister_and_parents_that_she/,1696,18830,0.95,49

I visited her at work recently and this friend began telling me that we should have an open relationship and I’m holding my fiancée back. I mostly laughed it off at first and told her I wasn’t comfortable with that kind of relationship. She kept pushing so I told her, “ Can you fuck off? I barely even know your name lady. Your opinion does not matter to me.” 

She got mad and called me an asshole. My fiancée was mad I treated her friend that way because, “she was joking.” 
Am I the asshole for getting mad?

Edit: one common question is why doesn’t the friend get with him. She did, from what I have been told she is a very promiscuous girl.

367,NTA,AITA for not leashing my dogs on MY property to accommodate someone who was trespassing?,"On mobile. Sorry for any formatting issues.

I live in a fairly remote area that attracts a lot of tourists due to a nearby popular hiking trail. My place has 4 units. Two are Airbnb type rentals and two are permanent residences. Mine is one of the permanent ones. We have a lot of problems with tourists using our parking for turning around, looking up directions, or just trying to park and leave their cars while they go hike. There is a large parking area for tourists by the trailhead. Our parking area is a large, open area. This is private property and there are signs posted.

I have 3 friendly dogs and the other permanent resident has 2. We very rarely leash any of them. We just let the out and supervise their running and playing. I will leash them if on of the Airbnb guests has an issue with dogs.

So I go to let my dogs out this afternoon and there is someone out in our parking area, messing with his snow chains. He has a kid (around 9-10 years old) with him.

Me (M): Are you visiting someone here?

I get no response, so I ask again. Still no response. So I start playing frisbee with one of my dogs.

Tourist (T): Can you please leash your dogs? We are afraid.

M: Are you visiting someone here?

T: No, I’m just stopped to take the chains off.

M: Then, no, I’m not leashing my dogs.

T: We are afraid of dogs.

M: This is MY home. My dogs are on my private property.

Tourist gives me a dirty look but doesn’t say anything. He finishes taking his snow chains off and is getting ready to leave.

T (with a rude tone): I’m sorry I asked you to leash your dogs. We’re just allergic and afraid.

M: You are on private property and are  trespassing. My dogs have a right to be here, on their property. Maybe you should have thought about that before saying something.

He didn’t say anything else and left a few minutes later.

I posted about the incident on my Facebook and someone said I was rude for not accommodating. I think I’m in the right because it’s my property and this guy had no right to be here and was trespassing. So, users of Reddit, AITA?

Edit to add a few things.
Info: 1. The local laws are that dogs must be “under control” at all times, meaning leashed, tethered, fenced, or voice commands. My dogs are all trained to obey voice commands. 2. Public parking areas are available less than half a mile in either direction. 3. He was fully in my driveway with room to put at least 2 vehicles between him and the entrance.

Also, I could and would have been nicer if I hadn’t asked him twice if he was visiting and been ignored. It wasn’t clear what he was doing when I first went out because he was standing next to his car. I didn’t get really close because I am female and was concerned for my own safety.

368,NTA,AITA for telling my ex-wife to F-off and not allowing her to talk to our kids?,"PLEASE READ BEFORE MAKING A DECISION. 

I have five kids with my now ex-wife, (7F), (5F), (2M and 2M), and a seven month old baby boy. When my ex was pregnant with the baby, she decided that she didn't want to be involved with me or the kids anymore, so she divorced me and signed all her rights away. The only reason that I know she's still alive is the child support checks that I get. 

My kids are obviously still upset over their mum just getting up and leaving without even giving them a heartfelt goodbye. My oldest has expressed being cross towards me regarding the situation, since she's the only one that truly understands that her mom probably won't come back. She feels abandoned and has come to me crying, because she believes that her mum doesn't love her anymore. My other daughter still believes that her mum's gonna come back, and it really hurts to hear her ask when she'll be back. 

My other kids, obviously, don't understand where their mum has gone. All I can truly get from them is tears, and asking where their mum has went. 

Just to be clear, I don't badmouth their mother, or say bad things in general about her to them. 

Yesterday, my ex called. I only picked up because I didn't recognize the number. She said hello, and asked if she could speak to the kids. I said no, mostly because I didn't know how they would react. She said that she missed them terribly, and because of COVID, couldn't see them, and she really wanted to hear their voices. 

I said that I wasn't comfortable with that. I told her that I would talk to my oldest two later on, and ask if they wanted to speak to her, but for now, I wouldn't allow it. She said that she was still their mum, and that she had the right to speak to them. I said that she lost any right to them when she signed those rights away. 

At this point, my wife raised her voice, and said that I was keeping her away from the people she loved most. I said that I didn't give care about her feelings, that she abandoned the kids, and to F-off like she did months ago before hanging up. 
My kids weren't in ear shot, just to be clear. 

I'm not proud of losing my temper, because I'm not that kind of guy. But I was at my wit's end, and couldn't take it anymore. 

I still have my mother-in-law as one of my contacts because I don't have anybody else to care for the kids if something happens to me. All night, she's been blowing up my phone, saying that my ex-wife is still a mother, and has a right to talk to her kids. 

I don't know. I'm tired. Honest opinions?",2020-11-23 01:44:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jz8b6z/aita_for_telling_my_exwife_to_foff_and_not/,1531,13358,0.95,54
369,NTA,AITA for calling my wife lazy and a terrible mother?,"
This is my first time posting so excuse me for any mistakes I make. I’m a 57 year old male, and my wife is 51 year old female, we’ve been married for 28 years and have one son together that is 25. She’s a stay at home wife, she never worked a day after we got married since I inherited a company that had been in my family for many generations so money was never a problem and we lived more than comfortably. 

When our son was little she took care of him and the house. Now that he’s an adult the chores are the only thing that she does, she used to take on writing but gave up because she said that it’s not as easy as she thought. Now I don’t consider myself sexist or that woman belongs in the house with kids, this was her choice because she never liked to work. The problem is I work long hours and expect to at least have a dinner after the long day.

We have a housekeeper that comes over twice a week so her responsibilities are basically cooking and smaller chores. She stopped cooking and doing things lately because she doesn’t feel like doing it. She spends her days hanging with her friends and shopping. Also our son was born as a female and my wife always wanted a daughter, when he came out as trans she threw a fit and was unsupportive, I paid for his  surgery and he transitioned, she was never as caring towards him as before and uses wring pronounces and his old name all the time.

The other day I came home and she didn’t do anything whole day and I snapped, I told her that I’m sick of her not doing anything while I’m providing for our family ( My son is also still in college, and I pay for all of his expenses and apartment because I want him to focus on school). The argument went on and she decided to throw in my face how it’s my fault she lost her daughter. This really socked me and I told her that she is lazy and also a terrible mother for talking as if her child is dead when we have a perfect and healthy son.

I am at lost, half of family members are siding with her half with me ( including our son), she called me an asshole and went to stay with her sister. Was I the asshole? I’m seriously considering divorce.

Edit: thank you for everyone commenting I just wanted to clear up that my son has been out since he was 14 and had his surgery 5 years ago.

Another edit: few of you questioned my son siding with his mom, I don’t know how you got that but my son is definitely on my side (even tho he doesn’t know the full story).",2020-11-17 17:22:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jvx2b5/aita_for_calling_my_wife_lazy_and_a_terrible/,1923,20056,0.93,95
370,NTA,AITA: For walking out in the middle of thanksgiving dinner after my brother in law announced my sister's pregnancy?,"
I 36F went through an incredibly hard time losing my baby while I was 5 months pregnant with him. This has affected me both physically and emotionally. I don't have kids and my husband and I have been struggling for a long time trying to have kids. My sister has been supportive of me, she's 7 years younger than me and has been married to her husband for two years now. She visited me several times to see how I was doing. Her husband however seems to have an issue with me personally. He's always been treating me poorly and acting like he's somehow superior to me and my husband, my husband doesn't see my family much so this wasn't an issue especially when my brother in law comes over.

My husband and I were invited to thanksgiving dinner at my mom's house. We got there a bit late because I was taking care of some tests at the hospital that needed to be done so that my doctor could see them the next day. We sat at the table my aunt was present she lives alone so she always visits and casually talked about several things. I noticed my sister and my brother in law were whispering something to each other and at some point I heard my sister tell her husband to knock it off. We were confused we had no idea what was going next thing I knew my brother in law got up from his seat and announced that they were expecting.

I looked at my husband and he was shocked but not because of the news but the way it was given. My sister hid her face in her hands and did nothing else except that. It took me time to process this while my aunt got up and started hugging and congratulating my sister. I don't know what suddenly happened to me my heart started pounding and my husband was already gone to the bathroom to wash up. I just gathered my things and took my purse then told them to finish their dinner then I walked out. My sister was sitting there the entire time and just watched me and my husband walk out while my mom was trying to convince me to stay for a little longer.

I felt absolutely horrible. I only lost my baby two weeks ago and for me to be taken off guard like that is just horrible. I got no calls nor texts from my sister wanting to talk, nothing but my aunt called me to tell me what I did was totally inappropriate and that I should've stayed and congratulated my sister and her husband. Even berated my husband for not reacting differently. I argued with her that my brother in law did it purposely and that he could've picked a better time but instead chose to spite me and my husband while still grieving our baby. My aunt still thinks I should've acted in adult way and not walk out on dinner like that.",2020-11-27 18:46:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k2719g/aita_for_walking_out_in_the_middle_of/,1182,11571,0.94,32
371,NTA,"AITA for ""offending"" someone who assumed I was trans?","I (25F) recently started a new job. During the whole application and interview process I communicated with the same person, the office manager ""Susan"". We had a couple of messages on email and she conducted my Zoom interview. I got my job offer a couple of weeks ago, and have been WFH for the company ever since.

At the end of last week, I had an email arrive from someone representing the company's LGBTQ group (this was the national group representing my company, I work for them in a regional capacity), saying that I had a standing invitation to join them in their next Zoom chat, if only to meet other LGBTQ people at the company and have a conversation with them. I am a cis heterosexual woman. I replied saying that while I'd love to join them as an ally, there had been some kind of miscommunication, as I'm not LGBTQ. I got a quick response to that apologising, saying that my name had been passed onto them as a new transgender employee. The only time I've discussed sexuality has been on the anonymous equal opportunities form that I submitted alongside my initial application, which stated that I was straight and cis.

A couple of hours after that, I got called to an emergency meeting with Susan. When I entered the call she practically screamed at me that I'd misled her. I asked how, and she said that she and the entire hiring team had assumed that I was transgender because of the fact that I put my pronouns into my email signature. If anything, I do this because it will make whoever I'm communicating with feel sure in the pronouns that I use, and saves them from having to ask (which is something that I believe should be commonplace, but that's just me). I reiterated this to Susan, and said that I'd never tried to mislead anyone. She said that she'd only seen trans people feel the need to mention their pronouns before, and that when my face appeared on the Zoom interview it ""could've realistically been a trans woman"", so she continued on with her assumption. She also hinted at the fact that my supposed gender identity had resulted in a big swing in my favour over other candidates, and some of the hiring team now feel like I should be ""let go"" as I wasn't the best applicant on skill alone. I've double checked since, and while the company can fire me without cause for the next year or so, since a protected category (sex) has been identified as a potential factor, I'd have recourse to challenge them on that if they were to terminate my contract in the very next future (because while you can't fire someone based on their gender identity, you also can't hire someone solely based on your perception of it either). She ended the call by saying that this wouldn't be going any further right now, but on behalf of the trans employees at the company, she was very offended at my ""choices"".

I'm not going to ask about if I should stay in the job (not the right sub and also I barely have to talk to Susan now, so hopefully the drama will just die down), but was I wrong for immediately presenting myself in a way that could lead someone to assume that I was transgender?

Edit: Thank you to everyone for responding. I have realised that this is a greater issue than just this instance, and will be following the advice to create a paper trail to document this further before taking my next steps. On another note, if you're going to take the time to message me calling me fake and both a SJW *and* a TERF (I mean why??) then please know I'm not going to waste any energy on you. Also, if a username has ""throw"" in it, I'm not going to take the time and word count up explaining the exact reasons I'm using a throwaway.

&#x200B;

I live in a not so well off area. I am not well of by any means, but I have a wifi connection. My wifi has a 4 device limit, its the cheapest plan they have. My neighbours have a 12 year old daughter who has to attend online classes, I know her well because she comes over fairly often to hang out with my daughter as they are friends. Her name is Shanaya. Shanaya's parents told her they cannot afford wifi, so she asked me if she can use mine. I agreed, and said the only condition was that she has to study hella hard and do her best. She agreed and has been using it for a while. Over the past 2 months, I have been finding it hard to use my wifi. The web portal for the wifi says 4 devices are constantly connected to it when all I am using is my phone and my daughter is using her laptop. Sometimes, my daughter can't connect to her own classes and uses data.

I asked Shanaya about it last week, and she said her parents forced her to tell them the password and that they have been using it. I went and spoke to her parents about it, and said that it is only for her to be able to attend classes. They said they will stop using it. But over the week, 4 times my daughters classes got interrupted because there were multiple devices trying to use it. Yesterday, Shanaya told me that our other neighbors also have the password and are also using it, that her parents gave it to them. I went and warned her parents again, said I will change the password, but they made false promises again and shut their door. I changed the password and gave shanaya the new one, but her parents forced it out of her again.

My daughters education needs to take priority, her classes are important. I can't let her education take a backseat, but if I change it again and not give shanaya the password, her education will get affected. WIBTA if I change the password and not tell Shanaya?

373,NTA,AITA for telling my sister I am never babysitting or being childcare for her and her husband again?,"My (29f) sister (32f) asked me if I could babysit Thursday and Friday afternoon's after school for her and her husband while they work. I said sure, no problem. I love my niece and nephew and I love spending time with them. It was also a nice way to get to know her husbands two kids better when they had them. It has worked great for three years I have been doing it. Then I started doing an occasional Saturday night for their date nights.

For a while I have had some issues with her husband. There were nights he didn't have his kids from a previous relationship but he wanted me to babysit as well and I never felt comfortable with this. When it is his parenting time absolutely no problem. But I know his ex from a past job and I do not want to get involved with her level of crazy which babysitting on her parenting time could potentially bring to my door. My sister and I talked about this before and she got him to back off for the most part. Because of this I was happy to continue.

So last Saturday I was supposed to babysit for them to have a kid free night after months of craziness due to Covid. My sisters husband shows up with all the kids (because it was their parenting time) AND his ex's younger child and her boyfriends kids. Nobody said anything to me. I never agreed to have all those kids and at the door he acted like an ass because I told him I was not babysitting all those kids.

I called my sister and she said she had no idea he would do that. I told her that I am tired of him pushing and that last night crossed a line for me and I am not willing to subject myself to the pressure again. Not to mention it made me feel like an ass having to deal with it while all the kids were standing there. Some of whom I had never laid eyes on before.

My sister is understandably hurt but said she understands. Her husband is telling me I'm an asshole for dropping out of things on such short notice.

374,NTA,AITA for not wanting to get rid of the anime body pillow that saved my marriage?,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

My husband and I are best friends during the day. Love of my life. It's at night that's an issue. I'm a blanket stealer. I once yanked them so hard poor Hubby flipped a full 180. Hubby, for his part, is a thrasher. Bruce Lee would be jealous of the moves he pulls off while unconscious. It's a constant war between us when we fall asleep, and both of us often wake up sore and exhausted. It was starting to affect our relationship. Neither of us wanted to move to a separate bed because we like spending our nights together, but it seemed like an inevitability. We were both crabby every morning, and we started fighting as soon as we got up. It sucked, but neither of us wanted to concede defeat and move to the other bed.

Quick background: I was a huge nerd as a teenager. Full on otaku (go ahead, cringe, I do too). One night as a joke, I brought down an old anime body pillow from the attic (I know, the cringe) and plopped it down between my husband and I, declaring it our demilitarized zone. Hubby also thought it was hilarious, and we named her DMZ-chan. She stayed there the whole night.

It was a game changer. DMZ-chan protected me from Hubby's REM-induced rampages, and she's just heavy enough that I can't yank the blankets at full speed. DMZ-chan is now a beloved part of our nightly routine. We both thought it was the funniest thing, but she legitimately helped us solve the only real issue in our marriage.

One day, MIL stopped by to pick something up. She got up to use the restroom, passing by our open bedroom door. You can guess what she saw. DMZ-chan, propped up in the middle of our bed, her giant soulful anime eyes looking right back at MIL. When she got back, she quickly grabbed her stuff and left, Hubby and I both confused. She later mentioned DMZ-chan to Hubby while they were on the phone, and it absolutely mortified him. As far as I know, MIL now thinks we're deviants in a three-way relationship with a body pillow. Hubby was too embarrassed to explain, and now he wants to put DMZ-chan back in the attic.

I was upset. I told him I didn't want to go back to boxing each other at night, and that DMZ-chan helped us so much in that. He agreed, but suggested we get a normal, plain body pillow case to replace her. I felt like there was no need to spend money on something we already have, and if it really was that big of an issue, we can put her in the closet while we have company over. Hubby is firm in that she has to go permanently. I know he's embarrassed, but I feel we shouldn't have to compromise our inside jokes to appease other people. AITA?

**Edit:** Sweet bees this blew up. Was not expecting all the attention. Just wanted to say thank you to everyone for chiming in. I admit I was being stubborn; I drove over to Target on my lunch break and bought a new cover for 10 bucks. I put it on DMZ-chan as soon as I got home (to those asking, I did wash her after fishing her out of the attic), and am now waiting on Hubby to get home so I can apologize for making him uncomfortable. DMZ-chan shall live on in our hearts.

If you’ve seen the movie Red Eye, they’re that obnoxious hotel couple. Regardless, they are visiting this week. They came in from out of town which is always stressful for me and my husband. 

My husband and I have a queen bed. We have a twin bed in one bedroom, a full bed in our main guest room. We put my parents for the full. The full bed is not some rickety old thing- it’s maybe five years old?

I was all “o.O?!!” I said no. For me, it’s not just our bed - my parents would absolutely be the type to snoop around our bedroom.

My parents have been complaining off and on all day. They had an extra cup of coffee because they’re so tired. They need Advil because their back is so sore. Stuff like that.

He told me I didnt need a break, that it's easy to do my job. I ended up screaming that the next day, he is tending to the house and kids and that I was locking myself in our room and playing video games all day.

True to my word, I refused to unlock the door saturday or do anything. My MIL called me pissed that I could do that to my family and that I was the AH for ignoring my family to play games. I told her that maybe if she raised her son better, it wouldnt have came to this. My husband is angry, my mil is angry and I feel like the AH.

I love this guy to death but when I say he is lazy, that is seriously a huge fucking understatement and doesnt even shed an ounce of light on the actual problem. Hes also a gaming junkie-like the worst of their kind. For example, when a game is being released, he waits up until midnight to purchase the game (no matter how expensive) and will binge on it for weeks straight while hardly sleeping. During this time you will be lucky to get so much as a ""hello"" out of him without him getting pissed for you disrupting him. BUT still expects people to literally cater to his every need so that he doesnt have to get up to do anything. I dont entertain this because I'm not his fucking mother.

Anyways, a year and a half ago I had to give him an ultimatum. You either get a fucking job and start supporting yourself OR you can leave and go mooch off someone else. He chose to get a job. Lasted a month before he quit. Found another job 2 months later, lasted 2 weeks and quit. He was unemployed for 11 months when he finally landed this job in September. Assassins Creed was just released, what, 2 weeks ago and he started calling out every. single. day. Started staying up until 4am playing his game, would sleep until 8-10am and then be right back at it while asking me to cook and cater to him.

Yesterday I unplugged and hid his xbox. I knew he was going to call out and jump on his game. As I suspected, that's exactly what he tried doing. He picked a fight with me. Said he hated working and I was forcing him to waste away his life. Claimed he was depressed, though that's the first I've heard of it. He then tells me to get off my lazy ass and do something for once. I told him to leave. He takes my car because his is ""on its last leg""- his words. Hes not in work clothes so I know he wasnt going to work. I texted him and said ""If you arent going to work, bring my car back. And if you plan on flaking on this job like the rest of them, you will not be using my car or my internet. Make your choice."" He texted back saying ""You trying to mother me all the time is a fucking turn off. You holding things against me all the time also makes you a fucking asshole.""

It took years but around the time our eldest was born it was finally finished. It's not massive; 5 bedrooms and a small pool in the gardens but it is our paradise. We've always allowed our families and friends to use it whenever they please, and have spent every summer vacation staying there with our children.

Our only stipulation when people stay there is that the master bedroom is off limits. It takes up most of the 3rd floor with the remaining bedrooms on the 2nd floor. A lot of my and my wife's belongings are in there, and it's also the room we have shared together for over twenty years. 

Recently my niece got engaged and held an engagement party on Zoom at the weekend. When asked what ideas they'd had so far she excitedly told me they'd actually been planning to ask us if they could hold the wedding at The Castle.

I was a bit taken aback but didn't want to outright refuse. I joked it would have to be a rather small wedding since they'd struggle to fit more than 25 people in the gardens. She gushed that she'd already thought it through and they'd put up canopies in the field nearby (we don't own that land) and if all the guests stayed in hotels in the town she would arrange transport for ""us all to get to the villa"".

My wife and I bit our tongues not wanting to make a fuss during their engament celebration. But later when my niece texted me to repeat what she'd said I asked her to clarify the sleeping arrangements and after some back and forth it came to light she plans to use the master bedroom as the bridal suite and for the wedding party to have the remaining rooms. My wife, children and I would have to stay elsewhere. 

I slept on my decision and spoke with my wife. On Sunday I responded and politely refused, saying it's too small and we aren't comfortable having anyone in our room. Both she and my sister blew up at me telling me I was ruining her wedding and she'd always dreamed of marrying at The Castle. My sister even said since I used my inheritance it's ""family property"" which is obviously ridiculous. 

ETA When we texted her on Sunday we offered a compromise: no master bedroom, and either get permission/insurances to use the fields, or reduce guest count to 25. We even offered to host a small rehearsal too but she rejected the offers. That is when we outright refused",2020-11-12 01:02:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jskty5/aita_for_not_letting_my_niece_host_her_wedding_at/,2062,24195,0.97,39
380,NTA,Aita for telling my brother he got exactly what he deserved when he pushed his girlfriend away for being a “gold digger”?,"My brother is a very hardworking man and at 27 he is now very wealthy and doing well for himself. He’s been with this girl for six months and throughout the time we have gotten close because we both like hair, makeup, and shopping. I never knew there was anything wrong with their relationship except when she texted me last week I saying she would love to hang out but thinks it’ll be inappropriate because her and my brother broke up. I asked her why and she said she was sick and tired of “auditioning” to prove she was with him for the right reasons. She went on to say that my brother is paranoid she’s after his money so he would test her like 1. Leaving out his bank statements on their bed and getting upset when she picked it up 2. Going out to eat at high end restaurants he requested and leaving his wallet on home at purpose to make her pay the bill and prove she’s not going out with him for money 3. Never buying her gifts and questioning her when she asks why he doesn’t. 



I was shocked so I had to hear my brothers perspective. We spoke and he told me everything she said was true and that there’s nothing wrong with making sure his girlfriend is with him for the right reasons. He said he left his bank statements on the bed and was peeking through the door to see if she would be curious and when he saw her pick up the papers he knew in his gut she was using him for his money, so he set up the restaurant idea to see if she would get upset at paying a 500$ bill which she was. I asked him if he thinks her being an elementary school teacher could’ve contributed to her being upset at a 500$ bill at a restaurant he wanted to go to and he said no. He said the straw that broke was when she asked him why he hasn’t bought her a single gift since they’ve started dating when she bought him a gaming console and new rims for his car and he knew she was just discretely asking him to buy her an expensive gift. 


He confronted her and said he thinks she’s with him for his money so she said let me do us both a favor and dumped him and blocked him. He’s upset about the “gold digging bitch” and when I laughed he called me an asshole. He said I would never understand what’s it’s like being a rich man and being used and I get that concern, but I told him if he thinks any woman will be okay with his tests and auditions he’s delusional as hell. If he doesn’t want to be used for his money he should start dating people as wealthy as him or leave lower income people alone if he’s not going to be genuine in his relationships unless they pass his “test”.",2020-11-02 17:40:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jms4y3/aita_for_telling_my_brother_he_got_exactly_what/,2822,39927,0.95,88
381,NTA,AITA for refusing to give my parents my passwords now that I'm an adult?,"This happened a few months ago and my dad is insistent that I'm the asshole here.

My parents have always been kind of overprotective. Ever since I was old enough to make my first social media accounts, they insisted that they had to have the passwords to them. Being around 11 years old at the time, I agreed. I soon got upset though, since I started noticing messages being sent that weren't typed by me on my account. If my friends swore, my parents would send them a message acting as if they were me, being rude to them and telling them that I didn't want to be friends with them anymore. This caused a lot of fights between me and my friends. Meanwhile, my parents stated that it was for the best.

As I got older, this behaviour just got worse. Around high school, my dad installed security cameras in the house. He said it was for keeping us safe, but honestly, it feels like I'm in prison. The cameras are all in different angles to make sure there are no blind spots. They're placed in the kitchen, living room and all the hallways. None in the bedrooms or bathrooms though. He can check them on his phone along with use them as an intercom system to get upset at me if I'm doing something he doesn't like.

He made me install an App onto my phone that logs where I go, for how long and how I got there. It keeps this information for about a week and notifies him if I turn off my location sharing. He checks it often and then asks me about it almost daily. (ex. ""I saw you went to x's house today. How was that?""

He also keeps a paper in the house with all my usernames and passwords for every social media account I have that they know about. They make me update it yearly and test it before letting me go to make sure that it all works. They say that it's for safety reasons, so that if I go missing or something, they can check who I was talking to.

However, I'm 21 now. I live with them to save money since I'm still a full time university student. Recently, my dad asked me to update the passwords and I told him no, because I would like to have some privacy now. He got extremely upset and used his parental controls on the Wifi to cut my devices from getting connected for a week. I wasn't able to do my homework properly and I couldn't call with friends or anything because I don't have much data in my phone plan.

I got upset with my dad and got into a pretty bad argument with him. He said that he was just protecting me and that as my father it was his job to make sure that he always knew where I was and what I was doing. I tried talking to my mom about this, but she said that I shouldn't keep seeing the both of them as the bad guys and that I would eventually understand. She cried during our conversation and kept telling me how much I hurt my dad by implying that I don't trust him.

I've always been introverted and never go anywhere without telling them. I don't think I need to be surveilled this heavily but I do feel bad for upsetting my mom so much.

AITA?

EDIT: Woah, uh. This blew up overnight. Thank you to everyone who messaged me and gave me advice in here. To be honest, I was a little nervous posting on here because... Idk maybe I thought people would think I was completely in the wrong. I know it's the point here to find out but... Whew. Anyway, some things to clear up: I'm 21F. I forgot to mention that. I don't really mind people using he/him for me in here since they didn't know but I just thought I'd say.

I work part time and I don't pay for rent/utilities/wifi. My parents do ask me for large sums of money every once in a while to pay for stuff around the house (fixing the broken fridge, getting the heater replaced when it died, etc.) I live in Canada so uh, the stuff in Australia and USA doesn't help me but I appreciate it anyway.

I'll try to update you guys in the future. Thank you to everyone for your advice and wishing me good luck.",2020-11-22 21:59:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jz4iu1/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_parents_my_passwords/,1184,11920,0.96,30
382,NTA,AITA for explaining periods to my brother?,"I (15f) have two brothers (17m and 12m). This happened a few days ago, but I really need a second opinion.

I share a bathroom with my brothers, and the other day I accidentally left a box of tampons on the counter instead of putting them away. My younger brother asked me what they were, and I said that they were tampons.

Cue him being very confused, and my older brother and I realising that he knows nothing about any of this stuff. We decided to give him a basic rundown of the female reproductive system and he seemed okay with it.

That night, he mentioned to our parents that we told him about periods and they got pretty upset. My mom said that he's way to young to be knowing about this and that it was inappropriate for us to be telling him. As it turns out, they're planning on opting him out of Sex Ed. at his school in the spring because he's, in their opinion, too young.

I can kind of see where they're coming from, he is their kid after all and I definitely could have just said that the tampons were ""feminine products"". However, this is something he would have to learn at some point and that wasn't going to happen if they didn't let him go to sex ed.

I'm not really sure, did we seriously overstep a boundary here? AITA?

Edit: For those people saying that this is obviously fake because I haven't replied to comments or something, no, I went to bed. I was sleeping. Calm down. 

To answer some questions: My older brother and I did mandatory Sex Ed in 5th grade, but my younger brother's was cancelled due to the state of the world. We also both did Sex Ed in 8th grade. I have no idea why they would opt out only him, but it's probably a youngest child thing.",2020-11-17 07:26:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jvoszp/aita_for_explaining_periods_to_my_brother/,1687,13045,0.96,30
383,NTA,AITA for removing my stalker app after turning 25?,"I (25f) deal with parents, mainly my dad, who are pretty protective over me. At 18, my dad requested that we all download an app that logs your exact location, driving patterns and duration of stays. My mom lives at home, and my older brother is on the spectrum and needs a certain degree of supervision, so they agreed. I gave some pushback as I was an adult and it felt like an invasion of privacy. My dad argued that as I was financially dependent on my parents, I had to do as he said. He also said that he wasn't worried about what *I* would do, but worried about what *other people* would do to me, and if I ever ran into trouble my parents could rescue me. I initially agreed, but referred to it from then on as ""the stalker app"".

Most of the time it wasn't an issue, but sometimes there would be problems. If I let my parents know I would be out at night in one part of town, but ended up in another part of town, I'd get a text to contact dad immediately. If they saw that I was in my dorm after a certain time, I'd get a call to see if I overslept and missed class. This was definitely a bummer when it came planning to meet friends, going out to bars, having hookups...I felt like I had no privacy.

Fast forward to today, I just turned 25 this month and I still have the app on my phone. Except now I work a full-time job, live in Japan, and am completely independent from my parents, new phone and plan included.

I talked with my dad about this again, and now that he can't use money as something to hang over my head, he says it's necessary now more than ever to know where I am because I live in Japan and if something like a huge earthquake were to happen, he and mom need to know if I'm safely evacuated. He argued that if I have nothing to hide, why do I care so much that he knows where I am? While my mom agrees that my dad's fears are unreasonable, she says that only kids would care so much about having their parents not know their whereabouts and that I'm being immature for fighting this so much for so long, and to just let it be.

I decided this week to remove the stalker app and told him. He's not only mad that I'm standing my ground, but he thinks I'm selfish and to compensate, I have to text him everyday from now on. Mom jumps in and says that it's much less work for me to keep the app on my phone, so just let it go. I said that I should never have had this damn app in the first place, and that they're lucky that I had gone along with this for as long as I have. Both parents are mad at me and think I'm being immature, and I just want to know AITA for removing it after this long and am I making a big deal out of nothing?

TLDR; I (25f) have had a location app on my phone since I was 18, and my dad doesn't want me to remove it. I moved overseas and no longer financially rely on parents, so I told my dad I'm removing the app, he's upset, and parents think I'm being selfish for making them worry about me.

384,NTA,AITA for how I handled a student's inappropriate comment in my class?,"I teach undergrads. Recently they've been giving in-class presentations as the conclusion to a semester-long research project. Yesterday as one girl got up and was about to begin speaking, a boy loudly blurted out ""Holy shit! Those tits are huge!"" 

Yeah. *record scratch* ..... 

Once I recovered from a moment of 'did that really just happen' I immediately said to him, ""Why would you ever say something like that? That's completely unacceptable, you need to apologize and leave for the rest of the period."" Which he then did and there was no further issue from him.

I feel like I handled this as well as I could have? I've never had an overtly disruptive student before, I've had ones who don't do the work but the worst they do during class is just texting under the table. I was totally taken aback and so was the rest of the class. I heard a few whispers of ""what the fuck?"" and giggling, the poor girl looked mortified, and there's no way that's something you can just sweep under the rug as the teacher.

Last night I was telling my boyfriend about it. He didn't think I dealt with it well. He started questioning why I had the male student leave the room. His criticisms were that I was treating him like a child and publicly embarrassing him. When I countered that the female student was the one publicly embarrassed and I wasn't going to make her go on to present with someone who'd just harassed her in the audience, he said, ""Oh Jesus not everything is harassment, yeah it was horrible timing but guys his age are still awkward and making mistakes.""

I did not agree with this at all. He was completely missing the point. I started feeling like he thought what the male student did was okay. He said he didn't think it was but that ""young men need to be able to make mistakes without a woman crucifying them for it.""

The whole argument was ridiculous to me, it's not like I gave him an F or personally expelled him from the school. We're explicitly trained to have disruptive students leave the room if they cross a line. And this is college not high school, there are higher expectations for behavior. I'd clearly explained to my boyfriend that the comment was apropos of nothing, it was not a private joke between friends, the girl's chest was not exposed at all and there is no situation in a CLASSROOM where making a sexual remark about someone else is acceptable, ever. Let alone when it humiliates them right before they're about to be everyone's center of attention.

I ended up just dropping it because he wasn't listening. Now thinking more about it, it's been bothering me. Was I an asshole to the student?

Edit - I've replied to some comments but for some reason my comments aren't showing up when I log out? Don't know why but I'm assuming other people can't see them either, but they are visible on my profile.",2020-11-21 23:53:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jyle9d/aita_for_how_i_handled_a_students_inappropriate/,1465,7728,0.96,26
385,NTA,AITA for telling my sister to stop using the word family on me like it's supposed to mean something?,"As stated in a prior post I was kicked out at 15 for being gay. From 15 to 35 I had no contact with my family.  Over the years they have somehow managed to work their way back into my life.  Only in a small capacity.

My sister who is younger than me called earlier and asked what me and my husband were doing for Thanksgiving.  I told her that it was just us and that we were just going to have a nice dinner and probably watch TV for the night. And go to bed early. She told me that she was having dinner and that we need to show up.  I told her thank you but this was the first set of holidays in ten years that I didn't have to host and I was planning on staying home and just putting on a fresh pair of pajamas after a shower and not going anywhere. She then asked about Christmas and I told her the same thing.  She then asked when it would be a good time to get together.  I told her point blank that I wasn't all that interested given our history and that I was perfectly happy with how things were at this point.

This was when she got pissed off and started to yell at me saying that I need to start acting more a part of the family and that I need to let go of the past.  She told me that we as ""Family"" need to try and bridge the gap and move forward in a positive way.

I told her no we don't.  We hardly know each other.  We are very much strangers.  I also told her she needs to stop throwing the word family around like it is supposed to mean something to me.  When we started to talk again when I was 35 when our dad died her and my brother constantly berated me and told me that I need to just let them deal with everything that needed to be done.  I never disagreed with them. I told them them that they could handle it.  I was berated when our mother was sick for not visiting her in the hospital or when she was home.  I really don't have much of a relationship with my mom and she is a pretty good stranger as well so it didn't really matter. I threw everything back in her face.

Before we hung up she reminded me that it wasn't my husbands blood that runs through my body.  And blood is thicker than water.  I told her no.  My husbands blood did not in fact run through my body. But his semen did and that was close enough. I thought my husband was going to wet his pants.

So AITA for telling my sister to stop using the word family like it means something?

&#x200B;

Edit. 

Good Morning everyone.  I hope that you are all having a great day.  First I wanted to say Thank you for all the responses, awards and everything else in between.  This has been completely insane.  I never thought this would go so far. I have tried to read every single response but there are so many that it will take hours to get through them all.  

I wanted to do this edit to fill in some blanks so to speak. When I was kicked out I was 15 and my sister was 8.  So she did not have anything to do with what happen.  But she had every opportunity to find me after a certain point.  When she was 16 and had her own car she could have come find me.  When she was 18 and on her own she could have come to find me.  She never did.  When our dad died it was a friend of mine who talked me into going so that I could maybe find some kind of peace with what happen all those years ago.  She and another friend went with.  My husband (boyfriend at the the time) had to work and couldn't get the time off.  Initially I was greeted with surprise and thank you for coming.  But then with hostility from my sister and brother.  If they for a minute thought I was out to get something from them or our dads estate they were wrong.  I wanted nothing. And to this day I still don't. 

 My siblings have always told me what my place in the family is.  Which is basically I'm window dressing. I have been told that I have no business in knowing anything about the family finances, family affairs or anything. I think that they are afraid that I could potentially take something that they want or are supposed to get.   A couple of weeks ago my mom asked me to read over some financial paperwork that she didn't understand. Reluctantly I agreed but once my sister found out she screamed at me for putting my nose into areas that I don't belong. I told my mom not to ask me for anything again because I will not be involved.  

I have been asked a few times why I do keep in contact with them.  The answer is because it's my way of keeping ahead of them.  I do not voluntarily make contact with them.  I have no reason to.  I keep my Facebook locked down to the point that I don't show my city, my job, my phone number nothing.  But I can see all of their stuff.  This works because they post a lot and if I see that they are having problems with whatever the case maybe then I can work to make sure that if they ask for something I can not answer or just ignore them all together.  Plus it does give an open avenue for communication  in the even of  a major emergency.  Plus maybe I still hold onto a hope that they will maybe at some time they will actually apologize.  But I don't see that ever being the case. 

I have been asked if my mom has ever apologized.  No she has not.  And she never will. She is from a generation where parents don't apologize to their kids.  Because that would mean they did something wrong. She is from a generation where kids were to be seen and not heard.

I guess it comes down to this.  My family has formed this dynamic that I will never be apart of or want to be apart of.  And I'm okay with that.  I was not asked to come to Thanksgiving or Christmas.  I was told that I will be there. Why??? I don't know.  Then when I declined twice things got ugly.

386,NTA,"AITA for using my BFs last name, even though we're not yet married?","I've created a throwaway because I usually lurk here but don't have a main Reddit account. 

This is not a big dramatic situation, but I'm curious about what people will think since this has really divided people in my life.

I (30F) work as a copywriter in a fairly competitive field. I write in English even though I'm not an English native, but I have been working in this field and in English for over 6 years. Now, a couple of years ago I was looking for a new job and having difficulty getting interviews. After some time, I realized it may have been because my last name is very typical of my country (think Martinez or similar) and people were screening me assuming my English level. To A/B test this theory, I asked my boyfriend, who is white and English-native, if I could use his last name to apply for jobs. I didn't see it as a big deal as we're planning on getting married and me taking his last name anyway. To be clear: other than the name on the CV, I made no claims to be an actual English native, just native-level, and I'm always honest about my background in interviews. 

Well, guess what? It worked. I got my current job based on that CV, and now use his last name on LinkedIn and all professional channels. Recently, I shared this story with a (white, English-native) friend of mine and they were extremely offended. Firstly they accused me of denying my culture, birth country, and trying to be white. Then they said I was lying to companies and misrepresenting myself, and that I could be stealing this job from more deserving people. He even implied that he would go to my current company and ""reveal my secret"" which is ridiculous as I've provided my ID to them, so they know that this is not my ""official"" name??

I was taken aback at how seriously angry he got at this, and I wanted to know... Am I the asshole for using my bf's last name professionally?",2020-11-12 12:00:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jstemd/aita_for_using_my_bfs_last_name_even_though_were/,1950,20015,0.96,29
387,NTA,AITA for refusing to buy a coworker lunch,"I (23M) have a coworker (25M) who is a mooch. If you get something for lunch, he wants you to get him something too, but expects you to buy it for him because since you mentioned it, he says you offered. At first I thought maybe he had money problem, but then overheard him laughing and bragging to someone in another department about how he was able to scam lunches out of his coworkers, and he’s attempted to bully a free meal out of someone more than once. His general entitled attitude is one of the many reasons I don’t like him.

So yesterday my girlfriend and I had lunch together. He overheard me confirming before I left and asked what I was bringing him and I said nothing. He said I brought it up, and I corrected him. No, I was confirming we were still good and he was eavesdropping on my conversation. He started complaining so I had if he gave me money for his food I’d bring him something but I wasn’t going to buy him food. He started complaining about it again and I got irritated and said no money no food, and then I left.

When I got back my boss said my coworker complained I was being hostile. I told him what happened and how he’s constantly trying to weasel free food out of people, even some of the people he knows are struggling. So my boss asked around and several others collaborated what I said. My coworker got dragged into the office and now he’s pissed that I “narc’d” and how he was just kidding. Most of the office thinks he got what he deserved but a few think it wasn’t worth getting him in trouble over.

Today no one he asked told him what they were doing for lunch, and he’s whining that we’re alienating him. I said he alienated himself because of his behavior. He said I’m an asshole, but I don’t really feel bad that a mooch who thinks it’s funny to scam his coworkers thinks I’m an asshole.

388,NTA,AITA for pressing charges?,"My cousin turned 18 recently. She’s in high school. 

She doesn’t have a car, and during her birthday weekend, thought her parents were going to buy her one. They didn’t get her one and she was pretty upset. I should note that I’m not very close with my cousin. Or the rest of my extended family for that matter. I only heard about this through the grapevine from my dad. Anyway

My cousin texts me on the Friday before her birthday asking if she can take my car (I just leased a new Ford escape) to the mall and then for an out of town road trip with her friends over the weekend. I tell her no. 

She begs and pleads with me. I tell her no again. My car is for me to drive and for me only. If she wants her own car she can save up and buy one. She calls me a bitch and says that I ruined her birthday and that she’s embarrassed because her friends think she got a car for her birthday and she doesn’t have one. I don’t respond to her and think nothing of it. 

The weekend comes and I sleep in very late on that Saturday, waking up at 1:00 pm (don’t judge lol). Even though my car is parked in my driveway and my gate is closed, I come to realize that someone egged and TP’d my car. With many, many eggs and 5-6 rolls of TP. And since the weather was warm outside, the raw egg baked into my car, along with the dried up toilet paper, destroying the paint. 

Since I have security cameras around my house, I decide to go back and watch. At around nine thirtyish that morning, I see my cousin and a bunch of her stupid friends vandalizing my car. I’m surprise she didn’t smash the windows and poke holes in the tires too.

To save my post from the 3000 character limit, I obviously pressed charges and my cousin is in legal trouble. Her and her parents are pissed off at me for pressing charges, her parents telling me that she’s “just a kid” and that she’s been through a lot of ‘emotional stress’ doing virtual schooling for this past year and that I should take that into consideration, and that I should be ashamed of myself for pressing legal charges against my baby cousin, that I’m almost 30 and dont I remember what I was like at that age? (I do remember, and I wasn’t stupid enough to egg anyone’s car) and can’t she work something out with me like doing chores around my house for money if I drop the charges... that she’s young, that she doesn’t need a felony on her record, etc. and that it was just a prank. Right after I press charges, my cousin was calling and texting me over and over saying that this could’ve been avoided had I let her take my car. 

Am I the asshole in this situation?

389,NTA,AITA I almost died at work today and my wife is angry I didn't ask about her day when I got home,"AITA I had an incident where I lost control of an elevated work platform (EWP) on dangerous terrain whilst working today. The EWP slid down the hill, did a 180 degree turn through a row of trees whilst I was elevated at approximately 5m. It was harrowing and I was left shocked as it happened very quickly and felt like I was going to tip the machine.

On return home I had a shot (1) of vodka to steady my nerves and told my wife. She was cooking dinner and said some conciliatory things when I told her about the incident and asked if I was going to keep working this job. She then asked me to move out of the kitchen while she cooked. I got a visibly upset and then she said 'well you haven't asked me about my day. I had to look after our daughter all day.' We're in lockdown for covid and not allowed to leave the house atm. She then told me to look after our daughter who was having a tantrum.

She since doubled down on her position and said she had exciting news that she now wasn't going to tell me. I said that that was her decision.

I'm angry that it doesn't seem like she cares that I almost died and I don't think me being impolite and not asking her about her day is significant in this context.

390,NTA,AITA for not wanting to have my ex's stepdaughter some weekends?,"I (32f) have an 11 year old daughter with my ex. We divorced two years ago because he cheated. He is now with the other woman and is married to her. She has a daughter who will be 11 soon. Ex's MIL is sick and his wife has been going to stay some weekends to take care of her. Ex works weekends (nights, usually) and he asked me if I would take his stepdaughter those weekends his wife is gone. He framed it as being more time for the girls to bond. I said no. He called it unfair because I gave it no consideration. I told him I didn't need to consider it and that my answer was no. He said our daughter might say she wants it if I ask her and that they would throw me some cash for it. Eventually, after I came down hard on my no, he said the reason he wants me to do it is our daughter has chosen not to have a close relationship with his stepdaughter and he thinks my interacting with her and welcoming her into my home would cultivate our daughters willingness. I asked him was she mean or rude to the girl, he said no reluctantly and I told him that was all I was willing to interfere in and I am not responsible for cultivating our daughters relationship with his stepdaughter. I told him the discussion was over. He and his wife are pissed about my refusal and say I would be helping them out while they're in need.

391,NTA,AITA for kicking my sister out on thanksgiving?,"Hi Reddit, I am currently writing this both as a way to vent my frustration and to get a general consensus. 

My son (16) was recently diagnosed with an eating disorder. It was something that had been going on for months but no one picked up on it. Since being diagnosed he has not left the house except to go to emergency doctor appointments or for some fresh air. Because of his currently fragile state, he has to be watched a lot, have his meals weighed and measured (by his newly referred dietician) and he is not allowed to exercise, which is killing him as that was his favourite thing to do. Before COVID, he used to go for runs and his high school gym with his friends and the fact that he can’t now is very upsetting to him. 

Since his diagnosis, we have had to be very careful about what we as a family say and do. Obviously with thanksgiving coming up, we knew it would be extra hard for him. For dinners every year, we would make a big deal about the food and family and friends but with COVID we limited it to our family (me, my husband and my son) my parents and my sister who lives by herself. My sister is VERY socially conscious and decided to become vegan during quarantine. She openly talks about how much better she feels about it and basically talks bad about what other people eat if it’s not vegan. 

With the diagnosis and my sons consent, we told our family what was happening and made it very clear not to talk about food in any context, including veganism. Everyone was super supportive, and my sister asked if she found still bring her own vegan food. I said yes, provided she doesn’t make a big deal about it being vegan and her own lifestyle choices. 

Cut to today. Everything was going well until dinner. I brought my son his food and we had a happy dinner until my sister brought up how her tofu was better then the turkey my son was eating. We all gave her sharp eyes, and she then went on to say that there was nothing wrong with eating turkey but tofu would make her feel less tired and stuffed after. Although my son tried to put on a brave face, he ended up running to his room and having a panic attack. 

I  was so upset with my sister that right after dinner I told her to leave. She didn’t respect my wishes or her nephews needs and for that she wasn’t welcome. I packed up her stuff and told her to go, and we spent the rest of the night with lots of tension. My father claimed I was harsh and my mother didn’t say anything but my husband agrees with my action.

392,NTA,AITA for giving the entire inheritance to my twin brother?,"Am I the asshole for leaving my inheritance to only one sibling?

So I (30F) made money young. I dropped out of college to model, then started my own business and made some smart decisions with stocks. So I have quite a bit of money saved, my own property owned free and clear (just pay utilities), and a couple cars. I am single and childless. 

Growing up, I was very close with my twin (30M) but not so much with my other siblings (also twins, 28F). Basically they were favored quite a bit by my parents. I took care of myself starting in high school and so did my twin. He paid his own way through college with no parental help while I built my business also on my own. Our younger siblings did not. Our parents bought them cars in high school, paid 100% of their tuition and living expenses in college, and supported them in starting their adults lives. Both my sisters ended up in bad relationships where they had kids that the fathers eventually had nothing to do with. My parents have always given them plenty of money and support. 

I just got diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor. It’s inoperable and I am going to die within six months. I have made my peace with it. I opted to leave everything to my brother in my will. That was he can pay off his student loans and have a vehicle and home free and clear. I want to know he has a good life while I’m gone. 

My parents and sisters found out that I’m leaving everything to him and flipped out. They accused me of favoritism and being a bad daughter, aunt, and sister. They said my parents deserved money for raising me, and that my nieces and nephews deserved my money for future expenses since their mothers couldn’t afford things like cars and college. Even my grandma and my uncle’s wife who I barely see messaged me on Facebook to tell me how selfish I’m being. 

I blocked all of them in Facebook and told my brother I only wanted him to be at my bedside while I died.

393,NTA,AITA: For arguing with my fiancee after she read my late fiancee's dairy?,"My M34 late fiancee passed away from Brain tumour 3 years ago. I had known her most of my life we grew up together and were engaged for 2 years. We wanted to get married sooner but she got sick and never recovered after that despite doing all we could to fight this God awful disease.

My late fiancee had a diary that I gifted her right after she was diagnosed. She was the type that'd get very emotional and would have a difficulty expressing her feelings and opening up about her issues. She was very thankful I brought her the dairy and she told me I was the only one who really understood what she needed and how she felt. I'd see her spending a lot of time writing in her dairy wether at the hospital or at home. I never read it while she was alive but she let me have it a week before she passed away. I had a hard time looking at it and I left it untouched for over a year after her death. That's when I started reading it. I brought it up in therapy and it helped me tremendously.

I don't have much of her stuff. But I still have her diary with me. I'm now engaged to my fiancee who I met via a mutual friend and she was wonderful when I met her.

My current fiancee and I are open to each other. We'd talk about what bothers us all the time but at the same time there are things that I'd rather not share nor talk about. I'm getting better at communicating but I'm taking my time.

My current fiancee knows about my late fiancee's diary. Despite her asking to see it and I have no idea why she'd want that but I made it clear that I have no intentions on sharing what's in it with her. It's not like it's a secret but I know my late fiancee would want me to keep it that way.

My fiancee kept bringing it up. Knowing how uncomfortable that made me feel. And yesterday I got home and found out that she took the dairy and read it. I was absolutely pissed she didn't even deny it. Even tried to argue with me about why I was lashing out at her. Even though she disrespected my boundaries. She even refused to acknowledge that couples should have personal boundaries. I yelled at her for being so inconsiderate and for touching the diary in the first place. She got upset that I reacted like this and refused to talk to me for hours.

She's currently staying at her friend's house saying that I was being harsh on her.",2020-11-26 22:16:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k1omu5/aita_for_arguing_with_my_fiancee_after_she_read/,815,9423,0.97,28
394,NTA,AITA for not telling my MIL that my son is gay?,"My (41F) son (22M) came out to us as gay when he was a teenager. He has been with his boyfriend for four years and they are talking about marriage within the next two or three years. 

My inlaws are extremely religious and intolerant and my son has never felt comfortable coming out to them. He has no real relationship with them other than holiday/birthday pleasantries and we support his decision. We aren't particularly close to them either for reasons I will not get into here, but my husband feels like the less contact we have with them, the better.

My MIL has this bad habit with my son where she is constantly trying to involve herself in his dating life and has in the past tried to set him up with women she either met at church or on the street. One time she tried to set him up with waitress when we went out to dinner with them for her birthday.

The other night he was over at the house and MIL called up my husband (44M) on skype. My son participated in the call to give his Thanksgiving pleasantries. My MIL began harping at him about when he was finally going to settle down and find a nice girl to marry so she will get to be a great-grandma. She told him that one of her friends from church has a daughter that he would like and asked if she could give her his number. My son told her he wasn't interested and asked her to stop. She kept persisting and my son finally told her that he was gay and had a serious boyfriend he was living with and planned to marry. MIL flipped her shit! 

She ended the skype and immediately called my husband and started screaming at him. She told my husband that our son was a disgrace to our family, and started chastising him for not telling her about our sons sinful life. My hsuband told her that is is not our place to tell people that our son is gay, and if she cannot support him, than she is a worse grandmother than she was a mother and should be ashamed of herself. 

My FIL and SIL are now demanding that we apologize to MIL for upsetting her and ruining their Thanksgiving. My husband and I are standing firm that we have nothing to apologize for, and if anything feel that they should apologize to our son for the awful things they said about him and his boyfriend.

I was talking about what happened with my sister, and she told me that this would have never happened if we had told my MIL years ago that our son was gay.

395,NTA,AITA for telling my parents I have no positive memories with them,"Yesterday my friend came over. We have been friends for 5 years now and we were talking about the some fun things we did in school. Our school is on a huge piece of land and we found some planks and build a huge fort with a lot of our friends and it was our secret paradise where we would sleep during breaks or just chat a lot. We talked for hours about memories it was just like ""You remember when ........"" . It was a nice trip down memory lane.

My parents were pretty happy and they wanted to do the same thing but I honestly couldn't think of one positive memory I had with them. I used to run and hide because I was so scared of my dad.  I also remembered going through homework with my mom and it being a huge blow to my self esteem as she would call me stupid and worthless. I remembered trying to unplug my dad's Mac charger and getting electrocuted but the charger got spoilt and I was punished for spoiling the charger since it was expensive. I told them I cannot remember a positive memory and maybe they can help me remember. 

They talked about teaching me how to write but that was a negative memory to me since I was basically being threatened through out the process. They mentioned playing pranks like pretending they were angry at me but that was negative to me because I was just scared. They called me unappreciative and said that they were sorry they could not make me happy condescending.  Now I am wondering if I was the asshole, I am not saying I needed expensive vacations to have positive memories or anything like that, I  had positive memories in science class and I have positive memories of my older sister carrying me on her shoulders when I was little but all I remember is being scared of what my parents would do to me to the point I even flinch when someone give me a high five. I remember my friends asking me why I am scared of a high five when I flinch when they are going to high five me.

Edit:I corrected some spelling mistakes.

I asked my sister if she has good memories with our parents and she said she does but she has more bad than good ones with our parents, she also mentioned that she only remembered them because of random things like seeing the Nokia logo reminded her of our parents setting up her first phone and when she heard some Daft Punk songs it reminded her of us in the car going to visit our grandma.

396,NTA,AITA for not putting my baby in the outfit my mother in law bought for thanksgiving,"So I had a baby in September. She’s the first grandchild on either side so obviously everyone is all over her. We’ll call my baby Daisy

Both my parents and my in laws gave us different outfits for thanksgiving at different times. My parents gave me a little onesie and a overall dress with a turkey on it. It was pretty cute. 

My mother in law on the other hand gave us a onesie and a pair of pants, and the onesie said “I’m here because moms turkey got stuffed.” (I actually got rid of it because that’s gross)

We decided to split thanksgiving between the houses (everyone quarantined beforehand, tested negative, etc) and my mother in law immediately saw that Daisy wasn’t wearing the shirt she bought, and asked what had happened. I tried to dodge the question because I don’t want to cause a tense situation, but my mother in law kept badgering me about it, not even wanting to hold Daisy because she wasn’t wearing her outfit. 

Thanksgiving lunch was really tense and when we left, my mother in law texted me and said it was very rude that Daisy wasn’t wearing the outfit she bought her and demanded to know why. I finally told her it was because I didn’t want to put my 2 month old in a shirt that had a sexual innuendo on it, and looking back at photos of her first holiday, I didn’t want that outfit involved. She called me a killjoy and rude so I just left her on read. 

I feel like I’m the asshole because i could have just humored her for an hour and not have documented the outfit and that it was a gift.

My fiancé says he supported not putting Daisy in the outfit, and that it made him feel gross too. 

Am I the asshole?

I’m (16m) half Mexican from my dad’s side and my mom’s side is Scottish. Ngl most of my mom’s family is high key racist and is been problems sometimes growing up. My grandma on my mom’s side never liked my dad and was happy after they divorced when I was 7.

My names Emiliano and my grandma always complained how hard she tried to change my parents minds and it’s a shame I got stuck with it. I’m actually proud of it. My dad told me about the revolutionary I was named after and their history.

But literally my entire life my grandma refuses to say it. She says it’s “too many syllables” (i got a cousin named Alexandria and they say the whole name) and always came up with her own names. She says Leo or once tried to get everyone to call me “Elliot” as a nickname for a while. Obvious my moms family was for it but my dad refused that cause it’s not my name. 

Is always the same thing when I see them. She’ll call me Leo or whatever. Even when I correct her she says it’s not a big deal an keeps calling wrong name. I told my mom I don’t like it but she always say I’m just not gonna change her mind and no point in fighting it.

So I decided if she not gonna wanna call me by my actual name in not gonna call her grandma or say her right name. Is stupid I know but it’s bothering me more that she don’t care and all my other cousins she says their names fine, no nicknames. 

Her name is Susan so I decided to call her Sandy.  

Tbh I was scared to say it but that look on her face was worth it lmao. It wasn’t surprise Pikachu face but it was close. She said that is not how I address her and it’s “grandma”. I told her nah I’mma call her sandy from now until she says my actual name.

It got awkward. My mom was serious and my gma got super red in the face. She started ranting about me being a fucking disrespectful child and this is all my dad influencing me again. My mom told me I need to apologize immediately but idk what gave me the balls to not do it. We ended up leaving there house early and my mom didn’t talk to me until we got home. 

She say what I did was outta line and I don’t disrespect my elders ever. She wants me to apologize and I’m grounded until I do.

Anyways my girlfriend makes a lot of tiktoks about how much she misses me and about army girlfriend stuff. She’ll post stuff like #armygf 

She also has a rather large following, in the tens of thousands and pretty much everyone in my unit and on base knows about this, and they non stop give me shit about it. My commanding officer will roast me in front of everyone. I checked the followers list and almost all her followers were other servicemen, most of whom are probably on our base. All the comments on her posts are people I know roasting me. 

So here’s some of the tiktoks she’s made. She’s done the classic “I’m coming home” song which plays over her hugging me when she meets me. There’s millions of those on tiktok. SHe’s posted tiktoks about how she upgraded when she dated me, putting pictures of me and her ex together, how she went from dating a boy to a man. She made another one about how she went from thinking one direction was her dream men, but then she met army men. She’s made tiktoks going off about how much she misses me and sends screenshots of our texts or video calls. I can’t remember what else she’s done. 

I know my girlfriend loves me and is doing this out of love but its got to stop. I talked to my girlfriend about it and she got really upset that I would tell her  to stop. She says I’m not appreciative of her and i shouldn’t tell her what to do. I told her I love her but I’m getting so much shit for this and its really making my life harder her.

399,NTA,AITA For blocking my brother's fiancee after she announced she was pregnant?,"
I'll explain the situation very quickly and I'll do my best to not leave out important details.

I (F33) been married for over 7 years and I been struggling with health issues that prevented me from having a healthy pregnancy. I've miscarried 3 times and both me and my husband are becoming frustrated And we've literally lost any hope. This has clearly become a sensitive topic for us and I can't help but feel absolutely horrible whenever I think about it.

My brother Sam and his fiancee have been together for two years now, she's a bit rude and would constantly bring up the fact that I can't have kids by making backhanded comments. for example she told my mom and dad after i miscarried for the second time that the family won't have any grandchildren til she and my brother have kids. And talked about how much pressure I must be feeling since the ""clock was ticking"" because women over thirty have less chances of having healthy pregnancy.

Even implied that my husband will eventually leave since he ""had a right"" to have his own kids since I can't give him that. As a result I've distanced myself from my brother and my family because she was present at their house the whole time behaving like this.

I had my third miscarriage this past week and I'm still dealing with complications both physically and mentally. I got a text from my brother's fiancee the next day. Literally after I got out of the hospital that she was sorry I miscarried and that she was happy to tell me she was pregnant. In the same text.

I couldn't help but notice the sarcasm in her text especially when she decided to invite me to my own parents house to celebrate completely disregarding what I just experienced.

I showed it to my husband then I blocked her immediately. She found out and she told my whole family. Told them that I blocked her right after I found out she was pregnant and used the fact that I didn't visit because I was being resentful and jealous. My brother was angry that I blocked her. He told me I was clearly being bitter and disrespectful. (My brother keeps parroting her words and won't even see anything wrong with her behavior. It's always been like this but now it's worse since she's pregnant and everyone is trying to please her) That I ruined this for them and that I shouldn't hate on my future niece/nephew out of spite.

Both my mom and dad weren't happy with what I did. Mom even tried to say my husband made me do this because we're too bitter to be happy for my brother and his fiancee. The extended family heard the news and said they were shocked I did this saying that I'm always known to be a nice person who doesn't pull this type of nonsense.

I didn't feel like what I did was wrong, but now I do, I feel so horrible but given how she treated me in the past I figured she did this deliberately.",2020-11-23 16:08:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jzkeyd/aita_for_blocking_my_brothers_fiancee_after_she/,1027,9865,0.96,52
400,NTA,AITA for not telling my mom I own her house?,"My wife and I have been having a discussion and she finds it really weird that I’m keeping this secret.

I bought a house prior to covid and so during the lockdowns I was able to get some really cheap contracting done because people needed work.  I got it fixed up to rent it out, not to my mom, but just anybody.  

When it became clear people were losing jobs I didn’t want to rent to a stranger just to kick them out:  so I kept renovating at a slow pace just to keep the house on the ups.

Fast forward.  I find out my mom is being evicted for not paying rent.  I refuse to send my mom money.  I used to and it damn near made me broke.  She has a gambling addiction and drinking problem.  She lost her job.  

So I tell her I have a friend who owns a house one state over.   With nothing to lose she found a job out of state, applied With an agent I know out there who handled the beginning part but really it’s my house and she wouldn’t have been approved otherwise 

I rent it to her at below market rate but enough to where I know she’s not wasting all money on gambling and drinking.  My brother and his son also live there. She didn’t tell “management” that go figure.  

So my wife is like, I want to go see the house.  I tell her what I did and she doesn’t seem to understand that I never told my mom it’s my house and why.  As soon as I tell her it’s my house she’s going to go back to being irresponsible and it’s bad enough my brother is freeloading there too but this is going to be a financial burden on us if we tell her.

401,NTA,AITA for not giving my roommates the code to the panic room?,"
When I moved into this house with these other two women I got the master suite since I was willing to pay more for it. It came with an extra closet and an adjoining bathroom.

What I didn’t realize until after we started moving in is that the door to the extra closet in the master bedroom was like five inches thick with a small keypad on the outside and a large locking mechanism on the back. The inside was set up with shelves and stuff like a closet though. 

The owner explained that it was actually a panic room, but they had always just used it as a closet. He did give me the code to it though. Since then I started using the room as a sort of safe and keep my valuables and other private stuff in there. I love being able to have a place in the house that I know no one else can access. There’s something comforting about that since this is my first time living with roommates.

Anyway there’s been a couple break ins around town. Now my roommates want to have the code to the panic room. Especially my one roommate, Emily, who has a daughter. Emily says her daughters really freaked out by the recent event and the idea of having a panic room helped her calm down and get to sleep.

Both roommates are saying it’s an amenity of the house and they should have access to it. I however think it’s an amenity of the master suite as it was advertised as an extra closet in the master suite. I also feel very uncomfortable with them having the code to it and being able to access the things I keep in there. So Im refusing to give them the code. I actually called the landlord and asked him not to give them the code and he agreed.

So now they’re saying I’m being a jerk and if something happens to them it will be my fault.",2020-11-24 16:57:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k08t3j/aita_for_not_giving_my_roommates_the_code_to_the/,1048,7052,0.97,5

1st time: Took all the kids to McDonald's and the oldest threw a fit because she didn't get the toy she wanted. She was yelling and saying I needed to buy her another meal to get her the toy. She tantrumed all the way back to my sisters house. During this the youngest kept throwing food too and wouldn't stop when told to.

2nd time: My sister and I took the kids to the zoo. The youngest spat in my oldest's ice cream because he got the last of the flavor she wanted. My sister made very little deal out of it and shrugged it off. The oldest told my oldest that's the reason you give them what they want.

The youngest tried to break something so we would be made leave. I stepped in to discipline many times and got told I was not their mom and they didn't have to listen to me. I ended up dropping them back with their dad.

4th time: Brought all four kids to the park and they didn't want to stay because they thought we were going to a water park. They did everything they could to ruin my oldest having fun and then when I pulled them back and said if they couldn't play nice or entertain themselves, which I tried to get them to do, they would run in different directions and yell. So we left after less than half an hour.

Final time: They were at my house so my sister and her husband could have a date night. They wouldn't eat the food I prepared (nuggets and fries) because they wanted pizza. They didn't want apple pie they wanted chocolate cake for dessert. They were spitting in everyone else's food and throwing it on the floor. I got the same attitude when giving discipline and they started yelling when they weren't getting their way. This lasted all night. They wouldn't go to bed. Didn't sleep. Woke both my kids up.

Each time I sat and spoke to my sister and she seemed to take it seriously, especially after I pointed it out after the zoo incident, and then the last time she shrugged it off as kids will be kids. And I told her if that's how they behave then I'm not going to have them in my home or take them anywhere. She said that was fine. Then after she returned to work post-lockdown she asked me to help out in a few emergencies which I said no to and she called me an ass for not helping. But the way they behave I am not willing to sign up for that. Especially if she's going to shrug it off.

AITA?

I wanted to add this here because more than one person has brought up why I would give them so many chances and subject my kids to them. It's because I was happy to finally be more active in their lives and I have always loved having a big family around us. We grew up with a lot of cousins and sometimes they spent time at our house and we spent time at theirs. I wanted that for my kids. So yes, I let it go on too long for my own kids sake because I kept hoping my sister was serious and the next time would be better but it never got better and eventually I do have to put my kids first and say enough is enough, which is what happened.

I am sad that it ended up like this though.

Adding some more details here that have come up along the way (also thank you for all the responses. I was not expecting it and I am relieved to see them all). My parents have had some bad experiences with them too. Throwing food on the floor, yelling at them, being demanding and rude. In my parents house they never spat but there was an incident in their own home where my sister decided my dad should get the bigger steak and the oldest did not like that and so, yeah, you don't need me to go into details. My parents were horrified. They're still horrified. They would never have allowed us to behave anything like that and at their ages it's just awful.

I don't know of any specific issues. Part of me is wondering if there is a reason they moved back here. Maybe it's just my negative mind after everything but maybe they lost all their support there? Maybe they had babysitters and help there but his family got tired of it and refused because of the behavior? No way would that behavior come out of nowhere but I wasn't around enough when they were little to know if they were acting out like that or not. Otherwise it sounds like they just get away with doing whatever they want and so they never learned how to stop. I am aware they've had some issues in school but I don't know any details really. I can't imagine they would get away with the spitting though. No way would a school tolerate that.",2020-11-23 09:15:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jzefjf/aita_for_telling_my_sister_im_not_taking_my/,944,10027,0.97,12
403,NTA,AITA for refusing to cook for my boyfriend's daughter even though she had a breakdown?,"I have been dating this guy, Mark, who has a 14 year old kid, Jennifer for a while now. 

I have only met her a couple of times, so we aren't that close. I started seeing her often after I moved in with Mark (during his custody time). 

We get along fine and I think we are bonding well. There is just one issue. Since I grew up in poverty, I hate wasting food. Jennifer has an issue with food. I am not talking about being a little cranky when hungry. She would cry and scream and even break things if dinner gets delayed by half an hour. 

During her last visit, work was very hectic for me and Mark. Mark had to go to office while I WFH. Since I knew how busy I would be end of day and how Jennifer gets, I woke up early prepare breakfast, lunch and dinner. I informed her the same. 

End of day, I am in so many meeting and calls and Jennifer barged in 15 past her dinner time and told me serve her dinner. I reminded her that the dinner was in the fridge and all she had to do was heat it up. 

She comes back 15 mins later and told me that she threw the food away and now she wanted me to give her a snack for the time being and make her something else. I told her that I am not going to do that and then locked myself inside the study. 

I could hear her screaming and crying and I refused to give in. Once my work was done (2 hours later), she was still crying. She never heated the dinner. She tried it cold, didn't like it, threw the ENTIRE dinner for 3 away and then started demanding me for a freshly cooked dinner. 

She begged me to cook her something and I told her that I already did cook her something and that she threw it away. I told her she can either cook for herself or wait until her father comes home and he can cook for her.

I went to bed hungry as I was so tired. Next day, Mark told me that he didn't get home until midnight and she was still sobbing when he arrived. Although he agrees that Jennifer was acting entitled, he also says that I should have just cooked her something once my work was done as I knew about her food issues instead of letting her cry for hours. 

I got pissed off and told him that I am not cooking for either of them anymore.

AITA here?

404,NTA,"AITA for not telling a vegan mom that the candy she stole from my kids and was eating, wasn’t vegan?","This happened on Halloween and the day following.
My neighbor, 38F (super vegan) has 2 kids. I (26F) also have 2 kids. 

My apartment complex didn’t do traditional tick or treating on Halloween.

Residents were advised to set out prepackaged individual candy bags on their patios/front door areas if they wanted to participate- but the traditional “knock on door, physically hand strangers candy” was not permitted.

So, Halloween comes and the kids are all dressed up and each building has a scheduled time where the kids go door to door. I ended up having to work late so my neighbor offered to walk my kids around with hers at our buildings scheduled time. About 45 minutes later my kids came home with a small bucket of candy (6 little goodie bags each from individual apartments that participated) everything was fine, and my kids didn’t say anything weird had happened. They were just excited to eat candy once they got home lol.

The next day I took my kids to the park directly across from our apartment complex. My neighbor was there with her kids as well. The kids were playing and she took out one of those individual goodie bags with candy in it from her purse and started to loudly rummage in it. She ate several pieces of candy and my daughter eventually noticed, ran up and asked if she could have a piece and my neighbor responded “nope, this is my tax candy, remember that This was my reward for taking you trick or treating last night” 
I was a little weirded out by that statement and asked what she meant.

She said that since she Is the one who had to take the kids out, she took FIVE bags from each of my kids as a “tax.”

Her son then chimes in and said “you only took two bags from us!” 
she responded with “but I’m your mom, I was doing OP a favor so they get a higher candy tax” 

I was thinking about how to respond when I noticed that she was holding a starburst candy and decided to just smile and nod and go back to watching my kids. I let her continue To finish off the bag of candy and then said “hey, aren’t you vegan? You know a lot of those candies are made with animal products right. “

I explained what gelatin was and how a LOT of those candies are made with it.

She was horrified, googles it and then told her kids that they were leaving. She said something about how she was going to be sick and stormed off. 

Now she’s giving me dirty looks every time we see her and won’t let her kids play if she shows up at the park and we are there.

My husband thinks I’m an asshole cause I should have either- not said anything about the gelatin, or said something right away when I noticed. 

I don’t think it’s my job to tell a vegan what is and isn’t vegan though, and she deserved it for stealing candy from little kids.

Edit #1 when we got home from the park after the gelatin incident, I sat my kids down and asked why they didn’t tell me that the neighbor took half of their candy. My oldest kid is six and my youngest kid is four. Six year old explained that as they went door-to-door during their designated trick-or-treating time she would have my four year old grab two bags instead of one from each apartment for the majority of them, she explained it to my kids that they were grabbing extra bags for her to be handed over at the end as taxation. So either freaking way she was directly taking candy from my kids or taking candy *from other kids through* mine. 

As for the authenticity of her vegansim- 
I may have exaggerated when I said “super vegan” when I first posted this. She claims to be vegan and is very, very in peoples faces about the benefits etc. it’s 100% about the health side- she brags about veganism curing cancer, diabetes, even some mental health issues. I have never once heard her talk about the benefits for animals. She also sells herbal tea products, customized gym clothing etc. so she totes a pretty big vegan “lifestyle” if that makes sense. 

Now for the gelatin. She knows what gelatin is, she knows what it’s made out of, she knows that there are obvious things that she can’t eat. But she had no idea that a lot of candy specifically had gelatin apparently. When I told her that they had gelatin in it, she knew what gelatin was but googled the candies to see if I was correct.

I think she is either really dumb or she eats non vegan stuff all the time when no ones watching and had to pretend to be horrified about it at this point, cause a lot of you guys have pointed out that you literally can’t be vegan and not know these things. I’m not vegan, I’m not even freaking vegetarian and I know these things. 

About the starbursts: a lot of you have said that starburst are vegan friendly. However starburst in the USA are made with animal gelatin. In the UK they ARE vegan though! ;)

EDIT #2 
I cannot thank you guys enough for all the insight on this, and if it weren’t for you all commenting and me being able to show my husband, he probably wouldn’t have told me what was actually wrong. 
Turns out he was calling me an asshole cause she’s been parking in his assigned parking spot and giving him dirty looks since this happened. I had no idea because I work from home and haven’t used the car in days. He finally told me why he was so grumpy about what I did. He hates confrontation and was miss placing his anger at me. I’m gonna talk to her about it first, then management if it doesn’t stop. 

I also bought several bags of candy that our entire family has been snacking on since lol.",2020-11-06 03:26:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/joxhic/aita_for_not_telling_a_vegan_mom_that_the_candy/,1954,28077,0.91,76
405,NTA,AITA for sending my husband to his dad's because he wouldn't let our daughter help me cook?,"My husband and I get along like a house on fire, we love each other and talk constantly about what's best for our family.

He's recently went back to work (he's a chef) and I'm still on furlough (I co-manage a bar.)

I cook from scratch everyday. I've recently let the little one (3 in March) scoop the chopped up food into the cold pot .

Chopped up carrots? She giggles and scoops then into the pot. Mushrooms? Giggles and scoops them into the pot. Onions, giggles and scoops then in. (I wash her hands after. )

Husband was home four nights ago watching us, making sarky little comments, 'she's too young' and 'you're cooking them wrong' etc.

He tried to get her to play with her blocks, which are her favourite toy at the moment, and she said to him

'No daddy, we do dinner, don't be nasty!'

He hasn't spoken to me properly since then. His dad has emailed me saying I should take the lead from my husband (since he knows best.) His brothers have texted saying I should just pick my battles. 

I told him if he couldn't have an adult conversation with me he should go and stay with his daddy. He left a couple of hours later, told me he would stay with his dad. He told our daughter he had to go to work. She was happy. 

I think I'm totally in the right. My little one wants to help. She is very proud of herself when dinner is ready because she helped cook it. 

I do kinda feel bad because I know how chef's can be. But come on, it's his daughter, he should be encouraging her!",2020-11-20 21:39:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jxy46r/aita_for_sending_my_husband_to_his_dads_because/,988,13772,0.96,25
406,NTA,AITA for telling coworkers extremely bluntly why I'm not participating in the office weight loss bet?,"Someone got the brilliant idea to make an office diet bet due to COVID gains, with people pooling in their money to see who can lose the most weight by Thanksgiving. 

I am one of 7 people not participating. Lots of preggos, some bodybuilders, and people who maintained their weight who aren't interested. Since I've visibly gained, they thought I'd want to participate. I didn't. Jen, in charge of everything, kept dropping by to remind me to turn in my form and my money.

I  said ""No thanks."" Jen wouldn't drop it. Other people got involved, asking me why not all the time, it'll be fun! Don't be scared, I'd ""feel better"" and ""look better"" (I told them no, I wouldn't) and it's a great way to bond, we're all in it together, it's like Weight Watchers!

""I'm not interested,"" and then eventually, ""I. Said. No. Drop it."" They decided I wanted them to convince me. Two weeks into the bet, they tried to trick on the scale to ""shock"" me. 

I contacted HR, people finally backed down. I'm eating my food one day (rice and beans), people sitting with me start dropping hints that how they feel so much better now that they aren't eating carby comfort food all the time. 

I said ""I'm glad you feel better.""

They took this as a sign that I ""knew"" I'd ""feel better"" again and started up saying I could still join in. I finally fucking snapped and said ""You guys suck. I'm a recovering anorexic. I get one whiff of competition and start starving myself for days and start puking up what I do eat until I'd have to get my third oral surgery to remove rotting teeth. Does that sound worth it to you?""

Chorus of ""wow"" and ""we were just joking.""

I said ""No, you weren't *just joking*. Congratulations, by the way. After you all wouldn't stop, I weighed myself for the first time in seven years and didn't eat for two days. Does that make you all *feel good*?""

None of them would look me in the eye, so I just went home for the day. I got a call from the women in HR, who were shockingly supportive of me. One of the bodybuilder guys stepped up and said he's witnessed a lot of the harassment and he doesn't blame me for my outburst. A few others did too. 

However, they had to cancel the diet bet (I didn't ask them to) and people are blaming me. Saying that I can't take a joke, it wasn't ""that deep"" and the girls present said they no longer feel ""safe"" working with me because I obviously have mental issues. One of them made a big stink about ""politically correct bullshit"" and how I'm the typical hypersensitive milennial. 

I go back and forth on this all day, thinking I should have just swallowed my anger and gone back to HR or just stopped eating lunch in the office or whatever. I didn't mean to ruin anyone's fun but I also feel justified in pushing back on their harassment.

407,NTA,"Aita for telling my stepsister and mom that even though her mom died, I also lost my mom too?","When I was six my mom remarried to my stepdad. He had a three year old daughter and his wife passed away in a car accident the year before. Even that young, I could tell my mothers attention was not on me but my stepsister. She catered to her every need saying it’s because she needs a mother figure, which I get. She was enrolled in many sports as a kid while I wasn’t in any because there wasn’t even money (she did 3, I did none). My mom would buy her the newest clothes and shoes and technology and I would have her hand me downs. She basically treated my stepsister like her daughter and I was an afterthought. While my stepsister had my mom and her dad, I had nobody. My dad was never in my life. They would go on family vacations without me. My stepdad loved that my mom prioritized his daughter over me. When I was ten they decided they couldn’t give my stepsister the attention she deserved with me in the house so they sent me away to live my with aunt in a different state. 


For three years my mom had basically no contact with me. I would answer the phone and it was always my stepdad or stepsister. My stepsister would say her “moms” busy and hang up. She would tell me to stop calling because if my mom wanted to talk to me, she wouldn’t have sent me away. I went six months without talking to my mom once. My aunt hated my mom for the way she treated me and told me I deserved better so she basically became a surrogate parent. When I was thirteen she ended up passing away from complications from a disease she had been suffering from. I was so heartbroken and my mom reluctantly allowed me to move back in after consulting with other family members to see if they would take me... 


I tried to justify it to myself as a teen that maybe she just doesn’t want to a mom but she WAS a mom... to my stepsister. She would post her accomplishments on social media, parade her around the family as her “golden child”, she even said she thinks my stepsister looks more like her than I do. I remember as a kid before they married my mom was so attentive and loving. Then she chose my stepdad and stepsister over me. I’m now sixteen and I hate my life because of them three. My stepsister is a bitch and whenever I bring up the differences in which we’re treated, she says her mom is dead and I’m selfish for not wanting to share my mom. Yesterday we got into an argument after she went through my clothes and she said I’m unwanted and that my mom is more of a mom to her than she is to me, IN FRONT OF MY MOM WHO SMILED THEN LOOKED AT ME TO SEE HOW I WOULD REACT. I said “Your mom might have died, but I also lost my mom too. You can have her, I’m already an orphan in my eyes”. My stepsister started crying saying that I’m disgusting for saying my mom is gone when actually it’s her mom that died. My mom co-signed and said I should be ashamed of myself for trying to make it seem like I don’t have a mom and I’m an asshole for the comparison.",2020-11-24 21:08:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k0dtg5/aita_for_telling_my_stepsister_and_mom_that_even/,796,9897,0.96,154
408,NTA,AITA for not pressing my husband to be more ambitious?,"I (48 F and 5’3) are married for almost 23 years with my husband (47M) an almost seven-foot-tall husky bear who have a heart made of honey and is the love of my life and the father of our daughter (21).

My husband is a SAHD and he nails it, the house is always in a perfect state of cleanness, his food is delicious, his coffee is the nectar of the gods and he is an extremely talented handy man who can fix or build anything from scratch. I am exactly opposite when it comes to domestic skills so for me he is a blessing and since I have a six figures paying job is not a problem that he stays at home, especially now that I work from home most days of the week, I am in heaven. Since I am the sole provider for both of us I give him a monthly allowance to be his fun money and he is more than happy with this because he is a frugal man and don’t have the most expensive hobbies, like he loves wood work and is very good at it.

So after our daughter moved out of the house to go to college in another state he has been a little bored at home, since taking care of our daughter was what consumed most of his time and due to complications during my labor we decided to stop at the one kid mark, pets are out of question because both of us are allergic to fur, so to kill his extra time he got a part time job at a local store on retail, you should had seen his eyes when he showed me his first pay check and said that he would do the same as me, put half on the household account and put the rest on our retirement fund I almost felt tempt to say to him to keep all the money from himself but he was looking me with puppy eyes so I said yes (and secretly increased his allowance), also I know the owner of the place and he is more than grateful of having my husband there because he’s not only great at interactions with the clients, but also because nobody is stupid enough to scream at a giant polar bear.

I think is better if I go to the point now, his dad always gave him shit for him being a stay at home dad even having an engineering degree (degree which has paid solely by my husband trough scholarships and him working to the bone during college) and that his was a waste, my husband never gave a f\*\*\* about his father because his father is a POS wo ruined three marriages, including his own (he was having multiples affairs with multiple married woman’s).

Long story short, my FIL got wind that my husband got a part time job and since my husband won’t listen to him he is pressuring me to pressure my husband to get a real job and be a real man, I obviously told him to go suck an egg, but when I talk about this with my friends they side with FIL and say that is strange that my husband is a SAHD and I fell conflicted because I love to have him at home and he is happy being at home, but I also fell that I am holding him back.

409,NTA,AITA for dying my hair orange and not caring about the feelings of a classmate?,"so i'll just get right into it and will try to make it as concise as possible. writing this during my spare period in school and I live in Canada, so no turkey day for me today.

I (16m) dyed my hair orange yesterday, my sister is in school for cosmetology and she wanted to try dying my hair and offered me $20 so i said sure, and she dyed my hair a bright orange, looking straight up like ichigo from bleach being an asian dude with bright orange hair. personally i like it, it looks nice, and my sister did a pretty good job and she's pretty proud of herself too so that's a bonus in my mind (she has had self esteem issues in the past)

so today i go to school, i get compliments on my hair and i was just kinda glowing. when i was at my locker, a classmate who is ginger approached me and said it wasn't cool that i dyed my hair orange, and that i was ""mocking him"". so i turned and asked what the heck he was talking about, mocking him? i barely talked to this dude before, we had like 1 class together in 9th grade.

he goes on to say that he gets bullied for being a ginger and that me dying my hair orange was an ""attack"" on him since i wouldn't be bullied for having orange hair.

so, i started laughing and said it was ridiculous that he thinks i'm ""attacking"" him for having my hair dyed orange. how does that even make any sense, like if i knew someone was being bullied for having orange hair why would i then decide to die my own hair orange. he kinda just went quiet and walked away leaving me pretty confused. 

My girlfriend says i shouldn't have laughed at him, and i told her i wasn't laughing at him, just laughing at the fact that he thinks i'm attacking him.

410,NTA,AITA for using my mothers own threat against her and calling my brother a tattletale?,"I will turn 19 on Thanksgiving this year. My mother is extremely controlling. She doesn’t think your birthday should be celebrated if it falls on a holiday, so myself and my older sister (22F) who’s birthday is sometimes on Easter will sometimes not be acknowledged at all because “your birthday isn’t a holiday.” And she will kick people out if they wished us a happy birthday. It’s ridiculous. This isn’t even the most controlling thing she does.  If you get upset, you’re the problem and how dare you hurt her feelings? So my sister said she’d bring me a cupcake for my birthday that I could have after everyone left. My brother (13M) overheard and told my mother and she kicked up a big fuss about it. She called my sister and they got into an argument, and now my sister isn’t coming at all because my mother uninvited her.

I miss my sister, so when she invited me to her place instead, I said yes. My brother tattled again and my mom tried to tell me I couldn’t go. My sister has offered me a room in her apartment and I’m really tempted to move. I told my mother I was going and she couldn’t stop me, and if she threatened to kick me out like she likes to do, I had somewhere to go so let me know if I need to start packing. She just sort of floundered for a minute before turning on the tears. I just walked away. She doesn’t want me to move because she needs my extra help with my brother, like driving him places and keeping an eye on him.

My brother said I was being an asshole, but I told him if he wasn’t always such a tattletale this wouldn’t be a problem. I then shut the door in his face. My sister is thrilled I stood up for myself, but I got a call from my grandmother (who is also controlling) saying I’m being ridiculous and I owe everyone an apology. AITA here?

I’m packing little at a time, I don’t want to raise her suspicion or she’ll be awful until I leave or try and stop me. I already have my important documents, and will leave either Friday night or early Saturday morning.

411,NTA,AITA for building a fence to keep out my neighbors?,"  

*Obligatory throwaway account.* Earlier this year I (26f) got an inheritance from a family member and it was a godsend. I finally got to move out and get my own place after living paycheck to paycheck. MY DREAM PLACE. I could never get a place like this without providence or cutting my way through the corporate ladder with a machete. But the most important part is the pool. I love it, I'd swim every day if the weather let me. It has helped me get in great shape. 

The problem comes from the neighbors. Mark(fake name) and Kaylie(faker name but it's something like that) have 3 kids: Brad(16m) Chad(14m) and Lea(11f). They started out friendly enough, especially Kaylie who's dripping with housewife, yoga, PTA energy. She told me about a week after I moved in over a plate of cookies that the prior owners of the house were an older couple who let her kids use the pool whenever they wanted because their kids were out of the house and they didn't like quiet. I, on the other hand, LOVE quiet. I am introverted, I love my privacy, first thing I did when I moved in was put up curtains. I told her I was uncomfortable with that arrangement, but perhaps they could come over ***OCCASIONALLY*** if they don't abuse the privilege.

Cue the children abusing the privilege all summer. Every time I was out swimming, it would not be long before Chad and Brad would run over and jump in, followed by Lea with her floaties. And being teenage boys, they'd always want to roughhouse, or gape at me or my friends when we'd get out of the pool and make gross comments. This would be tolerable if it happened once a week. They even brought friends a couple of times, and more than a couple of times I've had to tell them they need to leave cause I was with adults doing adult things (drinking, etc).

So now I'm putting up a fence, for two reasons: 1.I'm getting a dog. 2.I want my privacy. Kaylie ran out of their house when she saw me and a couple of friends hammering in the fence and digging holes for privacy hedges(I made sure everything was within regulation and right on the property line). She said if I put up a fence it'd be harder for her kids to come over and play. I said yup. She asked if I was planning on putting a gate between our yards. I said nope. Finally she asked, a little choked up, if I was depriving her kids of our pool. ""OUR"" POOL?? I told her how in the beginning I had said they could use the pool as long as they did not abuse the privilege, and they did. I said now they can only come over if invited.

She told me they were going to be crushed and saw me as a big sister, I told her no teenage boy looks at their sister the way those boys looked at me and my friends.

412,NTA,AITA: I abruptly left a Thanksgiving family dinner and told my little brother to come with me,"I’m (20f) the oldest out of three siblings. For privacy reasons, I’ll refer to my youngest brother (12m) as “Y” and other brother (19m) as “O.”

I’m struggling with an eating disorder that has significantly affected my weight, Brother Y is considered obese for his age/height, and Brother O has a lanky build with a high metabolism. Despite us three weighing roughly the same amount, we obviously have different frames.

Now, my parents had a small Thanksgiving dinner with the five of us and invited my aunt (43f) and her husband over. Everything was going well. We were having a good time, enjoying our food, sharing laughs, etc. It was a good night up until my aunt decided to talk about our weight.

My aunt pointed out that this is the first time she’s seen me eat an “entire meal” since my stillbirth. Bringing up a traumatic experience that I’m still grieving from (surely) made the atmosphere in the house intense. I didn’t want to ruin the dinner though so I laughed it off and tried to shift the focus on to something else.

But of course, she insisted on talking about it. She said that if I was in between Brother O and Brother Y’s weight, I’d be physically healthier. I found the comment to be unnecessary and ignorant because (like I mentioned before) us three weigh nearly the same amount.

Brother O didn’t pay much mind to what she said but I saw that Brother Y was visibly upset. He struggles with his self-esteem so when I saw that he was on the verge of crying, I told everyone that we should wrap up Thanksgiving. This made my mom hostile towards me because I was being “disrespectful” to my aunt and “needed to pipe down.”

After a moment of awkward silence, I grabbed my belongings and told Brother Y that we should leave to the “store” before it closes. The house is quiet, things are uncomfortable, and Brother Y and I head out. We didn’t go to the store but we did hangout at the beach for a bit and talked.

When I came by the house to drop him off, my parents refused to open the door. So now here I am, at my apartment with my little brother who finally went to bed after crying his eyes out. I did get an angry voicemail from my mom. It was pretty brutal. She told me not to bring him back until we both apologize to her and my aunt.

I know could’ve reacted and handle things better. I was just too caught up in getting my Brother Y away from them. So Reddit, am I the asshole for (basically) kidnapping my little brother during a Thanksgiving family dinner? Regardless, I do plan on apologizing but want to know if I should still stand my ground.",2020-11-27 14:04:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k21nhf/aita_i_abruptly_left_a_thanksgiving_family_dinner/,623,9097,0.97,24
413,NTA,AITA for not letting my step mum be buried with my dad?,"When I(24m) was very young my dad was diagnosed with cancer. He survived but it was very close and my mum bought a 3 person burial site in our local cemetery just in case he died so that one day we could be buried together. 

About 5 years after his cancer scare my mum died in an accident at work. Pretty much immediately after my step mum came into the picture. It was pretty clear from the get go that she was only interested in dad because of mum life insurance plus the accidental death payout. She had 2 kids from prior marriages(dad was her third). My dad was devastated from losing mum and I think he just saw my step mum as an easy person to comfort him. I absolutely do not blame his for the shit she put me through. 

My preteen and teen years sucked because of her, I was continuously bullied by her kids and her, I wasn't allowed to join sports teams or socialize after school. If I wasn't studying then I was cleaning and if I protested then I would go without meals. 

My dad died about 8 years after mum did and my step mum immediately kicked me out. I was only 15 at the time. There was a huge fight over my dads assets because he left almost everything to me. 

Long story short she has just died. Her children have approached me and asked that she be buried next to dad and mum. I have refused. They're now lambasting me all over SM and to mutual friends accusing me of being mean and that she was dads wife and should be buried next to him.

414,NTA,AITA for refusing to take the blame for neglecting my 2 year old niece?,"I(20) am the type who prefer to live in my own world most of the times unless working or asked to be social and usually spend my weekends alone in my room with doors and windows closed, headphone over head and either watch drama or play games. I live with my parents and sister(23), who is a single mother(for now that is, complicated) of a 2 year old.

I woke up at 1pm on Sunday after binging a series of movies the previous night, cleaned myself, ate something and went back to my room. At around 4pm my sister stormed into my room and screamed at me. I was confused at first but then understood that she had left my niece in the house and I was supposed to babysit her.

I don't mind babysitting but as, but I didn't remember her telling me anything about babysitting the previous day. She told me to check my phone and there it was - a text previous night from her telling me that she would be out next morning and asked me to feed and look after my niece till afternoon, I missed it. I honestly did not know that the baby was in the house and assumed that nobody was home. My niece had been hungry and must have been crying for a very long time(though I did not hear anything), soiled herself and was rather miserable.

My sister kept yelling at me till she got into tears, calling me unreliable, useless, waste of space and some vulgarities etc, which might be true but I don't really care. I responded that she should also be ashamed of herself for leaving her baby to someone as unreliable as me without even bothering to confirm that I have received her message. She as the mother and primary caretaker, not me and if anything she is the one neglecting her child. My sister cried harder, left my room and hasn't talk to me since. 

For the peace of the family my parents have been urging me to apologize to my sister for being harsh on my words and pushing blame to her. I can apologize if that is what they wanted, but I doubt she would forgive me. I think I was just stating the truth though, AITA?


Edit for clarity 


I do have a job, study and pay (lower than market) rent and do chors too, just that I don't like human interaction in general so when not required to be social I prefer to be alone reading, listening to music, watching drama or gaming.


I don't remember hearing my niece crying that day. It could be me my headphones canceling out her sound or that when she wasn't crying anymore when I came out. It could also be me being completely oblivious, can't deny that possibility. 


There are hundreds of messages on my phone every day, from advertisement to group chats and personal messages. While I do get notifications I don't tend to check messages that frequently when I am not working, so my sister's message got lost in there. 


Yes I am apethetic, always had been but I can be social when needed and get along with my peers. No I am fine so I don't need ""professional help"", just like how being gay isn't a mental issue that needs to be corrected(no offense, just a comparison).

415,NTA,AITA for calling my mother a racist bitch and disregarding the punishment she gave me?,"My  (17F) mother (35F) has always been racist, and she doesn't hide it either.  She makes comments about African Americans being ""ugly"" but the race she has the most prejudice towards is anyone who is Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc. She generalizes the way they speak and mocks them, she says they're all ugly, makes comments about how they ""shouldn't drive"" because they ""can't see"" properly, etc.

I've heard this all throughout my life from her and every time I've wanted to call her out but was afraid of what she'd say because all my life she's been a ticking time bomb and most of the time I'm too exhausted to deal with her constantly going on a rampage of saying cruel things and then playing the victim after it all.

This time in particular however, I was watching ""A Silent Voice"" beautiful anime movie by the way, it brought me to tears.  One of the scenes showing how Shouko speaks aloud was on while my mom was in the room, and of course as per routine she made a stupid comment basically stating that she's surprised anyone batted an eye at how she talks given that it's supposedly ""as unintelligible as any other Asian.""

I spoke up and said ""Oh shit, I forgot I can't watch what I enjoy without you trying too hard to make us laugh with an unfunny racist comment."" She said ""Excuse me?"" to which I replied that I was pretty sure she heard me, and then she asked me what it was like to have a ""fetish"" for Asian people (???) so I said ""What's it like to have such a bland personality that being a racist bitch is your main trait?""

She BLEW UP and told me I had no right to speak to her that way because she was my mother.  Basically I shrugged and I said that I'm treating her as I would any prejudiced person.  I was grounded for being ""disrespectful"" because apparently being racist is nothing but an opinion /s.

Pretty much the same hour I walked out of the house and announced that I was sleeping over at a friend's house because there's no way I was gonna serve a punishment for calling out a racist.  I'm getting mixed reactions.  Some say I was fully in the right and didn't need to change a thing, others say while I was in the right I should've just taken the punishment because I knew what the outcome would be.

416,NTA,Aita for suing my sister over a poster my sister's son destroyed?,"My sister brought her kids over two weeks ago.  In my office I have a vintage Marvel poster signed by Stan Lee and the artists of the poster.  The poster is over thirty years old.  Her son saw this and thought it was really neat and wanted me to give it to him.  I tried being diplomatic but let him know that wouldn't happen.  For certain reasons, my office door locks behind me and you need keys to open it. This is important.
Fast forward the next day.  We're going to the park and I can't find my keys.  We're looking around the house and I hear her daughter yell out ""oh no!"" And my sister and I go running.  Her son has opened my office and climbed on the desk to get the poster down.  In doing it he managed to tear it in half.
I'm furious.  This poster is not only irreplaceable, I got it signed with my now deceased grandfather.  It has a lot of sentimental value for me.  My sister completely blew this off.  Hell, she even started giggling when her daughter said ""oh no"" the second time because she thought it sounded cute.  
She didn't offer me anything, even an apology.  Her argument is that I should have had my keys on me because I should have somehow expected that her son would try to take it down from the wall.  
Dad and wife are firmly in my camp.  Dad recognized how important this was to me because it was only a few days before he suddenly passed away and was the last thing we did together.
My mom and sister are acting like it's no big deal.  Sister ghosted me when I texted her asking about compensating me for the poster.  I'm case anyone is wondering, when we moved into my house, we had the poster appraised at $3k due to the condition and rarity of this particular poster.  I was informed after Stan Lee's death, it went up but we didn't have it reappraised.  This particular one does go on eBay and unsigned fetch north of $2k.
When I served her, my mom called me up telling me it was no big deal and she said she found another poster on eBay and when I saw the link I realized it was completely different, and wasn't signed, or anything like that.  It wasn't even the same year.  Now sister is complaining to mom that I'm ""being mean"" for going after her and not taking her offer and instead making her pay for it.  She thinks I should just let this go because ""kids will be kids"" so aita here?

Edit: since this has been raised in a few comments, yes the poster was framed.  It was professionally mounted in a frame.  It was not tacked to a wall or anything like that.

Update:  Mom is now in my corner.  We hadn't really spoken about this much as I was pretty angry about things.  She didn't realize that it was this one particular poster and she knew how much it meant to me.  Right now she's trying to convince my sister of the seriousness of this.

Update 2:  Sister responded to the filling.  Her argument is basically ""it's really mean that he's coming after me for a poster, I offered to buy him another one but he said no so I shouldn't have to pay anything"" I've heard from dad that her husband is trying to convince her that this isn't going to go well for her and to come to a resolution.  It's not even a money thing, she does well and I'm not trying to destroy her.",2020-11-09 20:24:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jr5ixl/aita_for_suing_my_sister_over_a_poster_my_sisters/,1580,16053,0.95,29
417,NTA,AITA for telling my in-laws that they would be responsible if me and my husband divorced,"First, some important context. Last year me and my husband had our last child and the pregnancy was extremely complicated and life-threatening to both the baby and myself. At one point there was a 30% chance of both of us being alive by the end of it. Due to this I also have is some complications that are going to impact me for the rest of my life. During this time my husband was terrible. He did not support me at all and would get quite angry whenever I wanted to talk about it. He brushed It Off, didn't help around the house with the other kids, and got to the point where he was emotionally abusive. About a month after my daughter was released from the NICU my loving and caring husband came back but I was destroyed and told him that I wanted to divorce. Obviously we started going to counselling and during this time we found out that he had Asperger's Syndrome and was just really good at masking. Afterwards our entire relationship made a lot more sense to me, we always knew he was socially awkward and he has a lot of quirks and all of our arguments can be traced back to symptoms of his autism.

Now, after months of him not wanting to tell anybody he finally got the courage to tell his parents about his diagnosis. Their response? ""Oh, we always knew that. you were diagnosed with autism at 2. But we didn't tell you  so that you can have a normal life."" I was Furious, like I said all of our arguments have always been because the symptoms of his autism. So much hurt and pain for both of us could have been avoided had we known. My husband could have learned better coping techniques as a child, and I could have learned better coping techniques earlier in our marriage. I was so mad at them that I screamed that their selfishness could have cost us our marriage and may still. My husband was pretty pissed too and we both hung up the phone.

Now I'm getting phone calls saying that I took it too far and that his Asperger's diagnosis shouldn't have any impact on our relationship if I actually loved him.",2020-11-24 21:48:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k0elgq/aita_for_telling_my_inlaws_that_they_would_be/,590,10157,0.97,40
418,NTA,AITA for telling my daughter her grades were not good enough,"My husband and I both work as software engineers, we have 3 kids (15f, 19m, 21m). Both of our sons go to top tier colleges and have had good internships. They excelled academically in school and my younger son was valedictorian. My daughter on the other hand takes her grades a bit less seriously, pretty much all Bs with one or two As/Cs. 

One of my sons got a summer internship that pays $50/per hour in San Francisco over the summer and my daughter was saying how she wants to apply there too because the pay was insanely good. I told her where her grades are at right now are not good enough to get the opportunities her brothers were getting. That most average people don’t even make $50/hour  ten years into their careers. That she might have to take out lots of student loans to cover college because she might not get the academic based scholarships her brothers got. That her grades now will affect the colleges she will get into and therefore also impact her future career opportunities. 

My daughter started saying that I thought she wasn’t good enough and that I don’t believe in her, which is not true. I just wanted to give her some tough love and let her now that the rate at which she is going will not get her the same opportunities her brothers have. I think she is young enough to still make changes and get back on the right track, she’s a smart girl but just doesn’t take school seriously enough. However, her father says I was being too harsh. He’s white and I’m Asian so it could be just cultural differences between us, AITA?

Edit: I have asked her countless times if she needs any help with her homework and also offered to get her a tutor, but she always brushes it off and says her grades are fine

Edit: Since some people seem to be projecting in the comments, I’ll clarify that I will love/support my daughter regardless of her grades. But she has expressed many times that she wants to go to the same school as her brothers(less than a 5% acceptance rate) and that she wants prestigious internships too and to make good money. However, she’s refused to go to SAT prep classes like her brothers have had and brushes off all the times that I’ve said if she does want these opportunities, she has to bring her grades up. But again if she doesn’t get her grades up that’s fine too but I think I owe her as a mother the truth that she is much less likely to get to where her brothers are",2020-11-27 11:28:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k1zici/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_her_grades_were_not/,794,4125,0.95,5
419,NTA,AITA for icing out my cousin after she implied my wife was a predator?,"Hi, this is a throwaway.

I am a 27 year old woman and my wife is 33. We met when I was 25 and she was 31. So there is 6 year age difference, sort of. I’ll be 28 in December and she won’t be 34 for 9 more months after that. Neither of us feel this age gap is very significant. Despite really liking me, she was actually a little more wary than I was starting the relationship, not want to seem like she was a creep, haha! Not that it matters, but I was the one who initiated things and persued her at the start. 

My 27 yo cousin recently moved into the same city as us and has taken to showing up at our apartment whenever she feels like it, despite us nipping it in the bud and telling her multiple times we may be busy and that there is a pandemic. We put our foot down about two weeks ago and then she’s taken to FaceTiming. One thing she’s touched on before is our age difference. She seems to have it in her mind that because of the gap and that I am very feminine whereas my wife is a classic butch, that my wife is “controlling” or that she’s in charge (our cat is in charge) and I’m kinda like a ditzy whatever. I’ve gotten  so sick of it. Yesterday she called and she actually said “do you ever worry that what your wife did was actually kinda predatory?” which like what?!! I hung up the phone and texted her saying “I don’t want to talk to you anymore until you get these weird ideas and stereotypes out of your head and I certainly don’t want you here for thanksgiving.” She wasn’t even invited to our thanksgiving in the first place, but seemed to be hopeful that we would change our mind. 

I’ve been getting slammed with texts from my aunt and uncle. Cousin cannot return home for thanksgiving and knows very few people here. I’ve essentially isolated her.

Julie is very big into fad diets (Atkins, keto, South Beach) and every year she sends me a list of foods that she cannot eat and a list of things that she can. Last year I cooked her the exact keto foods that she wanted and she was upset the entire meal because my brother didn't want to eat it with her so they fought at the table. 

Last week she sent me a text message that she is now on the fertility diet as they are starting IVF and sent me another list of foods that she cannot eat and a planned menu for me to cook for her. 

I texted her back and told her that this year I was making one meal and one meal only and she could either eat what was being served or bring her own food. She texted back and told me that I was being selfish and didn't care about her. 

My brother called me up the next day and asked if I was happy about ruining Thanksgiving and started to yell about how at their BBQ last summer they catered to my food allergies (I am deathly allergic to strawberries and have an epi-pen). I told my brother that this was not the same as a life threatening food allergy, that this was  dietary choice, and it changes every year. 

He called my mother, who told him that we all find it difficult to keep up with Julie's dietary needs and that if she wants special foods, she needs to bring them herself.

Now my entire family is fighting with each other, my brother won't speak to me and my SIL is posting nasty things about me on Facebook.

I talked to my husband about this, and he said this was ""ridiculous high school bullshit drama."" He told me he would be fine canceling the whole meal and it just being our family. I agreed with him and sent everyone a text message. I told them that Thanksgiving at my house is canceled. That I am serving (Thanksgiving menu). If they want to come over and eat with us, they are welcome to do so.

My sister is thrilled that I finally said something about it. She hosts Christmas dinner and is also tired of cooking extra meals. My mom however is upset that we are all fighting and thinks that I shouldn't have canceled the meal.

421,NTA,AITA for being honest with my neices about the reality of my career success?,"I just turned 41. I am very successful in my career in a very male-oriented field with all the expectations and stigma that entails. I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years. He's not interested in getting married, and at this point that's fine. Everyone assumes this was my dream and that I'm happy but it couldn't be further from the truth. I know there are women who live for this and want to be where I am, and I applaud them for it. It's just not me. I wanted to be a wife and mother and have a just okay job or even just skills so that I could support me and my kids if something happened. 

I was overjoyed to get married when I was 24 and the happiest day of my life was the birth of my son. He died of cancer just after he turned one and my husband died a year later, leaving me a widow just before my 27th birthday. I've never been close to my family for reasons that have varied over the years. I have friends, but they got their own families and lives. I had nothing, except for my career. I threw myself into work and found the ability to rise. Having a woman on their team looked good for PR, and a woman that didn't have any ""pesky women things"" was their ideal. 

I finally started dating my boyfriend and we aren't using protection, but I am well aware that the clock is at midnight. He is close to his family, especially his sister. My boyfriend's sister, who is SAHM of 5, has been really pushing for a mentor to her 2 daughters for years, and finally got her chance to push me into talking to them. I've never wanted to because I'm not proud or happy of where or who I am. 

So when I was finally pushed into speaking, I told them this. Yes, women can and should pursue whatever career they want, but my ""success"" isn't because I had a dream and worked hard, it's because my life was so empty and painful that I needed something else to think about. I didn't want to be the ""high powered career woman"", it's just what I had to do. Being a CEO (not my job title) means nothing to me. Their mother tried to steer the conversion by suggesting that I wouldn't give it all away now that I have it though, but I didn't let her and clarified that I would give it all away to have a family of my own. Honestly, if it would bring me my late husband and a healthy version of my son back, I would quit my job tomorrow and forget the last 15 years. 

Now his entire family is mad at me for ""enforcing gender roles"" and making it seem like being a SAHM (which every woman in his family besides me are) is the only way for a woman to be happy. I wasn't saying that. They asked for my experience and I gave it.",2020-11-08 06:11:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jq6v5g/aita_for_being_honest_with_my_neices_about_the/,1439,18997,0.94,44

I ( 48 M) own my own house (a three bedroom house) and my brother (M mid 20's) live with and pay 1/3 of the market price for a room in this area, just enough to pay for his part on the utilities.

My brother have a GF who doesn't live with us but spend most nighs here (think, more or less 15/16 nights a month) and i must say, it must be good to be young because they f\*\*\* all night log. how i know it? is because she is loud and i mean p\*rn star level so the nights she is here i can't sleep because os her screaming ""f\*\*\* my ass!!!"" all night long.

So last week, after she stayibg here for the night two weeks in a row she decided it would be a good idea to move in with my brother, but instead of sharing the room with him she would take my other free room. she told him her idea and he told me, i told him to call her so we could talk, she came and i said that if she gonna move in she will pay full rent.

She blew up on me when i told her how much the market rent was. i believe she thinked that she would be living here rent free since she was my brother GF and demanded to know why i would charge her with full price, i was sleep deprived and cranky as hell, so my mouth was faster than my brain and i said that since i wasn't the one f\*\*\*ing her in the ass she would nedd to pay full rent, she became silent and red while my brother was laughing his butt off on the floor.

after that she stormed out the house and since than my brother is the one hanging out at her place and i must say, i ove the silence, but AITA?",2020-11-15 22:34:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/juv2iw/aita_for_saing_to_my_brothers_gf_to_have_to_pay/,988,12232,0.89,20
425,NTA,AITA for not letting my parents stay with my kids for long periods of time because of my brother?,"I (27F) have a sister (26F) and a brother (15M) who is autistic. When he was 2 he was diagnosed with autism.

From that moment on he was my parents absolute priority. While I get it now, 14 years old me did not. It was like I woke up one day and my parents became very different people. Lots of money were spent on various types of therapy, lots of time were dedicated solely to him, lots of special occasions for me and my sister became second thoughts to my parents. They were not terrible parents but a lot of the things they did before like having meals with us every night, picking us from school became our nanny’s responsibilities as my parents were focused on my brother. I resented my brother first and with time my parents. The one positive thing was me and my sister becoming best friends.

I left for college when I was 18 and my sister left for the same college the year after. We lived together the whole time. Neither of us really missed home because who misses feeling like a second thought? We only went home for the holidays. In the summers we did car trips and had a blast.

When I was 21 I met my now husband. The three of us (me, sis and him) became super close. After that he joined our summer trips. We got married two year later and had twins the following year. The kids are now 3. We stopped the trips after the twins were born but after their first birthday we decided to go on 3 weeks vacations annually. When they grow up we will make sure to adjust the trips so they can join us.

Right after my sister finished college I got a job near our hometown. My sister had no reason to stay where we were so she moved back with us. My husband's parents live close, just two hours away and my parents and my brother still live in our old house 15 minutes away. For the first two trips after the twins were born we left them with my MIL and FIL. They are amazing grandparents.

Well, this year it clicked to my parents that my girls were obviously not going with us on the trips. They asked who had watched the twins the first two times and I explained that my MIL and FIL had. They asked to keep them this year and I said no, but thanks for the offer, we appreciate it. They wanted to know why my MIL and FIL could have them for long periods of time but they couldn’t.

I was honest. Said that I do trust them to babysit for short periods as I know they would never neglect the girls in those few hours. But I don’t want they to have them for three weeks. They need a lot of attention. And so does my brother. And while I don’t think they would do anything on purpose I’m afraid they will end up too focused on my brother and temporarily forget the twins need their attention as well.

They accused me of hating my brother (I don’t) and said that I was a horrible sister. They said I was punishing them for caring for my brother and preventing them from bonding with my girls. My sister and husband agree with me, though. But I fear they are just too close to the situation to judge.

426,NTA,AITA for moving out because my girlfriend moved her mom in?,"A few months ago I was near the end of my lease and instead of renewing it my girlfriend asked me to move in with her. Our relationship was at that level and she needed help with rent since her hours were cut and she had been dipping in to her savings to get around, so it just made sense.

I ended up paying 60% of all shared costs we were gonna go 50/50 but since her hours were cut and I already made more then her before that happened so I figured it would allow her to replenish her savings.

It was pretty great for a few months until she out of the blue told me her mom was gonna come live with us as she had lost her job and house. I told her I was not comfortable with that and asked if there were alternatives. She said that she could live with her grandma(her moms mom) but that her mom felt it was humiliating so that was a no go, I still told her I was not Okay with this. Apparantly living with your adult daughter and her boyfriend is less humiliating?

Now it is worth noting that her mom is...well...weird. she is very obsessive, entitled, high maintenance, puts her nose were it doesn't belong and is a very dominant ""do it my way"" type of person. She once had a meltdown because my girlfriend baked a cake for her nephews birthday and so did her mom she did not know about this but my girlfriends cake was better and que meltdown. I got dozens of stories like this.

My protests were ignored and 4 weeks ago her mom moved in to the guest room, day 1 was already a shitshow, I was going on a grocery run and noticed my grocery list had a ton of extra shit on it, when I asked her mom said she added it. So I asked her for money and she said she had none and my girlfriend acted like I was a dick for asking. It turned in to an argument with my GF were she said its her name on the lease so her choice who lives there. Long story short I noticed in the store all of the stuff she added was brand stuff and costs way more, and when I got at the cash register I had to pay 220 bucks were I usually spend like 90 bucks at most for the two of us, I put it on my GF's card, cause fuck I aint paying for that.

When I got home I called a buddy, asked him if I could crash at his place for a bit a few weeks at most while I look for a new apartment, he asked his girlfriend and they called me back later giving me the okay and I moved out the next day, I am mpving in to a new place in a week. Obviously we were barely on speaking terms when I left.

Now that we started talking again she has been adamant I am in the wrong and the only reason I did what I did was because it was her mom and not someone else, had it been her dad I would have been fine with it and I can't deny that lol, her dad is great.

427,NTA,AITA for ordering “immature” food at a fancy restaurant?,"I went to a pretty nice restaurant with my boyfriend and his friends yesterday. They live out of town and I haven’t met all of them before. It was us and four other people, all couples. My bf has known them since he was a teenager. They’re all 7-8 years older than me and all have nice full time jobs and went to private school.

If you got an entree at the place you could choose 2 sides. I got grilled chicken and Mac and cheese on the side. It wasn’t like a bowl of Kraft, it was on the adult menu and was made with truffle oil and jalapeños. I also got potato wedges and lemonade, I was the only one not drinking wine or anything.

My boyfriend said I embarrassed him by getting a “little kid” food. I know my tastes aren’t super upper crust but I don’t see the issue since it’s not like I ordered from the kiddie menu. I didn’t like any of the other sides so idk why I should suffer through eating asparagus and quinoa just to seem like an adult. He already teases me for not liking salads or sushi and stuff that much.

He says I’m not taking this seriously enough And I’m immature. he wanted me to make a good impression on his friends but I need to develop some better tastes before we do anything remotely fancy again.

I know I’m more of a “burger and fries” girl than “Wagyu and whatever rich people eat.” I didn’t mean to embarrass him I just don’t know what the protocol is, I didn’t start eating at nice restaurants until after we started dating.

ETA

Wow I come back to over 500 notifications lol. And since a lot of you are concerned about it I do eat vegetables I just don’t like lettuce or asparagus and some other stuff lol. I’m not living off of McD’s, I don’t even eat fast food.

I’m also tired of getting comments from people who haven’t been dirt poor telling me how wrong I am about “rich people food”. Like, sorry to break it to you, but fresh quinoa and kale and sushi is a privilege to a lot of people.

And I’m 22, there’s like 100 comments just asking me that, please let it end. I just don’t like alcohol, I’m not underage. Lemonade is the best beverage, you can’t change my mind.",2020-11-12 15:49:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jswxhn/aita_for_ordering_immature_food_at_a_fancy/,1654,6882,0.96,4
428,NTA,AITA for telling my husband to just 'stop',"My (29f) husband (30m) is a serial whiner, he moans and whines daily and constantly.



I'm a pretty positive person and I know I'm very patient but that has a limit. We have a son (18months), me and husband both work from home. 


Today he was bemoaning the fact that there was nothing for lunch in the house, but he didn't just moan, he started going on and on about how he was starving while I was trying to settle our son for his nap, I was trying my hardest to be patient, I even told him to wait for me to settle son then I'd pop to the shop and grab something, but no, despite the fact that I was clearly getting stressed because son was being difficult and was overtired so was screaming and crying and didn't want to be touched but wanted to be touched. Instead of offering to settle son himself he just continued to stand there whining about being hungry. Eventually I snapped, I lost my cool and yelled ""will you just effing stop"" and left him with son while I stormed outside with a cig to have just 5 minutes alone.


He came outside and told me I owed him an apology which I admitted I do but I also explained that I've told him several times now that his nonstop whining was effecting me mentally especially when it's me who does the food shopping, cleaning, getting up and dealing with son all day everyday while trying to stay positive, work and not go full Hulk and smash everything in a 6mile radius. I reminded him that I've told him so many times that his constant moaning is like a pickaxe to my mental health and every day it's chipping away at it and I can't take it anymore, I'm at the point where I'm one whine away from a breakdown. 



Anyway I later got a call from his mum, nan and sister who told me I was out of order for yelling at him and then lecturing him after apologising as that negated the apology. It's made me doubt myself.



AITA for telling him to just stop whining when I'm the one who deals with everything?




Edit to clarify some info - he was a alcoholic and when I ask him if he can go to the shop or store he says he can't go alone because he'll probably drink.


We were both raised very traditionally where men work and women stay home and do everything else. 




I am aware I'm a doormat and over the years I've gotten better but I guess not as much as I thought as I've let him and his family wipe their feet all over me. I appreciate every response even if I haven't responded to them all. I'm going to have a soul search and decide if I believe in him enough that he'll change his ways or if I leave (however scary that is).

We still get along fine, but he broke up with me because he wanted to discover himself in university and basically be away from me for the most part- but still talk occasionally. I talked to him about future plans, and when I told him the uni I wanted to go to, he asked me to please not go, because he wanted to go there and he didn't want to see me in real life.

430,NTA,AITA for wearing earplugs and headphones to sleep and study since my parents had a baby?,"I am a 21 year old college student living at home again because my college campus is shut down. 

I have a 17 year old brother, a 15 year old sister, and a 13 year old brother. So ... Yeah I was already sick of babies and babysitting and all that comes with that. Then this year my parents got pregnant, and had a baby girl. 

She's 3 months old now, and I'd been going a little crazy in the house already because it's noisy being around all my younger siblings. Now with a crying baby too, sleep and school have been difficult.

I started wearing foam earplugs to bed, the kind construction workers wear to protect their hearing, then I bought a pair of noise cancelling headphones for myself and started wearing them over top of the foam earplugs to bed. With a couple pillows piled over my ears. And I've been sleeping a lot better. 

I've also started wearing the earplug / headphones combination when I'm in classes or studying. I can hear the teachers through the headphones despite the earplugs and I am not distracted at all.

I've also been wearing them when I am doing things like reading books or video calling my friends. 

And my parents and siblings have started to get upset with me, saying that I've been completely closed off from the family, I can't hear anything like my parents calling my name. They don't like how I can't hear the baby to help out sometimes, my parents like all the siblings to help each other out and help with the baby when we can, and say it's dangerous for me to be blocking out her crying because what if I'm the only one who could have caught something bad happening if only I was aware of my surroundings

They've also been upset with me because I've locked my door when I sleep or study and a few times they've wanted something from me and couldn't get my attention. Like one time some of their family friends came over and they wanted all the family to come have brunch with this family. Which I didn't really feel comfortable with visits anyway but they were embarrassed that they couldn't wake me.

431,NTA,AITA for taking my kids outside for “wiggle breaks” during a private tea luncheon?,"Every year for my oldest’s daughter’s birthday my mom takes her to a fancy tea room. This year was a little different, they aren’t doing normal seating, you can only reserve private party rooms. Since she had to rent a whole room, she said why don’t we include everyone(daughter was fine with that) since there is more than enough space. 


My youngest 2 are 5 and 3. They have never been to a fancy tea room or anywhere that fancy honestly. The private room was small, just enough space for the table and chairs really. 


my younger kids were getting rambunctious so I decided to take them outside whenever I felt like they were getting a little too energetic. I never let it get to the point that they disrupted tea. We went outside, got some wiggles out, then I reminded them that inside we behave appropriately and calmly, stay seated, inside voices, use manners, etc 



The third time I decided to take them out my mom stopped me and said “last time”. I didn’t know what she was talking about so I just kept going. She came outside and reiterated that this was the last “wiggle break” the kids would be getting as it’s inappropriate to keep leaving the table like that. 


I pushed back that this was their first formal etiquette experience and while they are learning, they need time to get their energy out and be their best when back inside. No one is worried about what we are doing, just leave us be and go back and enjoy the tea with my oldest. 


My mom just said that she’ll take note to never do a family tea since it’s clearly too much for us to handle.


I talked to my sister and she sees both sides. She thinks I should’ve just said ok when our mom decided no more outside breaks since it was her tea brunch that she planned and was paying for. On the other hand, she thinks it’s petty of our mom to make that demand to begin with because it wasn’t hurting anyone",2020-11-23 16:30:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jzkuqf/aita_for_taking_my_kids_outside_for_wiggle_breaks/,680,7257,0.97,7
432,NTA,AITA for telling my husband he is either married to me or his co-worker?,"My (37f) husband (40m) has been working at his company for 10 years as a maintenance supervisor. About a year ago they hired Tabitha\* to work in their accounting department. Since the day she first started working there, she has had an infatuation with my husband that is now becoming unprofessional and inappropriate.

This started when the heat went out in her office. My husband's job as supervisor is to assign tasks to his employees, however, she is never satisfied with the work they do, even though he says that they do great work, so she demands he work on her office. She constantly calls him on his work phone for mundane things (carpet is loose in a corner, loose screw on her coat hook) and he goes and fixes them without issue. 

Last year when we went to the company Christmas party (pre-plague times) she was very flirty with him, constantly grabbed his hand. When he introduced us she just grinned at my and said ""look there's Peter,"" and grabbed his hand and walked away. When we sat at the table she damn near pushed me out of my seat to sit next to him, and my husband told her to get up that it was my seat. She walked off in a huff, and when she saw me in the restroom she shoved past me. I told my husband what happened and he said it was fine, that she was harmless. I told him that she was not fine, and that she clearly had feelings for him and she was acting like a jealous girlfriend. 

The past few weeks this has ramped up to an astonishing level of inappropriate. She recently moved into a new house and my husband and some of the other guys from work helped her move and put things together. He gave her his personal cell phone number, and she has been calling and texting non-stop about things she needs help with. Multiple times a day at all hours of the day and night she will call and text him for help. Last night at 2:00AM she called about her heat not working right. My husband said he would go over and look at it after work. I broke down. I told him he was not going, that she could call a technician like everyone else, and that he is not her personal maintenance man. 

I told him very clearly that she has feelings for him and he is so dense he can't see it. I told him that while it is nice to help on occasion, she calls him all the time asking for help with things that she can do on her own (move boxes/furniture) or pay to have a repair person come and fix. I told him that once he gave out his personal phone number that he crossed a line, and I am not comfortable with it. 

He said that this will most likely be an easy fix and it won't take long, so I cried and told him that he can either to be married to me, or married to her, but I wasn't going to be the third wheel in my own marriage. 

He says he does not have feelings for her and that I am overreacting to him just wanting to help a friend. I feel otherwise.

433,NTA,"AITA for ""hacking"" my moms instagram to see if she violated NDA?","I'm a nanny for a high profile family. I signed a very extensive and strict NDA. Anyone directly involved in my life, mom, dad, sis, and husband, also signed an NDA. The nanny family recommended this, to talk about the job without getting into any legal trouble or putting them at risk.

Recently ran into one of my parents' neighbors, Amber, at the park. Amber asked how the new job was going, then proceeded to ask specifics about how it must be working for a family where the parents are (insert their jobs here). A direct violation of the NDA and something I could be fired and sued for.

My dad isn't the sharing type, like at all, so I figured it was probably my mom. I asked her about it in a casual “Hey how’s Amber,” way. I said I ran into Amber at the park and that it was odd because she knew details about my job without me telling her. My mom simply shrugged and said, ""That's funny. Maybe she googled? Or saw something on social media?""

My dad and sister absolutely hate Amber. They essentially said hell would have to freeze over before they spoke to her willingly. My dad ended our convo where I asked him about it by saying, ""The only thing I know about her is that her son just made partner at a law firm in New York and is making bank and that's only because mom saw it on instagram and told me about it.""

Right then, I knew my mom lied to me and it was her. She and Amber love to ""one up"" each other with their children's success, and I also just landed a great new job. I asked my mom about it AGAIN and she told me that I was being dramatic, making stuff up, and that she would never do that to me.

My mom doesn't text people, only DM's on instagram. I know her password so logged in to check her messages. There was an extremely long DM to Amber where she shared their professions, children's names, ages, private school, general locations of their homes, how they pay ""really well"", etc. Everything that we are legally NOT allowed to say, she said.

I called her immediately and said that I logged into her DM's and saw the message she sent Amber that was a violation. She started screaming at me about how she is supposed to be able to trust her daughter, she can't believe I hacked into her instagram, that mothers should be allowed to brag about their children, and then she hung up.

It has been a week without contact between the two of us. We used to speak every single day. I am starting to believe that maybe I'm the asshole here for violating her trust like that. My husband says if anyone violated trust here it is her and that I gave her ample opportunity to tell the truth before I intervened and sought out the truth myself. He constantly reminds me that they could sue us into the ground, and fire me, for endangering my nanny family's well being.

434,NTA,AITA for not wanting to use my inheritance on my kids?,"I got pregnant right out of high school I was lucky that the dad didn't run off and wanted to be in the child's life. He went to college while I stayed and worked at an office job. We continued to date throughout the whole thing and got married when he graduated from college. It took a while but with our combined incomes we can live a decent life. (middle class) I had two other children with him.

All of the kids are adults now and two are in college while the other graduated. Each kid had a college fund of about 50 thousand. Well, my father died due to the pandemic and in the will, I got a lot of money and property. If I sold the properties I would have enough to retire right now. I talked to my husband about it and we decided to sell the properties. With the combined money we were going to put 3/4 into our retirement fund, and use the rest to explore the world and fun money. I have never left the USA before and it has been a dream to see the world for such a long time. We are making plans to keep working until 2023 and then go explore the world for a whole year.

We told our kids the plan and they were upset that we weren't using the money to pay for their college /debt Every kid has debt since the 50 thousand didn't cover everything so they had to take out loans. It turned into an argument and  I put my foot down and said no and that I am finally going to do what I want. That I sacrificed enough and that I'm not giving up this dream again. My kids aren't happy but my husband and I.

I just wanted an outsider's perspective if I am being an ass.

&#x200B;

Edit (answer some questions) The kids are 26, 22, 21 and I'm 44. The reason the inheritance was so large was that my dad died unexpectedly and I basically got the rest of his retirement fund/ properties. ( he was retired for 7 years).

435,NTA,AITA for moving to avoid babysitting for my parents which prompted my siblings to do the same?,"I’m (22M) the oldest brother of 9 siblings. I have 5 younger brothers and 3 sisters. My sister is 20 and my brother is 19. Youngest is 4 yrs old and my other siblings ages range from 16yrs-7yrs. 

My parents would’ve had way more kids but my mom suffered from several miscarriages.

Pretty much since I was 6 I had to take care of all my siblings. I could never go out because my parents were working and nobody to take care of my siblings. I love my siblings but I hated never having freedom.

It used to annoy me like crazy that they would just pop one kid after another. Our house wasn’t that big so everyone shared rooms, never had any private space, parents made good money but because of so many kids they struggled financially.  

Yrs later I found out the reason why they had so many kids because they weren’t using any protection AT ALL. My mom said they didn’t believe in using protection and any kids they had were because of “gods will.” 

If they didn’t get pregnant, that was fine, if they did it was because that was God’s plan. I was so mad since I was the one also stuck taking care of all these kids because they’re too stubborn to use protection since it’s against their beliefs.

When my mom got pregnant again with my youngest sibling, I waited til my 18th and moved out that day. Made sure I moved far too (1 hr away) so I had that excuse. When my sis turned 18 she begged me to let her live with me and I said ya. My bro did too eventually. My sister has already moved out but he’s still there with me while we continue our college classes. 

They saw that I limited contact with my parents to avoid getting stuck babysitting so they wanted out too. Now my younger bro who’s 16 is spending more time at my place because he hates it at home.

My parents are mad at me for dipping out on them since that’s made my other siblings not wanna be responsible for the younger ones either. My dad told me they’re hurt I turned my back on my family and have made my siblings do the same.

Cause I’m the older one so I have the most influence on them and ever since I left they followed with the same attitude. A part of me does feel bad that they’re having a hard time but at the same time I feel they brought that on themselves just thinking they can have however many kids and expecting us all to just live with their actions.

436,NTA,AITA for saying I miss it being just me and my dad?,"My mom died when I (16f) was 6. My dad remarried when I was 11. He fell in love hard and fast with his wife and they got married six months later. She had three kids ages 6, 7 and 9 at the time. It was a lot for me. Everything is so much...more. Things are louder and busier and there are so many more people and I was never excited like they were but I never wanted to say anything so I kept my mouth shut and let things happen for my dad, who was so happy. On the inside I was hurt though. I was hurt that my dad seemed to be so eager to leave everything behind when he got remarried. We no longer did pizza after school on Friday, we no longer watched something together on Sundays before bed. Everything had to including everyone and when I would ask to do something just with my dad he would say no and look confused. One time my dad asked why I was so eager to do stuff with him but never cared about family time and I said because I missed him. He said I never lost him.

Then back in October last year they put us all into family therapy because for one of my classes we had to design something in computer class, I was given a family tree, did the family tree of my dad, mom and me and then grandparents, etc. My teacher showed my dad at at the PT conference because of how good it was and he and his wife freaked out about the steps not being included and so family therapy happened. First therapist was a dud, second one didn't make anyone feel comfortable and then when we were supposed to start with the current therapist Covid hit and we couldn't do them from home so we started in July or August, can't remember when exactly now. Then she was good and so I opened up. But I don't think they handled it well.

Four sessions in I was asked why I was distant. I admitted I found it hard. I felt like everyone else was so happy and I didn't want to rock the boat but it was too much for me and I missed when it was just me and my dad, because that's when it was most comfortable for me. She asked what I missed about it. I said it was the time I got with my dad, the fact it always felt like home, and it has felt less like home since more people joined the family, and I have felt bad about it but it was a lot going from three, to two for so many years and then we went up to 6 overnight and it was all so fast and they were so eager and started calling me their sister and daughter right away but I didn't feel that way and then my dad stopped doing our stuff together and I felt like I lost him.

My dad said he was hurt I wasn't happier for him and that I didn't give it more of a chance before rejecting them. My stepmom was hurt that after 5 years I hadn't warmed up to her and her kids enough to feel like they were part of my home. The therapist said how I felt was valid and asked why they felt like what I said was bad. And we have been going around in circles since.

AITA? I feel like I should have stayed quiet because now they're just mad at me.

Edited: I tried talking to my dad yesterday and it did not happen. He told me he needed space. So they're still pissed.

I also want to address that I never said I needed to keep my dad all to myself. I wanted him to be happy. But I wanted him to want to spend time with just me too. It didn't have to be all the time. But twice a week or even once a week alternating our old traditions would have been good, or even bi weekly. But there was nothing and when I asked I was told no. He's my dad. He's the only parent I have left and it feels like I was abandoned by him. Having more people around didn't make up for that. They could never make up for what I had with my dad. But our relationship is gone. It didn't have to stay the very same but it's just gone.",2020-11-22 09:01:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jysp7s/aita_for_saying_i_miss_it_being_just_me_and_my_dad/,687,8036,0.97,86
437,NTA,Aita For arguing with my fiancee and refusing to let her niece be the flower girl instead of my sister?,"
Mine (M23) and my fiancee's (F22) wedding is this month. Wedding planning has been literally a nightmare. Her mom keeps stomping boundaries and changes any plans we come up with to have a ""decent"" wedding and not let me ""ruin"" it and embarrass her.

Her mom thinks I'm a kid she calls me ""son"" and it's so annoying and inappropriate. My fiancee is the youngest in the family and I'm the youngest son in law in the family that's why I got this nickname.

Anyways. My fiancee and I already discussed and decided to have my 9 year old sister be the flower girl. She has mild cerebral palsy but she's functioning and does good at school. She's had people make comments about her and she's very sensitive so she'd get upset because of these inconsiderate people's comments.

My sister's is on cloud nine ever since she was told she will be the flower girl. She got her dress and so far she's tried it on more than 5 times asking me when I'm going to have the wedding which is sweet. Thing is My fiancee came to tell me last week that we will be making changes in terms of menu/invitation cards because her mom recommended other things instead of what we agreed on. According to her mom I have no idea what a ""good decent wedding"" look like and wanted to save us (herself) from ""embarrassment"".

I let it go. And didn't say anything. Because my fiancee told me these are small issues and that I needed to go with the flow. Okay no problem but to suggest that we picked the ""wrong"" girl to be the flower girl was the straw that broke the camel's back. She actually said she wasn't sure how my sister will behave at the wedding and that we shouldn't take chance and just pick her niece instead.

I told her no not gonna happen. Like I gave my parents and my sister my word. no way I'm going to make her upset and sad and let the niece take her place. My fiancee threw a fit and said I was overreacting. That my sister still gets to wear her dress but sit with the crowd instead of walking down the aisle. We been arguing over this the whole week and I'm now supposed to call her and say okay but I refused and I'm standing my ground and wanting my sister to be the flower girl despite what others say because this offends me and my family.

EDIT: People say that we can have more than one flower girl but my mother in law doesn't think my sister should even be included as one. She wants her sitting like a guest the whole time thinking she might ""misbehave"" where in fact my sister isn't like that at all. She's well-behaved and smart even better than other kids. My fiancee seems to agree since she wants me to say yes.",2020-11-01 22:07:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jmb5dh/aita_for_arguing_with_my_fiancee_and_refusing_to/,1971,18965,0.97,62
438,NTA,AITA for making my family member explain why she is correcting people for not being “culturally appropriate”,"My family member has recently gone to college and is currently a year into her studies. Within this year she has taken a cultural competence class which has opened her eyes to the many injustices of the world the she feels very strongly about. 

The issue with this is she has taken to heart the “white silence is white violence” that has been taught in this course and within the last few months has been verbally attacking family to the point that no one wants to have holidays with her. 

This reached a breaking point for me when she corrected another family member (who is on the autism spectrum and doesn’t always understand inappropriate) for making a joke when the dinner rolls got burnt and he said “the rolls are biracial”. She snapped at him that “that is NOT culturally appropriate”, causing him to physically sag, and then she attempted to walk away. I told her no, she wasn’t going to do that and as an adult, if she were going to correct another adult or ANYONE in general she was going to explain why. She got pissed and told me it wasn’t her job to explain why but now he would know to not say things like that. I disagreed telling her it was lazy and disrespectful to take the time to punish a behavior but not offer an explanation as to why. She told me I was being a trouble starting bitch and stormed out. 

So, AITA?


Edit: I automatically assumed that everyone would have known that OF COURSE after my family member stormed out, it was explained to my cousin why this happened. I apologize for the lack of explanation there. No way in hell would I ever not communicate this to him after just getting pissed at someone for not communicating this to him.

439,NTA,AITA For arguing with my husband after he decided to sell the house without telling me?,"
I F31 lost my late husband in 2016. He got sick with cancer during the first year of our marriage. It was absolutely terrible and devastating. I don't want to go into much details because it really hurts to remember those difficult times. My late husband suffered a lot and he didn't ask for much. He just wanted to be able to sleep but he couldn't. I remember when he used to tell me this and it broke me. I did all i could to ease his pain but I don't think it was enough at all. He was taken from me eventually despite everything. I have a good relationship with my former in laws and I'm grateful for the support they showed me. I wouldn't have been able to carry on without them.

I been married to my husband for 4 months now. He's a good man. We have our fair share of arguments just like any other couple. He's divorced so this isn't his first serious relationship.

Once he moved in with me he said he wanted to replace all the furniture even though it was in good condition. He insisted and even though I didn't agree I did it eventually because he'd get into an argument with me and turn his phone off for a few days. Next He suggested that I donate some of my late husband's belongings saying that I kept too many. This was hard for me to do but I was able to sort through his belongings and kept a few things. 

Last month we were talking and he expressed being uncomfortable living at my house. He told me that every time he'd come home feels like coming to someone else's home instead of his. He said that he can't enjoy sitting in the backyard without picturing my late husband there. He said he felt awful about it but couldn't help it. He refused to go to therapy thinking this was just ""ridiculous"". At this point it was clear he was making excuses to get me to move out of the house since he suggested this before we got married.

He knew how I felt about selling the house but still brought it up. He then told me about a job opportunity that he didn't want to miss and asked if I was willing to support him by agreeing to sell the house and move out of town. This was sudden so I asked for some time to think about it but I was surprised to find the house was already put on the market for sale. Even pictures were taken. I was furious. I had a huge argument with him. He said he thought I agreed but he knew I wanted time to think but just decided to do what he wanted. He lashed out at me when I asked if this job opportunity really exists and he said I was being selfish and inconsiderate. Then left and turned his phone off.

I have no idea how to deal with this issue especially since he says that I'm not being supportive and constantly making him feel pressured.",2020-11-24 22:08:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k0eysc/aita_for_arguing_with_my_husband_after_he_decided/,847,3425,0.96,16
440,NTA,AITA for being rude to my colleagues after they commented on my body and eating habits?,"
I started at my job about 8 months, which requires me to go to two different sites. (Site A and site B). For the first several months, I was part time due to an injury, and even after that was sorted I still spent the majority of my time at site A. The last couple of months I started working more and more at site B, so I got to know the staff better. Because of that I've started having lunch with several of them. 

This is where the issues have started cropping up, for some reason they can't stop commenting on how I look or what I eat. For context, I am a recreational bodybuilder, so I eat and look a bit differently than other people. I've had several people look at me with clear disgust in their face and say ""do you *always* eat so healthy?"" when I pull out my lunch. (Should be noted I NEVER comment on their food, unless its to say it looks nice). Several also call my food ""dog food"" and say that it's gross. Another time a colleague mentioned starting to go to the gym, and I offered to train with him, when another interjected that he would go to the gym if he wanted to be ""on some sort of vain and narcissistic trip"". This is between the classical bits of making fun of how wide my shoulders are, and accusing me of using steroids (in a very hurr de durr meathead, kind of way). 

It eventually became too much when we were having lunch two weeks ago, I pulled out some chicken and a bit of fruit. Which again prompted the ""do you always eat so healthy"" remark, this then morphed into talking about how one girl vastly prefers chubby guys, and thinks that my forearms are gross due to my visible veins. Which then caused another girl to say that she ""likes guys with a bit of muscle, but that's too much"". So I snapped and said ""you say that like I actually give a fuck if you find me attractive or not, oh sorry, could you lay out exactly what you find attractive in men so I can rearrange my entire life in the hope that you will find me attractive?"" 

Since then, whenever I get a stupid comment, I say the same thing back reversed, they ask if I always eat healthy, I ask if they always eat unhealthy junk food. If they make fun of my wide shoulders or say ""SteRoiDs"" I reply ""well, not everyone wants to look like an unbaked loaf of bread"".

This has caused some to go to their boss, accusing me of being rude, mean, and a bully. While others are not hugely bothered/understand where I am coming from. 

I've got a sit down with their boss next week, but wanted to know what Reddit thinks, AITA?",2020-11-25 15:50:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k0uk8a/aita_for_being_rude_to_my_colleagues_after_they/,504,8450,0.96,19
441,NTA,AITA for not wanting to share my birthday with my dead twin anymore?,"My 19th birthday is this Friday and I told my mom and dad I don’t wanna do anything if we are gonna have the birthday for my twin too. 

I was an identical twin and me and my sister were born early and she died a few hours after we were born. Every single birthday since I was little has also been a birthday for her. We go to her grave and put flowers on it and every gift has always had both her and my name on it.

Mom gets really sad and always cries for a long time and I have always felt overshadowed on my birthday. The grave visit and flowers and all have always been mandatory and I was never allowed to have friends over or have a party until after we did it. I want to go to dinner with my boyfriend for my birthday at his house and then I’m gonna watch movies with my friends.

Mom is upset I’m not making the hour long drive Friday to do the grave ritual and is really sad and my dad is making me feel guilty since I’m their only living daughter and stuff. I told my mom I don’t wanna share my birthday with a sister I never even knew and I’m done with sharing with a ghost since this has been my entire life.

My parents are really upset and now I feel rly bad and maybe I should suck it up but I am just so sick of it.

Edit
Ok so I didn't expect his much attention so I'll try to answer some questions I've gotten a lot of. 

First of all I don't live at home I live on campus which is an hour away from my hometown. Second, idc if my parents go, they can do whatever they want, just w/o me. I've hated going to the cemetery since I was like 13 and realized how weird it was but my parents were very ""my house my rules"" about going. I don't like standing over the grave of a dead baby just to pretend to feel sadder than I do.I know its hard on my parents but I just wanna have a bday w/o being guilted by them. My mom gets quiet and cries a little whenever my sister is brought up and its turned up to 100 on my bday (she died the same day we were born). It sucks seeing her like that. I love my parents but you can love someone and not like their choices too.

Also I have abt 10 unopened messages rn. I won't be reading them. Two of the ones I got earlier were really mean and one said I should have died instead so fuck off. Not reading anymore DMs don't waste your time. If you're afraid I won't see your opinion in the comments try getting over it.",2020-10-28 15:05:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jjpfbp/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_my_birthday_with_my/,2031,29474,0.96,105
442,NTA,AItA for getting mad at my friend because he photoshopped my wedding pics?,"About a month back, my husband and I got married. We had this very small church wedding with just family and friends. My friend,David, is a professional photographer and is kinda famous in our city for his amazing work. When I told him about my wedding, he offered to do the photos for free as a wedding gift. 

Yesterday we received the wedding pics, and well, he’s edited the heck out of my face and body. First thing I noticed was that he’s made my waist smaller to get that ‘hourglass’ appearance. The next thing he did was to edit my rather pointy nose into a small, button-like one. In some pictures, where my side profile is visible, he’s edited out the dorsal hump. The end result still looks like me, but also like every generic Instagram model you see online. I quite like my nose, and I quite liked the way I looked on my wedding day. 

So I called him up to ask if he had the unedited versions of these pics and he said he’s already deleted those. I told him that he shouldn’t have photoshopped my wedding pics without asking first and that it ruined the whole thing. He said that he only made subtle changes, changes that most of his clients ASK him to do and that’s why he was being proactive in my case. I told him that it was very stupid to assume that everyone likes/wants the same thing. He didn’t think he was wrong and said that he was trying to do a nice thing and I was being ungrateful. 

I told all of this to a common friend, and she thinks I’m overreacting because all he did was, quote, ‘make you look prettier.’

443,NTA,AITA for calling the police on trespassers,"My mom inherited a huge piece of land from her father. The land was originally acquired to be developed into a subdivision but my grandfather like the land so he kept it for his family. While entered to become a land where all his kids and their kids would build homesteads on, when he died none of my moms siblings really wanted it, so my mom was sold or just given their shares. 

I’m living on my own but came to visit my mom because  both my mom and I are people who have not been around people and that wasn’t the care with my siblings or other relatives. 

There are tons of trails on the property and I went to go walk with my dog and my moms dog (both off leash). My mom had told me that she has occasionally thought she heard Motor bikes but she had never seen them so she didn’t know if were on our property and since she hasn’t seen them didn’t have anything to call police about. 

While On one of the trails a motor bike zoomed passed me, almost hitting my dog. I yelled at them but they didn’t stop. After walking some more I heard what sounded like the guy coming back so I got out my phone ready to take a picture of him. When eh drove passed he realised this, slowed down and ask what I was doing. I told him I was taking a picture to show the police who I was just about to call. He quickly sped off. 

I did call the police and they said they wouldn’t be there for about 45 minutes  to do an offical report which was okay because it would take me while to walk back to the main house. 

BTW any and all entrances to the property have clear signs that say it is private property not to tress pass About fifteen minutes later I was in a part of the trail that parallels a road and was near one of the back entrances we have. A Truck was sitting at the entrance. It had a different dirt bike in the back of it. I couldn’t tell if someone was in the truck but I knew the Truck didn’t belong to anyone that was supposed to be there so I took a picture of the back license plate. A guy rolled down the window and asked if I was the same guy “who said something to his buddy” I said yes and that the police were already in their way because this was Private property and they were trespassing. The guy gave me the finger and drove off. 

When the police came the I explained that whole this was the first time seeing them, this wasn’t the first time my mom thinks they have been on our lane officer basically told me I was wasting his time reporting such a minor thing, especially since it was thanksgiving. He said that I should let people have their fun. I reminded him that this was private property and these people were trespassing. He shrugged and said “well where do you expect people to ride their bikes around here when subdivisions are taking up all the land” 

My mom and I want to report the office but, I wanted to come here and see if I’m being an asshole here in even calling the police on these people.",2020-11-26 19:20:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k1lj3y/aita_for_calling_the_police_on_trespassers/,612,4275,0.97,4
444,NTA,AITA for telling my pregnant wife to go fuck herself?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons

To give context, I(28m) have a speech impediment and for my whole life, almost every single person I have known has made fun of and ridiculed me for it. And generally, I love talking and having discussions with people,  but whenever someone laughs at me I just die a little inside. In addition, my wife(27f, currently 6 months pregnant with twins, together for 13 years) is the only person I know who doesn't make fun of/ridicule me for it. But over the past months, my wife has the need to either laugh or make a joke about the way I talk, I have tried telling her how it makes me feel, but she does it anyway. Well, yesterday when we were having dinner(don't celebrate Thanksgiving) and she spends a good twenty minutes just making fun of me, I was trying to keep come but I couldn't take it, I got up and told her to go fuck herself, and just had dinner in the guest room. After about five minutes I went out to get some water, and I saw her crying at the table, I was of course to angry to care at the time and just went back in the room. After about an hour my wife came in the room teary-eyed and apologized, but asked if I could also apologize, since I was still pretty pissed I told her to fuck off, which came with more tears. Well, today I started to wonder if I was in the wrong or not, I just couldn't take the jokes anymore and just snapped.

I need an outside perspective, AITA Reddit?

\*EDIT\* to clarify, during the pregnancy, making fun of me wasn't the only change, in general, she has gotten a lot more angry, bitter, EXTREMLY emotional, anti-social, and resentful. I originally thought it could be the pandemic, but she was never very social, to begin with, so it didn't change much for her.

\*Update\* My wife after crying all morning tried apologizing again today, I accepted it but told her I dislike the way she has been treating me, won't be accepting that type of treatment anymore, and if there is anything wrong with her I should know. This of course came with more tears from here, and I can tell you guys it is going to be a long next two months for me.",2020-11-28 03:01:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k2fqwy/aita_for_telling_my_pregnant_wife_to_go_fuck/,605,4037,0.96,13
445,NTA,AITA for refusing to sign a document my late dads wife is pressuring me to?,"My father passed away three years ago from lung cancer which spread to his brain toward the end.  It was an awful time for us and I miss him terribly. My mum died when I was 15 and when she died her life insurance / death in service benefit paid out and it paid off the rest of the mortgage  on the house.
Due to my dad being (at that time) an aggressive alcoholic I moved out when I was 16. We still maintained a rocky relationship and the later years were much better and we were VERY close. I loved him so much despite the bad stuff. 

A couple of years later he met his gf. Eventually they got married around 2015. I never totally got on with her (nothing in common and hard to relate with) but my dad was happy and we had a polite relationship as I wanted my dad to have a companion. I’ve never considered her a “step mum”. 

Anyway, after he died I found out that his Will had been changed 2 weeks before he passed (whilst he had a large brain tumour) without my knowledge (I am one of the executors so was quite surprised I wasn’t told) which meant the sale of my parents home would go from being split 3 ways to her getting half and my brother and I the other half to split. We were not happy with how this went down but we have accepted the change to the will and moved on. 

she has now decided she wants to sell because she wants to move. She mentioned she wanted to get some work done on the house to increase the sale price and I emailed her saying not to spend much as it wasn’t worth it and it was unnecessary. She invited me over a few weeks ago to see the work and to give me some documents. When I got home I looked at the document she wanted me to sign agreeing to deduct nearly £16,000 from the sale of the house to pay herself back for the work. (Some of it was done ages ago and clearly for her living comfort and other paperwork only gave quotes for work not actual receipts or invoices)

The terms of the will are that she could live there until her death but she is responsible for the upkeep and maintenance as well as bills. She has lived there for 14 years rent free with my dad and 3 years without him 
  
My friends, family and I think is an absolute piss take to ask us for this money considering it is our family home which not only did both of our parents have to die for her to get but is our only inheritance from our parents.  

She is now pressuring me to agree to this and I am not happy I am being bullied by her to sign. She wrote the document, not a solicitor and no solicitor has been involved from her end about this. 

She has now told me she will withdraw the property from the market if I don’t agree. Which honestly (even though I am struggling financially and need to pay off debt) I don’t care about because if she lived there until she died then the house will just go to me and my brother and her (adult) kids won’t benefit from my parents.

So AITA for protecting what’s left of mine and my brother inheritance?

446,NTA,AITA for kicking my sister out of my home before she could eat?,"I will set the stage

The other weekend my boyfriend and I hosted our families for the first time since we moved in together. This included my boyfriends parents, grandparents (moms parents he grew up with) and his brother, my parents and younger brother and sister. My sister is 18. When she was 7 she got really sick and afterward my parents refused to acknowledge any bad behavior and this sent her out of control. She is demanding, spoiled and selfish and has never apologized for anything she did in her entire life since that day. It always drove me crazy. My brother gets annoyed sometimes but they were closer in age and had more fun with it. I was the grumpy older sister who had to deal with her shit more.

So the other weekend they were all here and she was going through our stuff. My boyfriend asked her to stop and she didn't. I made her stop and she was bitching about it. Then she started asking really intrusive questions to my boyfriends parents about why they let his grandparents live with them. Right before dinner she said she wanted pizza, not whatever crap I had made. My boyfriend told her we weren't ordering pizza just for her and she said she didn't want to eat my shit. I was so tired of her disrespect that I told her to get out of my house. She was shocked I kicked her out and thought I was joking but I told her she was not welcome in my home if she was going to disrespect me like that.

My parents are pissed I would kick her out in front of other company. I told her I was tired of the disrespect and she was acting like a child. They said I shouldn't have been bullying her. My sister is pissed that I would kick her out before she could eat but she made it clear she wasn't going to eat what I prepared and we were not willing to pay for her to get takeout.

447,NTA,AITA for not paying for my daughters wedding/uni?,"When my children were born my husband and I were determined to put aside money for their university/weddings/lives. We are not particularly well off but managed to scrape together almost $30k for each of our children by the time they were mid teens. 

When our daughter(24) was 17/18 she became involved in a very cliquey group of wealthy girls who were constantly showing off to each other. Long story short but in an effort to impress these girls our daughter committed identity fraud against me in order to open several credit cards and buy a car. She had no job and no way of paying the almost 45k of debt she incurred. 

My husband and I declined to press charges against her but we wound up with 45k of debt that we couldn't afford to pay off, she we ended up having to use the money set aside for our children's futures. We made it clear to our daughter at the time that she would no longer have that nest egg and that she would have to pay us back for the 15k taken from her brothers future nest egg. She got a job at a fast food place, went to therapy, did everything we asked and turned into a respectable adult. 

She never went to university but has worked her way up to being FOH manager for a small restaurant and we are proud she has turned her life around. 

Our son turned 18 in January. He was supposed to go away to university in England this year but ended up taking a gap year instead because of covid. As promised we gave him the 30k and he has put most of it into a fund for university and future traveling and spent the remaining 4k on a car so he could get to his job(he works at a plumbing store). 

Our daughter came home for the first time since before covid to tell us she was getting married to her bf of 3 years. We were super excited and thrilled to see her. However when she saw her brothers car in the driveway she asked how he bought it and my husband reminded her of the fund. Long story short she is now upset that we have given her brother 30k despite being reminded about what she did and how much it cost us. 

She is now demanding that if we want to be invited to her wedding then we have to give her an amount equal to her brother. Honestly we are heartbroken. We simply cannot afford to give her that kind of money even if we wanted to and we thought she understood our position. I feel like a terrible mother for letting her down but my husband is resolute that we did the right thing, we are the assholes here?

My thinking is that it's much harder to get a 1500 to a 1550 than a 1100-1150. You'll obviously get some sort of logistic growth in terms of effort. I didn't accept the deal because I honestly think it's unfair and I probably will not get significantly higher than last time. Scores this high will taper out and there is that random chance factor.

 

My step-sister is honestly pissed at me. She says she's been studying for a long time, and that she has really worked hard for the test. I honestly don't care. I shouldn't be punished for having a higher score. Once again, it's much harder to improve a higher score than a lower one.

449,NTA,AITA for not stopping stimming when someone said it freaked them out?,"Some backstory: I’m autistic and I self-stimulate as a result. Self-stimulating, also called stimming, is something autistic people do to calm themselves down, comfort themselves, and also just because it feels nice, ect. It can involve physical stimulations (Like snapping your fingers, bouncing up and down, rocking back and forth, fidgeting, fiddling with things, ect.) or vocal stimulations. (Like humming, groaning, moaning, babbling, ect.) (Non autistic people stim too, but it’s much more noticeable with autistic people.) 
Anyways I was at the mall and was a bit freaked out by the large crowd, so I started bouncing my leg and flapping my hands to comfort myself. A mother with two young kids was standing nearby and she kept giving me weird looks. I eventually asked her if I could help her with something and she told me to “Stop doing those things, it’s scaring my kids!” I apologized but told her I couldn’t because this was a copping technique I used and explained that I was autistic. She blew up at me and told me that I shouldn’t be so selfish and that being autistic wasn’t that hard. Am I the butthole here? I’m very confused because I find it hard to relate to people. Edit: Thank you all so much for the kind words everyone! 💗😊 I’m glad to know that I am not the butthole! Edit: Wow. I’m in shock.

450,NTA,AITA ruining my friend's birthday party by taking back the cake I baked for her?,"My friend is quirky. She was never diagnosed with anything but she is very clueless sometimes. I have had to spell things out for her a lot. Few months back, she borrowed a dress of mine. I really love that dress. There isn't any sentimental value but I got it when we were on vacation few years ago. She also loved the dress and one day just transferred the money to my account and told me that she was keeping the dress.

I spoke to her but she just told me that doesn't matter as she has paid me. Her birthday was a week ago and her mom asked me to bake a big cake for her. I usually sell cakes cheap (little more than ingredients cost). 

On her birthday, I went over to her house with the cake 15 mins before the party was due to start and then decided to talk to her mother. Like I said, sometimes my friend is really clueless sometimes and I was hoping her mom would speak to her and get my dress back. 

I was very shocked when she also said that as long as I was paid what does it matter. She told me to just move on as it was just a dress and that my friend really liked it. She told me as long the dress was paid for, what am I complaining about. 

I got really pissed off and pulled out the amount she paid me just paid me, put it on the table, picked up the cake and left. 

She got mad and started yelling at me that I was ruining the party. I kept walking back to my house. She kept telling me to give back the cake and that I couldn't take it back just because I want to be petty. I just asked what she was complaining about as I had paid back the money. 

My friend ended up having a cakeless 16th birthday because of this.

451,NTA,AITA for telling my sister the reason why no one wants her at the family trips?,"So when I was 10 years old my mother married my stepdad. It was a pretty smooth transition for me as my parents had been divorced for over 3 years by then and I wasn't really all that close with my father. My sister, who was 13 at the time, on the hand other hand hated our stepdad. 

She would cry, throw a tantrum, tell him he's not her father if he ever tried to discipline her etc. Stepdad tried his hardest to be a positive influence in our lives, but she wasn't having it. She even bullied our stepbrothers, 11 and 14 at the time, going so far as to making fun of their deceased Mom. 14 would call her a brat and laugh it off, but 11 cried a lot. Any attempts to tell her off would result in her threatening to go stay with Dad and nothing was ever truly resolved. Even therapy didn't help much. And I must state here that my step brothers never bullied her, it was almost always one sided. 14 would put 11 in his place if he ever acted out 

Now that the context is out of the way, here comes the meat of this story. So our Stepdad has a lakeside cabin, and every month on the second weekend he'd take us children there, to help us bond as a family and to give Mom a break. It became somewhat of a tradition (one in which Mon would join in too, but only occasionally) and helped us come together as a family. My sister refused to go, and after a year or so, Stepdad stopped asking, telling her she's free to join anytime she so wants. She never did, until recently. 

We're in our mid to late twenties now, living in the same city. We've continued the tradition, but it's only once or twice a year, which increased during lockdown. My sister said she wanted to join in. Caught us all by surprise really, but Mom says she's been wanting to come ever since she graduated from college. Stepdad agreed and she came along. It was awkward, to say the least. My brothers don't really like her, they're civil around her, but that's it. Even Stepdad is tense and formal when she's around. It just kills the whole vibe. I guess she picked up on it and asked me what's wrong.

So I told her. That it's way too late to try and be a family now and things are just way too awkward. Why try and force a relationship at this stage anyway, right? She got really mad and upset and is refusing to talk to me. 

So. AITA?",2020-11-12 05:38:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jsp52y/aita_for_telling_my_sister_the_reason_why_no_one/,1048,10722,0.97,14
452,NTA,AITA for not apologizing to my dad and stepmom for being a nightmare of a child growing up?,"My dad married my stepmom three months after my parents' divorce and it doesn't take a genius to figure out how their relationship started. I was 13 then.

He fought for 50/50 split custody and won it. I took out all my anger and resentment on their household. I was an actual monster of a child while I was with my dad. But my mom had zero issues with me. I was also very well behaved in school.

But over the years, I've wrecked a lot of stuff around their house and was generally extremely rude to them. I made both my dad and stepmom cry more than a few times.

When I was 16, I stopped going over to their house. I mellowed out with them but I distanced myself from them.

I'm now 28 and recently married. I recently met my dad and stepmom at my grandparents house for an outdoor  BBQ.

My stepmom overheard me telling my aunt that I love being newlyweds in a new home. She got extremely upset and said I ruined that experience for her. And she said the least I could do was apologize.

I basically scoffed and walked away without even acknowledging her. I think my dad and her handled the situation poorly in general and should've been more proactive about dealing with my issues when I was a literal child.

453,NTA,AITA for keeping my ex husband's last name after I was asked to change it?,"I've been married once before; my ex and I were a couple for a nine years and married for seven of them. We have three kids together (Ages 11, 8, and 6.)

I kept my ex husband's last name after we divorced. We're still friends and it was too much of a hassle to revert to my maiden name since I'd already graduated college and started my career with my married name. I also like having the same surname as my kids. My ex has never cared before, nor does my current boyfriend.

However, my ex recently became engaged to his new girlfriend. (together less than a year) I've met her only a handful of times, but she seemed nice enough and my kids haven't voiced any issues with her, which to me is the most important thing.

So I was shocked when out of the blue she contacted me a few days after they announced the engagement and asked that I revert back to my maiden name. I literally laughed out loud when I read her text, I didn't think she was serious at first but she was.

Her reasoning is that since my ex will have a ""new wife"" it would be wrong for me to keep his name. I essentially told her ""no f-ing way"" although a bit more tactful. My ex then called me and asked that I at least consider it since its something his fiancée *really* cares about, and that its not ""technically"" my name anyways. I let him know I wasn't going to go through the headache of changing it again, but if they were so concerned about names *he* should take *her* surname. My ex said I was ""being petty"" and asked me to just please think about it. I would have been happy to end it there but I got ANOTHER message from his fiancée which was basically a thinly veiled legal threat about suing me to change my name.

I didn't bother to respond to her message, you can't make someone change their name and I'm not concerned about some frivolous lawsuit at all. But I did screen shot what she said and sent it to my ex, telling him his fiancée needs to back the hell off, which he hasn't responded to.

My boyfriend also thinks the whole situation is stupid and thinks I should just tell them both to fuck off next time they say something. I don't know if I'm being an asshole though, I get its not my original name but its my professional one plus my kids' last name as well. I don't know, this whole this has been so ridiculous.",2020-11-25 21:38:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k11i89/aita_for_keeping_my_ex_husbands_last_name_after_i/,673,3541,0.96,5
454,NTA,AITA for kicking my friend out of my house even though she has nowhere else to go?,"My boyfriend(30M) and I(28F) moved into a fairly large house together last year. When all the Covid thing started getting out of hand we decided to open up our house to one of our friends(30F) and my bf's cousin(19F). The friend who moved in with us, Kate (fake name), lost her job before the pandemic and two month ago with the end of lease she couldn't afford a place to live.

My boyfriend and I have a common friend group that we knew since the college days, around 7 years. Kate joined this group 2 years ago. When our friends informed us of her losing her house we decided, hey, we have free space come stay with us for a while until you can find a permanent solution. We also covered the food expenses while she helped with the chores. She accepted and moved in within a few days.

When she first moved in she was acting friendly with me but as time progressed she started becoming colder and colder towards me but was still friendly with my bf. A month ago she started acting weird. While we were watching Netflix she started sitting in between my bf and me, touching or hitting his arm lightly when she was laughing, touching my bf's neck or hair while saying good morning to his ear or trying to massage him constantly. I didn't know what to do especially because my boyfriend was not saying anything at the time and i didn't want to be the crazy gf.

However he sat me down a week or so ago and told me he was extremely uncomfortable by the way Kate was behaving. Let me tell u I was so relieved that I was not the only one who was thinking she was acting strange lol. He said when im not around her behaviour only increases and he didn't know what to do because he was scared of telling me this as he thought maybe he was overthinking it. We decided to speak to her if she did it again and went to bed happy.

Two days ago I drove to my parents house to visit them and help with their needs as they don't go out. I got a text two hours into my visit from my bf asking me to come back home urgently. When I returned everyone in the house was yelling and I was very confused lol

When my bf saw me he said that he wanted to talk to Kate about what she has been doing was making him uncomfortable and apparently she didn't take this well because she said she did this with everyone and when I took my bfs side more yelling and calling names happened. We told her to get her things and get out.

I thought our friends would take our side when we told them about this but now the whole group is divided. Most of them said yes she was wrong if she was making us uncomfortable but that she is just a touchy person. And we were assholes for kicking her out in a pandemic when she had nowhere else to go to.

I trust my boyfriend very much as he has been nothing but an honest partner for the past 5 years. He said he decided to talk to her because she kept caressing his arm and touching his thigh and he hated it.

So I wanted to ask AITA for kicking her out?

EDIT: We talked to our friends and showed them the post. You guys were right about how she was telling a different tale. However, they were still not willing to take her in. Some apologized and we are not friends anymore with some of them as they thought me posting here was an asshole move even if I was right and for making them ""look bad"". She also apparently slept with one of the friends in the past and we didn't know that, not sure if that makes a difference. I showed the cousin the post and she confirmed that she heard bf talk to Kate in the hallway telling her he doesn't like being touchy before all this so that's for the ones that thought bf was cheating. Kate didn't have family close by so idk who she is staying with rn.",2020-11-07 17:45:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jpuqlg/aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out_of_my_house_even/,1124,18273,0.97,28
455,NTA,Aita for telling my sister's friend not everyone is rich and privileged like her when it comes to weddings?,"Most people think I should have kept my mouth shut. I will let you, the strangers of Reddit decide.

My sister (29f) got engaged to her fiance P (34) 9 years ago. They are still engaged and going really strong. The reason why they didn't have a wedding is because both of them spent whatever they inherited and saved up to pay their loan for college and had to start fresh. They didn't have a problem with that and neither did my parents. It was their money and they decided how they wanted to spent it.

My sister wanted a big wedding but things didn't go according to plan them. Her fiance was diagnosed with cancer and whatever they were making, they were spending it on his medical bills and rent. Now, they have decided they want a small wedding sometimes around next year.

My sister's friend, who got engaged last week invited me and her to her small covid safe party and when she addressed the crowd, half of her speech was about my sister. She called my sister poor, dumb and not driven (indirectly) because she is now settling for a small wedding.She implied all these things and everyone in the crowd understood. The rest of the party was awkward and while I was talking to some other people, I saw my sister coming out of the bathroom and she had been crying. I asked her and she confirmed it was about what her friend had said. 

Before leaving the party, I went up to her friend and told her because she had a trust fund and rich parents helping her throughout her life, she didn't essentially have to lift a finger to survive (graduated college 7 8 years ago and still doesn't have a job). I told her  my sister was a fighter and that she was so much more braver and smarter than she will ever be and left.

She apparently cried to her friends and I got some colorful text messages but I don't care. It's when my sister's bf and my other brother told me that I should have kept my mouth shut, I am having second thoughts. My sister is grateful I stood up for her but also thinks  I took it too far.

456,NTA,"AITA for telling my family they have no right to be upset that I ""ignore my culture"" because they alienated me?","I (33/F) am half-Native American and Irish. I am literally half of each. My paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants. My mother is reservation born with family still on the reservation that she is close to. 

I am almost a clone of my late paternal grandmother. It's shocking how similar we look. The only difference is that my hair is dark brown while hers was a blonde.

I grew up kind of the black sheep of the family. They didn't like my Dad and it felt like they kind of took it out on me. My material grandmother made it a tradition to gift each girl in the family a set of handbeaded moccasins for their 16th birthday, I was excluded (until my Mom brought it up and my grandmother gave me a pair six months later.) My Aunt taught all of the other girls how to dance, I was excluded. The only thing I wasn't excluded on was learning how to drum.

My paternal grandmother lived with us, and she knew they treated me differently. She made it a point to teach me the folklore, her recipes, and all about our family. My sense of taste in decor is also very Irish

I moved far away from everyone after college and I really haven't looked back. 

One of the only family members I am still close was attending a work thing for a few weeks last year. I brought up that they could stay at my place since I was closer than the hotel to where they were going than the hotel his work offered to put him up in, and it was on my way to work with an almost identical schedule. They took me up on it. 

When my cousin arrived, he were absolutely shocked that my house looked so Irish and that there was no trace of my Native heritage. He accused me of assimilating into white culture. I pointed out everything he already knew that I was purposely left out of traditions and family events because I either look white or they hated my Dad, so why would I identify with a culture that rejected me first?

He told me that I should've tried harder to embrace my culture and show them that I wanted to be part of their traditions instead of just flat out dropping them all together. I told them that I shouldn't have had to try to be included by my family as as child, I should've just been accepted as family.

In the end, we agreed to disagree, until I noticed that he took my drum! I had it in the guest room closet because I had no room for it in my bedroom closet and didn't want it to get damaged by my asshole cats. I ended up calling him demanding the drum back and he refused. 

My drum was returned to me after my Uncle who gifted it to me took it back and mailed it back.

It ended up escalating so now my whole family is involved and calling me TA. 

TL;DR: I am mixed Native American/Irish and was alienated from the Native American culture by my family and embraced the Irish side. My cousin thinks I betrayed my culture. AITA?

**Edit: In response to the decor questions:

It's actually literal pictures of Ireland that I took with my professional cameras from my vacations there with my paternal grandmother. I'm not talking small prints, I am talking very large professional prints of the landscapes. I took so many pictures because I loved it so much that there are literally pictures of the landscapes, both rural and urban, in every room.

In my den and my bar, it has a lot of Guinness things. My husband even got me a Guiness tap.

I also have a lot of my grandmother's handembroidered things that are celtic embroidery or are very reminiscient of such. She made money selling things like it here and did them herself.**",2020-11-18 08:26:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jwc4p8/aita_for_telling_my_family_they_have_no_right_to/,795,8028,0.97,25

My Son and eldest daughter are very close. They still fight but I wouldn't say is much as most siblings do, but whenever he wants to talk to her he just bursts through the door. If the door is locked, he just hits it with his shoulder until she opens it while at the same time, damaging the house. Whenever she asks him to stop, he ignores it and only stops for a day when we tell him to stop. He always talks about his privacy and the importance of it but disregards others.


Last week though, he caught her changing. She was very angry and upset and came to tell us about it. We sat down with our son and told him that if he can't respect other people privacy then he can't have his own. We then took off his bedroom door (He still has his bathroom door) 


My husband doesn't necessarily think I'm an AH but he thinks ""that's just our son"". He thinks we should've instead helped her prank him(???)

I'm a high school freshman and one of my classes is world history. Yesterday, we started on the holocaust. Before we started the unit, he explained to us that he is Jewish, and his great-grandpa was a victim of the holocaust and that he might get a bit emotional while teaching.

My teacher was explaining to us nazi standards, and he decided to use me as an example. I am a very pale, blue-eyed, blonde girl, but I have Jewish ancestors (i am not Jewish because I am atheist, but it is still my blood and my family that had to suffer.), which I guess he didn't know.  He looked at me and said, ""op, the nazis would've LOVED you. Actually, I wouldn't be surprised if you had nazi blood in you."". I was fucking appalled. I knew this teacher didn't like me, but he crossed the line when he compared me to a fucking nazi.

I'm not going to lie, I lost my shit. I got up and walked out the door and called my mom to pick me up. (no I am not supposed to just leave, but I did it anyway.) I told my mom what happened and she called the school and raised hell. She is friends with the principal and he insured her that he would either be reprimanded or released from his position. I think he's getting what he deserves. But my friend mia who actually really likes him called me an overdramatic bitch and that I just ruined someone's livelihood which made me feel really guilty.

AITA?

(i forgot to mention the way he said it. He didn't say it like a teacher making a connection or something to explain better, he said it aggressively and was pretty snarky about it. Which is one of the reasons I walked out.

UPDATE I just got home from school (i only have 4 hours due to covid) and he wasn't there. The principal said that he would be on probation (? don't know what that means for a teacher) and that he had to apologize. He refused, and quit that day. I don't know why he quit, he just did. Thanks for your kind words guys :) And a special thanks to Anotheravailable18, who messaged me and said ""overdramatic bitch, but you get it from your mama, Nazi"". I appreciate it.

So I told him how I believed it was karma, for helping you cheat on my mom, knowing you had  a wife and kids. My dad then got very mad and told me to go to my step mom and console her, but instead I packed my crap and went out.

My mom can’t she has arthritis, my other sibling can’t since his wife said no. Everyone thinks my family is perfect since we have a teenaged daughter (16) and my husband and I work from home.

Truth be told I hated diapers to the point of gagging. We like our peace and quite, and little babies are a full time job. I love my sister but there is no end date to this endeavor. 

My sister has a great job and I’ve offered her monetary help for a nanny, but that got shot down quickly. I’ve got extended family and her in laws harassing me to take in the baby. I want to turn her  down without burning bridges and not take on something I am ill equipped for.

Edit to add:
It was a hard no from my daughter and husband, even if I bring on a nanny to watch her. I’m torn since I want her to be safe and cared for.


Edit to add: 
Getting cps involved could hurt her job since she is in a sensitive field.

Update:
I used the day off today to go visit my sister in person. Because the phone calls where just getting jumbled. Her husband was at his family’s place today and it gave us a chance to openly speak. He’s is leaving for a 60 day rehab soon. My sister feels she has post-partum issues and being in lockdown just made matters worse since there was no space or buffer between all that was going on between her husband and doing everything for the baby.

She wanted us to take her little one because the mess in her personal life, because we have given my daughter such a stable and ideal life. She couldn’t see past wanting that for her own little girl, that’s why she was adamant that I just take her. We spoke of her anxiety and depression and came to an understanding that she needs medical help.

In all of this mess my cousin who took early retirement to travel but now can’t due to the global problems, offers and will move in with my sister and I’ll still pay for a nanny. My sister feels she will have support to get her mental health back on track and be a good mother to her child. 

Thank you to the people who pointed out that it might post partum related. I’m glad I took the time to drill down the issues that where affecting her and not shut her out right. As of now my sister and the baby are both at my house till my cousin moves in next week and the agency finds is a suitable nanny.

461,NTA,AITA for reporting my daughter’s teacher for forcing my daughter to write an essay,"My daughter (10F) is in fifth grade this year during this wonderful pandemic. She has been doing distant learning this entire school year.

I have had several issues with this teacher since the start of the school year. I have spoken to her numerous times when things have come up. 

For instance, her teacher has told the students, including my daughter, to use google whenever they need help figuring out a math problem while they are in school rather than asking her for help. She also always has her mic on, which wouldn’t be bad, except she was talking badly about parents and saying horrible things about the kids. I don’t know if she realized her mic was on at that time, but it was extremely inappropriate to say the least. She was very vocal about her political beliefs to the kids. Any kid that showed a different opinion was put on mute. I am a firm believer that teachers should not vocalize their political beliefs onto children. It is a very touchy subject for most people, especially now and teachers should remain neutral so as to not sway young minds. Each time, I have emailed her about it. I get it, this is all new to us and mistakes happen. It is a learning curve for all of us and that is okay. 

However, my daughter recently came to me because her teacher is now forcing them to write an essay about how they should get rid of turkey for Thanksgiving this year and go full vegetarian. The essay actually says that eating meat is unhealthy and goes on to talk about how unsanitary it is and how turkey contains salmonella and can kill you and that turkeys are killed inhumanely. It says to find the research to back up these claims and explain why it is better to be vegetarian.  

My daughter was not happy as turkey has always just been a tradition for our family. When my daughter brought it up to the teacher, my daughter suggested she could write an essay about how having turkey is a family tradition or about the pilgrims or about why turkey is a tradition for Thanksgiving. Her teacher told her that if she did not do the assignment as given, she would be given an F. 

When she told me and then showed me, I was taken aback and quite unsure of what to say. I’ve never had a teacher be so blatant with their personal beliefs and then shove them onto the kids for a grade.

She’s already told my daughter she would fail her if she didn’t do the assignment the way the teacher wants, so I am unsure if speaking to her privately would be beneficial to my daughter.

462,NTA,AITA for not telling my coworkers why I don’t want work friends?,"I had a yearly review last week and my manager said I have to go - HAVE TO - to an optional 5 day 4 night team building event (in the middle of a pandemic while we’re all still wfh) because my coworkers complained that I’m not friendly. Their evidence that I’m not friendly is that I won’t participate in the “work fam after hours cocktail zoom” which is just everyone gossiping and complaining and getting drunk. Their other evidence of my unfriendly attitude is:

I don’t friend my coworkers on social media and while my job does not require any travel at all, I also decline invitations to anything that has me traveling past work hours for work or work-related things like weddings or parties of thrown or hosted by coworkers. 

The reason for this (and it’s not their business) is that before I started working for this company my husband and I were workaholics- both of us always traveling and sometimes gone at the same time for up to a week. We had a nanny who was also a blood relative who we thought we could trust. We could not, it turned out. She left the kids unsupervised to go hook up and there was a very preventable accident that if an adult had been present wouldn’t have happened. Both kids are fine and healthy now but still have nightmares and we’re all in individual and family therapy. My husband and I found other jobs and we’re both home (not now, cuz pandemic) by 3pm. Our children don’t stay with babysitters anymore but did/do go to after school programs and sports that they love. Our only line in the sand is that mom and dad are home, no questions. (We both still have hobbies and do other things, but no overnight work travel for either of us). This was hard-won peace and safety that I’m not compromising on. 

When I took this job I was in a great position to negotiate so it says in writing in my contract that I do not travel, work weekends, and that I’m not expected to do so and that my tenure with the company is never reliant on me traveling. They adamantly agreed and tbh my field doesn’t need travel or training or overtime anything like that. 

I explained to my manager why I don’t participate in the zoom parities and other activities - because my kids come first. She said I’m a helicopter parent and probably need some friends and downtime and that people are really upset I don’t hang out with them.  I reminded her about my contract and she said they don’t have to honor it if other people complain?

This made me feel intensely, weirdly guilty about everything.

So we were all talking for a little while and the pet name slipped out, I never said it in front of anyone before because I understand people might find it odd and boy her parents did not like it, they started saying I was being racist and clearly have double standards, Suzie tried to tell them to be quiet and said that she liked the nickname and if she doesn't feel offended by it then they shouldn't speak for her but they persisted and her dad came out with one of the funniest things I've ever heard someone say to me in the most sincere way possible.

""how would you feel if she called you her chocolate daddy?""

I started laughing and Suzie tried to hide her face but she looked like she was about to cry from hysterics, I told him I wouldn't really care if it wasn't coming from a place of malice and we decided to GTFO as soon as possible, anyway now Suzie has been receiving messages from her parents saying they still think it's racist and disrespectful and I should apologise and drop the nickname but she is sticking to her guns that it's no one's business, and she even started calling me ""chocolate daddy"" and honestly I can't stop myself from laughing whenever she says it, but still, I feel a bit bad for causing an argument with her parents and causing her to be getting hounded by angry messages.

464,NTA,AITA for telling my father he and his family get nothing from me?,"I (19f) am in college. Four years ago my parents divorced after my father decided he was done being responsible and left. He came back after more than a year and he married someone else and was helping raise her kids. He brought our mom to court for shared custody. He was granted less than 50% because he was out of our lives for a while. I wanted to stay with my mom but the judge said he would order an evaluation to be done if we disagreed with his decision. I didn't want to cost my mom more so I went along with it. But once I turned 18 I was done and I didn't go back.

I have nothing to do with my father. He left us and then expected me to be his nanny. His wife tried to be nice to us but she wasn't part of the equation in my eyes. My father had shit on my mom, left her with three kids and debt he got into, broke her heart and he abandoned his kids. So I was there for my moms sake so she wasn't paying a crapton for court.

I have been helping my mom out ever since I graduated high school (before really, but more now). I help with groceries and sometimes I go over to cook and stuff so my brother (16) can get his tutoring and help with homework (he has dyslexia and dyscalculia) and so my sister (14) can get the therapy and stuff she needs while my mom works. My father found out I was helping and was annoyed I don't do the same at his house. I told him I owe him nothing and they get nothing from me.

He claims I'm punishing his wife and her kids for his mistakes. 

I don't know why I honestly even gave this any thought but is it a dick thing that I really don't care to help out his wife or her kids? They're almost strangers to me. We're not family. Whereas my mom and my siblings are. Ugh. IDK.

465,NTA,AITA for not telling my date I (21F) have Cerebral Palsy?,"Throwaway just in case.

I have mild Cerebral Palsy. It's not something that has a tremendous effect on my life, it never really has. People don't know I have it unless I tell them. Because of these factors, my condition simply isn't something I think about very often.

So I've been seeing this guy (25M) for a little while and I think he's absolutely brilliant. Incredibly handsome, smart and a bit dorky in a very adorable way. We've been on 4 dates and I got the impression that he was really into me, but on the fourth date a problem arose.

We hung out at his place for the first time, watched some movies and had sex together for the first time. We both had a fantstic time and there were just good vibes all around.

After that, we decided to have some beers and play games together. Now I can usually open beer bottles myself without a problem, but my hand was feeling extra weird that day, a bit crampy, so I asked if he could help me open it. Of course he asks me if everything his alright. I him tell him: ""Yes, I'm fine! I just have Cerebral Palsy and sometimes my left hand won't cooperate, it's usually not a big deal though.""

He proceeds to be very upset, telling me that I should have told him I have Cerebral Palsy before we dated, that I have decieved him, lied to him etc. The part that hit me hardest was when he said he would have probably never would have dated or had sex with me if he knew. I just don't understand why? Anyways, I felt bad and apologized profusely and said that because my condition is so mild, it's not something I often think about. Things got pretty awkward and tense after that, so I finished my beer and left shortly afterwards. This was a few days ago and he hasn't responded to me since. Sex is something very special to me so it feels weird to just be... ignored after?

I'm feeling like a bit of a shitty person right now to be honest, so I wonder, AITA for not telling this guy that I have Cerebral Palsy right away?

466,NTA,AITA for not letting my dead friends' parents see their grand son?,"I(31f) was best friends with Alexis(deceased 3 months ago, 31f), we had been friends since we were 9/10. Alexis was a single mum of 2, a daughter who was born deaf and is now 11 and a son who is 6. 

Alexis never had anything nice to say about her parents, she was kicked out of home at 16 and ended up living with my family because, as her dad said to mine ""she's old enough to sort her own shit out"" and that she was a waste of space. She ended up going no contact with her parents after that. 

About 4 years ago her parents reached out to rekindle a relationship and she agreed to let the meet her and her kids. The ""rekindled"" relationship only lasted for a month because her parents were rude towards her daughter calling her an r-slur and saying she would've been better off born dead. They also showed clear favoritism towards her son and would buy him expensive gifts and ignore her daughter. Alexis got sick of their behavior, gave them 3 warnings and then went no contact again. 

About 2 years ago Alexis was diagnosed with an advanced stage of ovarian cancer. She had an immediate hysterectomy and started chemo but it had already spread to several other organs and her spine. We sat down and I agreed to take her kids after she passed. They get along great with my daughter(7) and my stepson(11 - who had learnt asl so he could talk to Alexis's daughter). In her will she explicitly stated that she didn't want her parents to have anything to do with her kids. 

So now Alexis has passed and both kids gave moved in with my family. Since the funeral Alexis's parents have repeatedly reached out and asked to see their grand son. I have repeatedly refused. 

They are proceeding to slander me all over SM and have been hassling my husband and the kids schools.

467,NTA,AITA For Refusing To Replenish A College Trust For My Deceased Husband's Affair Child?,"Throwaway Account  


I (52f) am in an unusual situation and need an outside perspective but want to maintain my anonymity. 18 years ago it was revealed, at my husband's funeral, he had a pregnant mistress (40f). Obviously I didn't just take the woman's word for it and stated that she wouldn't get a cent until there was a DNA test. When it was proven true I was devastated but agreed to set up a trust for the child for college and agreed to let them live in one of my rental properties in a good area rent-free until her child was 18. She had to pay for utilities.

She agreed and I made it clear that I wasn't going to do anything else for her or the child. I also made it clear that I wouldn't take on the responsibility of fostering a relationship between our children and that it would be my husband's side of the family's job.

Fast forward 12 years and the mistress' child got sick and needed medical treatment. She didn't have enough money for what insurance wouldn't cover and reached out to me for support. I reminded her what our original agreement was and to borrow money from relatives for assistance. She said her credit wasn't good enough for a loan at the time and she didn't have anyone who she could borrow the money from. When I wasn't budging she got upset and accused me of being a monster for not helping a child in need. I reminded her that I already helped her child by setting up a college trust but she could use some of that money for the costs if she really needed it.

She agreed and her child pulled through. Now that the child is 18 and intending to go to college in the Fall of 2021 the mistress reached out to me about the trust and was upset when she found out that the amount was much less than what was originally agreed upon. I reminded her it was less because some of the money was used for the medical bills and that I never said I would put the money back in. I also informed her that I was going to start charging her rent the following year and she would need to pay or move out. I didn't care that she was upset because I was always straight forward about the situation but now my MIL and SIL are starting to say that it's unfair to the child. I don't see it that way because the mistress had at least 6 more years to figure something out so AITA?

Edit: Thank you so much for giving out your opinions and advice so far. However I do see some reoccurring comments and questions so I wanted to give more info just in case it changes your stance.

1. I am an American and live in the United States.
2. My husband and I were in our 30s and he died in an accident so there was no will. We were strong middle-class but not rich. My husband a Life Insurance policy that named me as the primary beneficiary and then our children, a house that wasn't paid off yet, $20,000 worth of his own savings, and two cars that was both in our names but also wasn't paid off at the time of his death. His mistress could've sued but it wouldn't have been much.
3. The rental property that I let her stay in was an inheritance from my side of the family that was solely in my name so my husband had no legal ownership of at the time of his death.
4. My MIL and SIL don't know the full details but they know I have enough money to the point where I could pay for the mistress' child to go to a decent 4-year school and not miss it, even during this pandemic. They on the other hand can't.

468,NTA,AITA for threatening to kick my brother out for trying to undo my service dogs training and telling me I don't need one?,"Throwaway account because my brother knows my actual account.

My brother Jack (25) recently lost his job. Our parents do not have any space for him at their home so he moved in with me (23m btw).

I have a service dog, Ripley. He is a 6 year old saint bernard and an absolute gentle giant. I suffer from some pretty severe agoraphobia and anxiety, prone to panic attacks when I leave the house. Ripley is a godsend and has been helping me get my life back together.

Jack doesn't really like that I have a service dog though. He doesn't believe that mental health issues are a big deal and that I just need to 'get over it'. Which, let's be real, is a lot easier said than done. We've never been particularly close and he has often accused me of being an attention seeker.

Due to the fact that Ripley is a service dog, it is very important that I keep on top of his training and I have a strict routine that both Ripley and I follow. However, around three or four weeks ago I woke up to Ripley growling. Upon further inspection, I saw Jack holding a lead and trying to pull Ripley out of my bedroom. I intervened and Ripley ran to my side. Jack told me he just wanted to save me the trouble of walking Ripley and had taken it upon himself to do it instead. I explained to him that this is not appropriate and that I am the one who walks Ripley. He seemed to accept this at first.

But over the past couple of weeks he's been going out of his way to go against my wishes. He tries to feed Ripley at different times, tries to give him food off his plate, will try to pet him when we're out in public (when Ripley has to be focused) etc. Literally anything to undo his training (which he admitted kinda smugly one night when he'd had a drink). Eventually I snapped at him and told him give it a rest. He fired back that Ripley must be absolutely miserable as he has no time to be a normal dog. This is, of course, completely untrue. He then called me an attention seeker and said I'm not physically disabled so I do not need a service dog and that the only reason I had Ripley was to get attention from strangers. I threatened to kick him out and Jack went silent and left the room.

Later, I got several angry texts from family members for threatening to leave my own brother homeless. I do regret it as I think I went a bit to far, Jack is absolutely terrified of having nowhere to go and the threat might have been a bit cruel. But at the same time, Ripley isn't just a dog, he helps me. He calms me down from panic attacks, helps/gives me reason to leave the house and just generally makes my life easier. Undoing his training would completely destroy that. AITA?

\[EDIT\] 

First, thank you for all the support you guys. The kind comments really mean a lot and I've been trying to read each and every one of them.

I've seen a couple questions in the comments so I figured I'd just answer them here.

Ripley is a service dog, not an emotional support animal. He helps ground me during panic attacks, helps me remember to take my medication and brings my medication too me. I can't say the other thing he does because of the rules but when I'm in a dark place and try to do something I probably shouldn't, he is trained to interrupt me and prevent me from doing it.

My family know exactly what Jack is like. They all conveniently had no space at their houses to take him in as they don't want to deal with him. They also do know how bad my anxiety is and agree that Ripley is the best thing for helping me deal with it, if think any differently then they haven't let on. 

And thank you to the people who mentioned that having Jack here is making Ripley uncomfortable. I feel like a horrible person for letting him stay so long and making Ripley deal with that, he's a good boy and shouldn't have to be uncomfortable in his own home. I have texted several of my family members, including my parents, with my side of the story. Turns out Jack has twisted it a little bit. I told them that they're welcome to take him in but I cannot keep him in my home anymore as he is putting myself and Ripley at risk. Some family members are on my side now but there are still a fair few who think I'm an AH. 

And guess what? My parents are somehow managing to clear out their storage room to make space for Jack. Isn't that weird. 

Anyway, thank you again kind people of reddit :)",2020-11-17 19:29:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jvzk4h/aita_for_threatening_to_kick_my_brother_out_for/,794,8394,0.96,18

I M37 been with my wife for two years and I have a 9 year old son from my previous marriage with a congenital heart disease. He's in the last stage and is currently on waitlist for a possible heart transplant.

The problem is that he's sick most of the time. We had numerous visits to the hospital, He's currently on medication but he's always struggling with doing activities and playing just like other kids. The cardiologist told me about a device called VAD that would help and improve my son's condition.

I've looked into it. Spoke to other parents of kids who have the same condition and I decided to get my son this device and I was told the sooner the better so that my son could participate in activities and feel comfortable while breathing and limit hospital visits.

I been saving up money for this device and I was planning on making an appointment with the private clinic staff to have his operation done this month.

My wife is 4 months pregnant and she's been asking when I was going to pay for a nursery room for our baby and complained that i was neglecting our baby and still haven't gotten anything for him.

She started showing me different nurseries online that she thought were nice and she went crazy about one of them that costs nearly 3.500 she insisted that I get it but I told her that the money is for my son's operation. She said that this is my son as well. She criticized the doctor's recommendations and said that doctors are now ""advertising"" for many insufficient devices just to get money out of it and brought up what happened with her deceased dad and how they took his money and didn't treat his condition. I told her to drop it and she threw a fit calling me stubborn.

My wife made dinner for us and seemed quieter than usual then she brought it up again. I told her to stop but she went on about her expectations for me to be a good father to our unborn son and how I'm neglecting him already. I didn't even finish dinner and before I went into the bedroom she told me that she already called the store and pre-ordered the nursery she liked and that I should know because I will be paying for it. 


I lost it I yelled at her for doing this after I already gave her my answer. I demanded she cancels the order and she yelled back that I was being unfair and will be an awful dad who already failed once and how sorry she feels for our son. She told me this in front of my son.

We argued back and forth. She ended up going to her family and she's been there for two days now. She mentioned that she won't return home until I decide to be fair to her and her son and stop disrespecting her.

It's 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms. Anna has been living here for 3 years and has had complete reign over everything there.

Our younger daughter, Melissa, 20F, aims to move out in the next couple of months to start school herself, starting January at the same school Anna goes to. Instead of having Melissa find an apartment on her own, we asked Anna if she could move in. Anna said no because she wants her own space, but we only asked out of courtesy: the answer is yes, Melissa is going to move in.

If Anna utilized all of the space this home affords her, we would have paid for an apartment for Melissa. However, Anna only uses one of the bedrooms (the others are storage at the moment), and the basement is completely empty. Melissa wants the basement in any case so it's not like Anna is sacrificing anything but her own privacy.

Anna's argument is that she loses privacy and autonomy as an adult living in the city. We don't see it as a big deal, plus we own the house and make all final decisions on it. Melissa is excited to not have to pay rent, in partial or in full. So everyone wins.

Finally, after she suggested it for like the fifth time, I said angrily, “I’m not going to listen to someone who’s not a doctor over my doctor”  Without another word, she collected her stuff and stormed out.

475,NTA,AITA for just wanting to have my goddamn coffee first before discussing the state of the world?,"My partner(38M) gets up on a weekend at 6 and watches the news in the open plan living room/kitchen. I avoid tv news as it increases my anxiety. I’m not avoiding what’s happening in the world but I prefer to read news. I don’t want the news on all the time like a permanent soundtrack to the year that is 2020.

If he’s watching it I’ll just put a podcast on. I get that it’s his routine - I just can’t talk about the news before coffee on a Sunday. But he’s been up a while and is waiting in the kitchen like a big news Labrador. 

This morning:

Pre-coffee me goes to make coffee. News is on. exchange normal affectionate morning pleasantries with News Labrador.

PCM: (puts kettle on) I’ll just put my podcast in if your watching. (Goes to put earphones in)

NL: don’t worry I’ll put it on mute. anyway nothing bad is happening this morning ...

PCM: that’s good

NL: ... And I can quickly paraphrase it

slight tension creeps into room. PCM adds coffee powder to cup. 

PCM: that’s ok

NL: its nothing bad

PCM: I know, I just don’t want to talk about the news. 

NL: but you don’t know what I was going to say. 

PCM: yeah I know, but it’s Sunday and I’m avoiding news. It makes me anxious.

NL: but what I was going to tell you wouldn’t  make you anxious 

PCM: I don’t want to talk about the news because it doesn’t help my mental health. 

NL: I don’t think it’s the news making you anxious.  you were anxious anyway.

PCM: (annoyed) yes I’m anxious. the news on a Sunday morning makes me more anxious. I wish you’d just believe what I’m telling you 

NL: alright you don’t need to get snappy with me. Anyway, did I try to tell you about the news?

PCM: just let me make my coffee

NL: did I try to tell you about the news?

PCM: (really snappy tone) News Labrador, just stop it.

Finishes making coffee in silence. NL Has A Face On. 

PCM: did you want to say something else? 

NL: I was having a really nice, joyful morning after an anxious week at work and then -

PCM: I’m expecting you to apologize actually, so we’re probably not on the same page about the conversation we just had. Have a think about it.” 

flees room with coffee on last word

my perspective - if i don’t want to hear about something and I say no politely that should be ok. I also didn’t like being told what is and isn’t making me anxious. 

NL perspective - he’s excited to tell me things, I was snappy and spoiled his morning. 

I feel bad for ruining his morning, but I think I’m right. However, we’ve all felt that solid conviction of I’M RIGHT followed by the slow sinking dread of - wait, fuck, it’s me. I’d like to know before we chat if I’m the AH, so I can apologize for my part without feeling like I’m undermining my quest to limit tv news in my life. AITA?

INFO: 

We have talked before about how I find tv news stressful, and talking about the news at times when it might overload me - like first getting up. He loves a good news rant and I don’t always have space for it. 

What he wanted to tell me was I think about Rishi Sunak and was covid19 or Brexit related. He was wanting to paraphrase the Andrew Marr show.  It was more that nothing new and terrible was happening than sharing something he was excited about. 

I do like him really I promise.

476,NTA,AITA For reporting my wife's cousin to his employer,"My wife's cousin is a sheriff's deputy in a southern US state.  He is in his mid-20s and I've known him for about a decade.  My wife and I live in a northern state, so I don't see him very often, usually just on Xmas or Thanksgiving.  I've never really had a problem with him, but for as long as I've known him he has struck me as entitled and naive. Becoming a cop has been his dream since before I knew him, and he's very proud of the fact that he achieved it.  Since we live so far away from most of my wife's family, there is a group chat with a lot of family members that people use to keep in touch. 

 Over the last year or so, my wife's cousin has a habit of posting videos and pictures of things related to his job that I disagree with.  Some of these include body cam footage of arrests, body cam footage of people in vulnerable or traumatic situations, and plenty of videos of insensitive jokes from him and other police officers.

Now, I'm no expert on police matters, but I'm pretty sure he shouldn't be sharing those things with people. Since it's not my family, I've kept my mouth shut to the group, but have told my wife privately that her cousin could probably get in trouble if he was found out for leaking these things to family members.  She said that her cousin is just very proud of being a cop and this is his way of looking for recognition and pats on the back because he has always needed to be praised. 

A couple weekends ago, he sent body cam footage of him and another officer mocking a person they were arresting for DUI. The things they said and the way they treated that man made me sick to my stomach.  It was like to them, this guy was less than human. They showed such a callous disregard for him as a person that for me, it was the last straw.  

I told my wife that since it was her family, I was going to give her a chance to say something to her cousin, otherwise I was going to contact his supervisor and let them know what he has been doing. She called her cousin to talk with him, but he literally laughed at her on the phone. He said these people are criminals so why should he give a crap what they think about how they are treated. After the call, my wife came to me and said her cousin is an a-hole and that its ok with her if I contacted his department.

So I looked up his department info, created an anonymous email, and sent over the whole collection of pictures and videos that the cousin ever sent out. After a couple back and forth emails from them asking questions about how I obtained those items, they thanked me for the information and I didn't hear back from them. A couple days later, my wife's aunt (cousin's mother) blew up the group chat looking for whoever contacted the sheriff because her son was now on (paid) suspension and desk duty.

I told them all it was me that did it.  Now my wife's entire family hates me and thinks I'm a huge a-hole. But my wife and I feel we did the right thing.",2020-11-16 16:16:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jv9irm/aita_for_reporting_my_wifes_cousin_to_his_employer/,640,12517,0.96,40
477,NTA,AITA for telling my parents I can't forgive my siblings for them?,"I am my parents only child. When I (21f) was a kid my half siblings from my moms first marriage did not take my arrival well. In part because their dad was an ass who didn't want my mom to remarry and poisoned them against me. In part because they thought it was gross that I wasn't their dads kid as well.

My mom actually let them go live with their dad after years of them acting out against me and my dad. They called us names, bullied me relentlessly and no amount of therapy and discipline helped. One time I was coloring a picture of my family and the oldest who was 13 at the time got into my face and told me to stop drawing us all because they hated me and didn't want someone gross like me being their family. My mom told him to apologize. He told her to get fucking rid of me. She took away all his stuff and sent him to his room. He blamed me. Told me if I had never been born his and my sisters life would have been better and that they and their dad used to pray together that I wouldn't be born. I was maybe like 5 at this point.

Another time my mom was trying to help the bond by taking one of them out with me at a time. And it was my mom, my sister and me this particular time. She wandered off repeatedly and said she didn't want to hang out with me. My mom tried really hard to get her to engage and we left when my sister found one of her friends there and told her I was still wetting the bed at 6 and wasn't I so gross. My mom punished her for that too. Again, it was seen as all my fault.

I think it might have been some after that when my mom agreed to let them stay with their dad. They still continued talking shit about me to their friends.

They invited mom to their birthdays and high school graduations but not me or my dad. I actually ended up with a lot of issues because of them. Low self esteem followed and I was bullied repeatedly in school. At first because of the esteem issues and then some kids knew my siblings didn't want me and used that to hurt me. At 16 I was diagnosed with depression and was in a really bad place.

I'm in a better place now and my siblings have apologized to my parents for how they acted. My parents want me to give them a chance to apologize to me and to be in my life. But I don't think I'll ever be able to. A lot of the stuff they said to me stuck in my head even more than a decade later. I do believe they might have grown and realized their dad was wrong to say and do what he did. 

My parents think I'm being unfair and have asked me to do it for them even if I don't want to do it for me or my siblings. I told them I can't.

478,NTA,AITA for banning my brother and his wife from coming on to my property?,"Three months ago, my wife and I bought my parents' property. There are two houses on the property, one that  my parents lived in and the other is a smaller house that my parents used to to rent out. When we bought the property, we moved into my parents' house and my parents moved into the smaller one. The houses are far back off the road. When you come down the driveway, you come to our house first and then my parents' house is further back.

The problem that we are having is that people, including my siblings like to speed down the driveway. Its a curvy driveway with pine trees lining it, so the visibility is restricted. Our worry is that someone would hit our kids when they are riding their bikes or would crash into us or someone else as they drive down the drive way. We put up a sign that says ""Children at play. Speed limit 5mph"", which has been very effective except for when it comes to two of my brothers and one of my SILs.  So, I put in a speed bump. That did the trick, although my brothers and SIL threw a fit.

Last month I was outside and saw my brother and SIL leaving my parents' house. They apparently didn't see me. My kids has some toys in our yard and my SIL (who was driving) drove into our yard and ran over the toys, breaking them. They then proceeded to laugh their heads off. They got back onto the driveway and that's when they noticed me. I texted my brother and he admitted that they did it because they are ticked about the speed bump.  I ended up banning them from the property. 

My mom asked me the other day if I would rethink our decision because she misses the grandkids coming over. So I called my brother and told him that he could come onto the property again but he had to park his car at the road and walk up. He angrily refused. My mom wants me to let him drive up but I honestly don't trust him or SIL. But at the same time, I feel bad because it's my mom and dad who are also being punished. So am I being the TA here?",2020-11-20 14:47:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jxqalv/aita_for_banning_my_brother_and_his_wife_from/,599,7060,0.98,6
479,NTA,"AITA for refusing to stay at home with my new baby, even though my husband is working 80 hour weeks so he can support us?","I was always clear with my husband Jeff that I love my job and have no desire to leave it for fulltime parenthood. He was always nothing but supportive, so that’s how we built our life plans. But once our daughter was born, Jeff did an immediate 180 and started asking when I was telling my boss I wasn’t coming back from maternity leave. I was dumbfounded by this, especially since Jeff didn’t make enough to support the family alone, which I was frank with him about. He kept saying he would figure it out and I needed to trust him and quit.

The week before I was set to go back to work, Jeff told me that he’d gotten a new job that paid enough to make up the difference from my salary, so I could finally quit my job without worrying about money. This was confusing for me because Jeff and I were making around the same amount of money, and I couldn’t imagine where he’d find a job that suddenly doubled his income. Turns out he's taken on an incredibly high stress position that requires about eighty hours a week. He basically sleeps and works, that’s it. There are lots of days when the only time I see him to bring him his meals, and he hasn’t spent more than ten minutes at a time with our daughter since taking the new job. Jeff is adamant that since he’s sacrificing so much to support us, I need to step up and quit my job so his crazy workload isn't for nothing. His industry is NOT supportive of job hopping, so he either has to stick with it for at least 18 months or leave his field entirely. He's livid with me and keeps saying that everyone in his life told him to prepare for me to refuse to go back to work, so he was just doing what he thought was right.

So far I’ve been standing firm. I planned out my adult life to be able to do this—work a flexible job from home while my mom helps with the baby during the day. I’m afraid to let Jeff force my hand into making a huge life decision just because he wants the huge life decision HE made without consulting me to be “worth it"". Our relationship so far has been nothing but loving and wonderful, and I'm completely shocked by how he's acting now.

My issue is that Jeff’s parents, brother, and best friend have all approached me about how miserable Jeff is and how if I don’t stay home with the baby, he's going to spiral into serious depression. Apparently all four of them had been whispering in Jeff’s ear during the pregnancy that I’d cave on wanting to work the moment I held our daughter, and they, too, think I’m selfish for not doing so. I have nothing but sympathy for Jeff and have supported him as much as I can—taking over all of his household responsibilities and doing my darndest to bring him some cheer while he’s working. But I fear the kind of precedent it will create in our marriage if I allow him to control me like this. My mom and best friend support me, but my sister and dad say that since the ""statistics"" are on Jeff’s side, I should do what’s best for him and the baby and leave my job.

480,NTA,Aita: For being mad at my wife for moving my son's stuff out of his room.?,"
I [M37] lost my son in 2016 from leukemia. I was a single parent and taking care of my sick son on my own with no one to show support or offer help. He passed away at the age of 11 he always loved sports such as hockey,soccer,and he used to decorate his room with sports posters on the wall/sports related toys in the shelves/and th st kind of stuff.

When he was in and out of at the hospital he'd decorate his room even though he had little energy he loved to do it and considered his room his safe place. This is hard for me to even talk about because whenever I walk into his room and see his touch in the room and I'd feel him near. This gives me comfort knowing my son had happy days even though there were few. His room is the same and I haven't moved anything I just leave it like it is not wanting to ruin it.


I been married to my wife for 3 months now, my stepdaughter moved in with us last month and my wife told me she didn't like her new bedroom at all. She saw my son's room several times and said it looked nice but I didn't think she wanted it.

I have three rooms in my house, and my stepdaughter started insisting on taking my son's bedroom. My wife asked if I wanted to change my mind but I told her that this is my son's room and it will stay this way. My stepdaughter didn't like that and took it as in I have no respect and consideration for her feelings. I already explained to her but she won't understand. Even though her room is the same size as my son's.

My wife wanted to give the room to her daughter seeing that it's the right thing to do and said that I was giving it too much thought. I told her no and that was it.

But yesterday. My stepdaughter called me and told me her mom was busy moving her stuff into my son's room. She probably thought that I knew so she was surprised that I was upset.

I got home and my wife told me that all my son's stuff are in the other her room and all she did was just switch rooms. I couldn't believe it when I saw my son's room upside down. I was so mad I told her she wasn't allowed to take the room without my consent and she said that I wasn't being supportive and a good parent to my stepdaughter when I'm behaving like this. I told her this had nothing to do with her it's about my son's memory. The room has been like this for years and for her to empty it and move out his stuff like that felt wrong to me no matter how she tries to explain it.

She and my stepdaughter are being quiet and my wife thinks I'm being selfish and unfair to my stepdaughter even though I helped organise her room when she first moved in.",2020-11-07 22:42:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jq01km/aita_for_being_mad_at_my_wife_for_moving_my_sons/,1135,11972,0.97,38
481,NTA,AITA for threatening to reveal my sister’s secret to her fiancé,"My (22F) sister (29F) has had a rocky relationship with her fiancé.

A while after they got back together she announced that she was pregnant. Anyways, she gave birth, everyone was happy etc.

Fast forward to three days ago, my sister and her fiancé announced their engagement but today my sister came over to talk to me, she was pretty upset and I was really concerned, it took her a while to tell me what was wrong and basically she told me that she doesn’t think her fiancé is the biological father of her baby because she had a one night stand like 2 or 3 days after they took the break in 2018 and her fiancé has no idea. 

I immediately encouraged her to just tell him because it’s pretty damn messed up but she’s refusing to, she keeps saying that it’s pointless and “why cause issues when everything is perfect right now.” So I told her that if she doesn’t tell her fiancé the truth I will. I cannot stand liars and that is one big lie, I think it’s super unfair to her fiancé. My sister called me a troublemaker and is refusing to answer my texts and calls. I have no idea what to do.

482,NTA,AITA for being angry my twin is taking over my college fund that I saved for med school?,"I (20F) always wanted to go to medical school. I worked extremely hard in high school, was accepted into an excellent uni, took the maximum credits per semester, and will be graduating one year early from undergraduate. I'm currently deciding where I want to apply for medical school.

My twin did well in high school and was accepted to a great liberal arts college, but never wanted to further his education beyond a Bachelor's degree. He's not as certain or as driven as I am about what he wants to do in the future, and is still exploring majors.

We each have our own college fund. They began with equal amounts. Both our universities charge tuition by the semester. I'm studying incredibly hard to shorten my undergraduate time so I can use the remainder of my college fund to help pay for med school and minimize the size of the loan I need to take out.

He can graduate in the standard 4 years easily by continuing at the same pace(3-4 courses a semester) or could even graduate a semester early due to the 30+ AP credits he has from high school. His friends at school have roped him into living the ""college experience"" and convinced him to  take extra semesters for easier course load(1-2 required classes per semester with a lot of electives). In short, he will need about 2 EXTRA years of university which will cost nearly $100K. My parents tried telling him that taking 5 or 6 years was unreasonable financially (a burnout/mental health gap year is an option because that doesn't cost money), but he just blocks their calls saying that he knew that they would say that because I've always been their favorite child.

When I graduate, I will have a substantial amount left in my fund on top of the money I get from my part-time job. Depending on the circumstances, I'm planning a one week DisneyWorld vacation after I graduate that I'll be paying for myself. (Edit: Clarification- I'm getting a part time job at the cafe next year to pay for it, not using my parents' money) My parents feel guilty and keep hinting that they want to use the money in my fund to help HIM pay for his undergraduate degree since he doesn't have a job or scholarships (I applied relentlessly since high school and enter competitions so I accumulated a few hundred dollars here and there, but it's not as if I have a full-ride to school- I have maybe $4-5k). They think that it's selfish that I'm flaunting DisneyWorld, and I could take out a loan for 100% of my medical school or wait a few years since it's not as necessary as a Bachelor's degree for him.

AITA for telling him he's a selfish brat and not taking any of my money? I don't think it's fair that I worked so hard since 9th grade to have him reap the rewards of my efforts. I'm incredibly angry and not talking to anyone at the moment, but my parents argue that it was their money in the first place and theirs to do as they wish and for me to not be feel entitled to their money.

TLDR: My twin and I have equal college funds. I'm working hard to graduate early and use the rest of the money for med school, he wants to chill and take a few extra years for the ""college experience"" by using my med school money. I said kick rocks.

483,NTA,AITA for making a disrespectful comment about God because my cousin wouldn’t shut up about my accident?,"I’ll admit I’m (M26) dealing with some heavy stuff right now. I was in an accident last December that killed my best friend &left me paralyzed from the waist down. This is a dramatic change in my life that I still struggle with, not being able to walk again, losing someone I love, dealing with survivors guilt and other emotional stuff that leaves me in a dark place.

Before this, I was never religious and neither is anyone in my family except my cousin. She’s tried for years to drag everyone to her church. 
It feels like ever since this happened, she’s used my accident to prove God is great because there was a high possibility I wasn’t going to make it and he “saved me.” It’s all she talks about with the family.

While dealing with all the physical and emotional trauma that comes with this, my cousin hasn’t stopped bothering me about going to church with her to thank god for this miracle, which still doesn’t feel like that to me but I’m trying to work that out in therapy.

I’ve told her *many* times that’s not my belief and church is the last place I want to be.

It’s got worse now that the church services are online so she literally comes to my place so we can watch together. I ask her to leave and it takes a few times until she does. 

I reached my breaking point last week when again she insisted when we were all having breakfast. At the table she talked about God having a plan and how sometimes he makes things happen *mentions my accident* so we can open our hearts to him. 

So I asked her, “you’re saying God’s plan was to almost have me killed and leave me in a wheelchair just so I could thank him for not killing me after all?” My cousin didn’t know how to answer that and I bitterly told her “no offense but *your* god sounds very toxic.”
A few of my cousins thought it was funny but everyone else didn’t know how to react. Then we just changed the subject but she didn’t talk anymore after that.

Ofc I get the txt from her about how she was just trying to help and she deserves an apology for being so disrespectful about her religion. Everyone is kind of annoyed with her too and my mom says she doesn’t like the way she’s been using my accident either. My dad feels I did go too far and should’ve just kept my mouth shut because in her mind, she believes she is in fact helping me.

I’m glad I at least have some peace since she’s not talking to me but she now she’s spreading word around that I insulted her when all she’s done at this point is “help” me through this period in my life.

484,NTA,AITA for “pushing” my opinion about my sister’s unwanted pregnancy?,"It’s a sensitive topic so I’ll be careful how I word things. I (27F) have a (technically half-) sister who is 18 and a senior in high school. She’s super bright, kind, and excels in sports, but she’s been making bad choices the past few years. She was suspended for a bit due to weed, she failed some classes, and she unfortunately got pregnant back in June. 

Her ex and his family wanted nothing to do with the pregnancy, especially since they come from a culture where marrying from another nationality is forbidden. She thought the baby had been conceived back in April, but she didn’t realize till late June and she’d been drinking and smoking heavily.

Our mom is very conservative so sister ended up asking me for help. She originally wanted to keep the baby, but I told her it would drop a nuclear bomb on her life. I pointed to our cousin who had a teen pregnancy that killed her college plans and relationship. I suggested abortion or adoption, and she was very reluctant to “have someone else take her kid.” With adoption ruled out I indicated her towards abortion. 

We went to the neighbor state so she could get a surgical abortion, and I paid. I thought all was good. 

But now she’s blowing up my phone about how I made her kill her baby and she’s going to tell our mom. I told her I didn’t make her do anything and she’s welcome to tell our mom, but it won’t go well. With thanksgiving coming up, we are going to see our little nieces, and I think that brings up some feelings for my sister. She also managed to get early admission to a college, she I think moving on with her future makes her feel guilty. 

AITA? I feel like I was honest with her, not pushy.

Edit: sorry for the delay in responding to questions. My sister came to me for advice, but at first I just explained the pros and cons of each option and had her make columns for each. She seemed to think that the courts could make her ex get back with her and be a dad/ breadwinner, so I explained how child support worked. The kid only makes $500 a month, so she’s hardly going to get rich off child support from him. 

Finally, she asked outright for me to imagine myself as her and tell her what I’d do. I said abortion. That’s when she agreed that it was best. 

Our mom would never let her go to therapy — she’d probably kick her out first. Mom is a Q person and very anti rational thinking in general. I agree that she shouldn’t be hosting thanksgiving, but it’s like talking to  a brick wall. The best I can do is refuse to go to it myself.",2020-11-22 19:21:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jz1kx1/aita_for_pushing_my_opinion_about_my_sisters/,552,5013,0.96,9
485,NTA,AITA for telling my husband he can’t come to my doctors appointments anymore until he goes to therapy,"I am 29 weeks pregnant with a baby boy. My husband and I were so excited when we found out because a few years ago we suffered an unfortunate loss of our baby at 24 week gestation. Our baby just wasn’t developing correctly and there was nothing we could do. It was just one of those sad things 

I went to therapy for it, and came to terms with it but my husband never did. As much as I asked and begged he didn’t. 

Now, every time we go to a doctor appointment, he essentially has a panic attack going, during and coming back talking about how we are going to lose this baby too. It’s been happening since we found out, so that’s 29 weeks of this. 


I go to doctors appointments fairly frequently due to some minor issues that have caused me to be considered high risk. 

After my last appointment while coming home my husband told me we should start considering the worst and looking into urns and cremation in case we lose this one too. 

This is where I told him he needed to go to therapy and I wouldn’t be having him come with me because he stresses me out and that’s not good for our (healthy) baby and for my blood pressure which is what is making me high risk until he does get therapy.

He told me I’m being unreasonable and he’s being realistic, and that I can’t stop him from going with me because it’s his baby too. This was last week and he has been cold and still hasn’t made a therapy appointment and honestly has been kind of hostile towards me. 

I know he’s just scared we’re going to lose our baby but having him with me is maybe the cause of what could make us lose our baby because he makes me so stressed

486,NTA,AITA for not buying my boyfriend a playstation after he refused to get me a Coach bag,"For my 22nd birthday in September I told my boyfriend (25M) about a specific Coach bag that I absolutely loved and I hinted that i wanted it for my birthday. My boyfriend told me that I was crazy for wanting something THAT expensive and he wasn’t going to spend almost $500 on a bag. To be clear - he isn’t financially unstable, he actually makes a decent amount of money. He just didn’t think it was reasonable to spend that much on a bag. I was honestly fine with this, i didn’t get upset or anything. It’s just a bag.

Fast forward to this week, my boyfriend keeps bringing up the new PS5 and he’s fully expecting me to purchase it for his birthday early next year. I absolutely cannot afford it. I work minimum wage whilst studying at university, if i blow that much money my bank account is going to suffer. Not to mention - why would he expect me to buy him a gaming console after he blatantly refused to buy me a Coach bag that is probably $200 cheaper than the PS5? I mentioned it to my boyfriend and he told me that there’s an enormous difference between a purse and a playstation and I can’t compare them, then he proceeded to call me immature.

487,NTA,WIBTA if I reported my daughter’s teacher for not pronouncing her name correctly?,"
My daughter’s English teacher refuses to pronounce her name correctly. 
She has a Japanese name and we live in Japan.  Her name is Kanae, pronounced Kaa-Naa-EH.
Recently, Kanae told me that her English teacher(an expat from America) at school calls her “Kah-Nye”. She told me that she told the teacher “My name Kanae. It’s three claps (syllables)”. But the English teacher told Kanae that she was incorrect, and that grammatically speaking that she , her teacher, was correct.
During my daughters sports day I “confronted” the teacher . I explained that my daughter would like the be called “Kaa-naa-eh”. But she laughed and said she was pronouncing it the way it’s “supposed to be” but will try her best to remember.
Today, my daughter told me the teacher still calls her Kah-Nye. My daughter is very very shy and it took a lot for her to correct her teacher the first time.  

I’m considering going to the school in the  morning. But is that an over reaction?



(For some clarity; I am not Japanese, my wife is so our kids are mixed-race. Our kids are fluent in English and Japanese. )

:::::oh wow! I wrote this late at night and went to sleep. I didn’t expect it to get this much attention! Thank you for all of the responses. I can’t reply to them all. But this morning we couldn’t go(son had an earache) but we are going there after school ends. We asked our daughter if she wanted us to tell. She said that she didn’t care.  We don’t want the teacher fired, we just want our daughter respected in her classroom::
⛩⛩
Update: I’m not sure where else to place it:::

But my wife and I went to the school today around 3:45pm. By then the English teacher in question had gone home. 
We told the principal everything that I’ve told you all and he was extremely apologetic. He did say that maybe it was a language barrier. But I reminded him that my daughter and I both told the teacher in English how to pronounce Kanae.

So then the principal called her dispatch company (Interac it turns out). The same thing happened. The company apologized but tried to pass it off as a language barrier thing.

More apologizes were issued when we told them
we spoke English. 

We were told that interac would speak to the teacher, and that they would handle it.

They principal asked us to come to the school Monday morning. I’m hoping to talk to the teacher face to face on that day.

❤️💚Final (maybe) update.  This morning I met with the school board, principal, the dispatch company, and the teacher in question! I honestly didn’t expect everyone there. 

It was very traditional Japanese apology. Deep bows from everyone (even the American teacher). She wrote (I think it was written for her because it didn’t sound natural and she made several mistakes)

I don’t remember it word for word but it said 

“ I sincerely apologize to the (our family name) and most sincerely to Kanae(she said it correctly). I now realize how important names are to the Japanese people. Please accept my dearest condolences(yes this was actually said).”
The teacher promised to treat Kanae with more respect.
She also apologized for not respecting me during the sports day. 

Honestly the only “real” thing that she said is when Kanae was brought in and the teacher kneeled down and said “Kanae. I am really sorry”. 
It seemed heartfelt 

Kanae being Kanae made the teacher a card

I forgive her.  So does my daughter. I have no idea what is going to happen career wise however.  Her company seemed very very upset.

But my daughter feels better

488,NTA,AITA for telling a woman where my baby came from,"I’m (27F) an Indian American woman. I was born and raised in America. A large majority of my childhood friends are Indian and I love to catch up with them. 

I’m the first of my friend group to have a baby. I was expected to be the last to have one, but life happens. I love her very very much and she’s the main focus of my friend group. Her father (38M) is white and my baby looks predominantly white. For reference, my skin is tan and lighter than some of my friends, but I still look very Indian. 

My friends and I decided to have an outdoor lunch together for the first time since February. I take covid very seriously because of my baby (now 6 months) but the cases in our area are very low and we all agreed to go to a place with less crowd. We were very safe. 

My friends and I were all sitting at a table and were having a great time. A white family later came to sit next to our table (still pretty far from us, more than 6 feet). 

My baby was laughing pretty loudly and babbling. She was being the happy little baby that she is. I had dressed her up in a lavender dress and she was wearing a little matching bonnet. 

A lady from that family noticed us and walked over to us, without a mask and pretty close to me and my baby. I immediately started to put a mask on my baby. 

She started talking to me and complimented my baby and then asked me where she came from. Her exact words were “How cute! That baby is just adorable! I just want to eat that little face up! Where did she come from?” 

I was so confused and put off by that question. I didn’t know what she was talking about and my immediate response was “Umm, well my vagina?”

My friends all looked so confused and irritated and we were just super awkward. The lady was offended and told me that I could’ve just told her that my baby was mine and I didn’t have to be so rude. 

She then huffed off and my friends and I were left pretty angry and confused. We carried on with our lunch and then when we were leaving, the lady’s husband and son walked up toward us and told us that we disrespected her and asked us if we had any lessons in basic manners. 

We didn’t say anything to them because frankly, we were scared. I’m putting this story here because I want to know if what I said was wrong and if I brought this situation on myself. AITA?

Edit: Wow, I’m overwhelmed with the response. I showed this post to my friends and we all laughed at some of the replies. 

In regards to my baby and the mask, I’m a new mother and I’m young, please cut me some slack. My boyfriend is the one who’s the baby expert and I try my best to keep up. I tried to do what was best to protect the baby but I hear that I was wrong. Baby doesn’t go out at all except to doctor visits and I only put a mask on her because of how close the lady was.",2020-10-28 23:08:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jjyeq3/aita_for_telling_a_woman_where_my_baby_came_from/,1753,18266,0.95,52
489,NTA,AITA for refusing to take my nephew in after his mother tried to trap me?,"I (23f) moved to the UK from Oman 2 years ago. Three weeks ago, i told my sister (30f) something I shouldn't have. I told her that I do not want to marry the man I was engaged to, because I have fallen in love with a woman (unimportant but no, she doesn't know and i won't tell her. I just don't want to marry him anymore).  I have always trusted her to have my back and she promised not to tell anyone. As you've probably guessed already, she did. To be specific, she told our parents before I had the chance to do so. She then lied to me and said that I had to go home to explain the situation in person. As it turns out, she and my parents were planning to take my passport from me and make me go through the ceremony anyway, and that they were arranging for therapy for my acting out. The only reason I have this information is because my grandmother called to tell me and made me promise not to go back. 


I always knew that this wasn't something they could support, but they always said that I would not be forced and that my feelings matter. I didn't think they would try to control my ability to travel.

I feel sad and terribly betrayed that I can't go home now.


Before all of this, when i moved away from home, the plan was that my husband and I would get settled, and that we would pursue permanent citizenship. After this, my sister's oldest son (11M) would come to live with us so that he can learn english and have better opportunities for the future. I was made a guardian for this purpose. When I found out what they were planning to do, I texted my sister and told her that I never wanted to speak to her again, and that I would not be coming home. She said that I was being selfish and not thinking about others, and that I was breaking my promise and ruining my nephew's chance at success. She said that if I don't come home and resolve the situation, our parents and her husband would never allow her or my nephew to travel either, but that if i settle down with my ex-fiance and show that I have improved my ways, they will forgive me and allow me to return with my nephew.
I told her that I had no interest in helping her anymore, even if it meant that my nephew might lose his chance. 

Today, i received messages from our parents and her husband saying that I am a terrible person for sabotaging her child's future, and that I owe them because they paid for me to come to this country so that I can improve the situation for our family, and that I need to return home so that they can help me honour my commitment.


I feel terrible about this because they have all helped me financially as an investment, and I am breaking a promise to a child who has done nothing wrong. At the same time, I do not think it is fair for my sister to hold me to a promise when she couldn't keep hers, especially when I am not the one refusing to let him come. ",2020-11-27 06:51:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k1w82d/aita_for_refusing_to_take_my_nephew_in_after_his/,364,5613,0.97,18
490,NTA,AITA for refusing to modify my house for my disabled tenant?,"Before you call me an AH, hear me out. I(21f) lived in a house with my disabled great aunt until about three years ago when she passed. She left me the deed to the house. I've been living in it ever since by myself. The house itself is a four-bedroom, three-bath, two-story house. My aunt had the downstairs modified to be wheelchair accessible when she became confined to a wheelchair, but she never bothered to fix up the 2nd floor because she never went up there because her room and office was downstairs. I eventually moved I at 14 and took over the upstairs.

When I lost my job because of covid, I decided to rent out the extra two rooms downstairs, because I don't use them. I was very reluctant about living with a stranger, but I needed the income. So I eventually found Brian (26m), who is in a wheelchair due to a car accident that left him paralyzed in his legs. He rented out both rooms, one for his bedroom and the other for an office.

I'm not going to lie, the fact that he's in a wheelchair makes me feel better about having a stranger living in the house. Because I know he can't hurt me. We've been living together since June, and we get along pretty well. He's a nice guy. But he's been hassling me about getting one of those chair things for the stairs so he can go to the second floor, but I've been refusing. I told him that the downstairs is wheelchair accessible so there's nothing he can get upstairs that he cant get downstairs and that the upstairs is my space and he doesn't have a right to go up there.

I think I'm NTA, but my brother disagrees. AITA?//

(edit. I do realize he could still hurt me, but it would be difficult.  He is totally paralyzed, absolutely no used in the legs. And while I bet he does have the arm strength, I'm a 150, 5'4 woman who was a powerlifter in high school. I could most definitely overpower him if need be. He is paying for the two rooms and use of the common areas (bathrooms, one guest, and one that is privately his, living room, kitchen, dining room, backyard,). Upstairs is my room, my office, my bathroom, and a small living room at the top of the stairs. I do keep a mini-fridge and a microwave upstairs just for those long nights where I don't feel like going downstairs.)",2020-11-04 05:22:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jnqvpa/aita_for_refusing_to_modify_my_house_for_my/,1330,12840,0.97,10
491,NTA,AITA for not removing butter from the breakfasts I make for my whole family?,"I'm a 16 year old girl, and I live with my parents and my two older brothers.

A couple of months ago, I decided I needed to gain some weight. I am technically underweight and honestly I didn't really like the way I looked or felt. I found a bunch of ways to add some more calories into my diet, and one of those was actually eating breakfast. In the past I rarely ate breakfast, and I never ate a breakfast that was a whole meal.

So I started cooking myself breakfast every day. Not only is it delicious and helps me gain weight, but I also enjoying relaxing in the morning by cooking something. I make a lot of different things, but to give you an idea, this past week I've made waffles, breakfast burritos, egg sandwiches, and oatmeal.

When I first started cooking breakfast, my parents and brothers (who work from home at the moment) asked me if I could make some for them too. I said sure because I was already cooking so it didn't bother me. Since then I've been making five portions of breakfast every morning, and everyone has been enjoying it. And I've gained five pounds!

About a week ago though, my parents and my oldest brother went on sort of a health kick. They decided they wanted to eat healthier and cut down on how much fat and sugar they were eating. That's not really what I need personally, but whatever, I don't care what they eat. They decided to swap out sugar with Stevia, buy these healthy yogurts with no sugar, and swap out butter with margarine. They also decided that they wouldn't cook with fats anymore, they would just use Pam.

My other brother and I don't follow any of these things. Personally I think I'm healthy enough, and the amount of sugar and butter I eat isn't going to kill me. So I still put sugar and butter into breakfast and cook with butter or oil too.

Yesterday, we were all eating breakfast, and my dad asked me what was in the waffles, so I told him flour, butter, sugar, etc. He seemed surprised and asked why I didn't just use the Stevia and margarine. I told him because I don't really like them and I'm trying to gain weight, so using low calorie alternatives doesn't seem like the best idea. Then my dad asked me if I could just switch to Pam when I cooked stuff, to reduce the calories a little. I told him absolutely not.

Since then, my mom and other brother have tried convincing me. I've told them no several times, and now they're angry that I won't compromise. I told them if they wanted to use their low calories stuff, they could cook themselves. They think I'm being inconsiderate of their health and that I'm just being rude. My dad even went so far as to threaten to stop buying sugar and butter if I wouldn't be more considerate of them. I think that if I do compromise, eventually they'll ask me to swap out more and more stuff until I'm barely eating more than before.

492,NTA,AITA for not trying to reunite my daughters?,"I have two daughters Kay (26) and Layla (22), As a single mum I tried my best for both of them. But Layla, while I love her, makes it very hard to do so at times. 

She’s always been attention seeking, stubborn, and jealous. We did family therapy and individual therapy for years  after her dad passed away when she was 9 but something snapped in her.

AITA part, when Kay was 22 (Layla 18 at the time) she had a boyfriend Mick (20), he seemed nice. Unfortunately Layla NEEDED all of his attention. It was constant, he’d be over at our house on couch watching a Movie with Kay and Layla had to be right there next to him. When they went out Layla chucked a fit if they didn’t invite her. She messaged him CONSTANTLY. 

She even went to his soccer games (skipping work at her job) when she hadn’t seen him in a while. Sending him pictures of herself, crying when I would ask her to get out Kay’s bedroom when they wanted to be alone.

I tried to put my foot down when Kay complained, I had a talk with Layla about boundaries and managing jealousy and how maybe we should got back to therapy. She didn’t want to listen and she was cold. She started getting more secretive and Mick started withdrawing, it was then I walked in on them on the couch when I got home from work. 

I’ll be real, I was not calm, I screamed, the whole neighbourhood could probably hear, I banned him from the house. I threw her clothes at her and told her to get to her room, I called Kay and asked her to come home. Mick must have gotten to her before me she came home a mess. 

It was one of the worst days on my life after loosing my husband honestly, my daughter was devastated and it was my other daughter that did it. Once Kay calmed down she asked me to take her to my moms house and I did. When I got back I went to talk to Layla, she was sobbing, saying I ruined everything. That I hated her, that I was always ruining her life, that they were meant to be together, I held her despite wanting to scream some sense into her. 

When the dust settled we talked, she fought any sort of blame, accusing her sister of abusing Mick, of Kay keeping them apart. As gently as possible I told her that while Mick is awful, what she did is also terrible. She needed to apologise. She refused.

That’s not even the half of it, but the relationship has been strained for the past few years. Kay has moved on and I am close with Kay and he’s husband, I’m careful to never talk about Layla and to be respectful of Kays boundaries. Layla however, begs for information about Kay, wants me to tell her everything, whines about how it was in the past, how she needs to get over it, I’m kinda ??? I just told her ‘what do you expect? You never apologised, what you did was wrong, I love you but I’m not the one to rebuild this relationship anymore, you’re not kids’.

She didn’t like that, and while I feel like I’m respecting Kay’s boundaries, even my mom says I need to try harder to reunite them, so AITA?


EDIT: for clarification on a few things, Kay asked to go her grandmothers after what happened. She couldn’t be in the same house as her sister, I couldn’t move Layla because she was locked up in her room. So Kay decided she needed to leave, this was in no way me dropping her off to comfort Layla. I got home at 1pm to find them and after Kay had come home soon after and I’d calmed her down she asked to spend some time at grandmas and I said yes, I was with her till 2am the next morning till she fell asleep between my mother and I. I left to go home, I checked on Layla, and I know I might be an AH, but she is my child too, she despite getting herself into this mess, was incredibly distressed. Maybe I was too gentile with her, maybe I should have yelled or gotten more angry. But In hindsight I don’t regret the decision to be there for both my daughters, when I looked at Kay I saw heart break and betrayal and when I saw Layla I saw a very scared, broken person. 

Kay made the decision to stay at her grandmothers, she did so for a little while, then I helped her move to her own place. I visited almost everyday, I went for dinners at her house. We had sleepovers, I went to doctors appointments with her, we started doing pottery together. I tried really hard to be good for her.

Layla has not been out of therapy for more than a few months since she was 10. Her diagnosis has always been unclear, but she does suffer from OCD, PTSD from her fathers passing and anger issues from when I last had anything to do with her therapy. Obviously she’s an adult, if she’s learnt anymore about her condition she hasn’t shared it. 

Layla moved out just before she turned 20, the year and a bit after what happened was very hard. Between trying to hold her accountable and not ruin what I had with Kay it was difficult. 

And finally, I never claimed to be perfect, I suffered a lot with post natal depression after both my girls and while when Layla was younger she did show signs of being harsh and unkind at times, I was working two jobs with a terminally ill husband. Maybe I didn’t pay enough attention to her, maybe therapy should have started sooner, I feel like there’s so much I could do better. And I wish I’d had their dad with me to help us. But it was just me and I did what felt right at the time. 

All in all this has felt extremely cathartic, and I wanna say thank you to everyone who cared to read and comment. I think it’s time I talked to someone myself.

493,NTA,AITA for avoiding my new coworker after she reported me to HR for having an inside joke about a straight male coworker having a boyfriend?,"I get how I'm probably the asshole for this, but I guess I just want to know what other people think.

My coworker Gio (40M) and I (30F) have worked together for 6 years and we are good friends. We have this running joke where the two of us refer to his former boss Drew as his boyfriend. Drew was a prick to everyone in their team except Gio, he gave him all the good accounts and he even endorsed Gio for a promotion even when Gio only met 70% of his targets. (I don’t begrudge Gio any of this since we didn’t even belong to the same team when Drew was his boss.) Drew is straight as an arrow, is notorious for being a womanizer and was fired last year for sexual harassment.

I should clarify that Gio and I refer to Drew as his boyfriend only when it’s the two of us who are talking, though our coworkers know the joke because we sometimes talk loudly. Gio is fine with our running joke and also refers to Drew as his boyfriend when we talk. For his birthday this year I photoshopped his and Drew’s faces into a gay couple’s picture and included it in my email greeting to him. He laughed at it for a good half a minute and then forwarded it to several coworkers who also got a kick from it. 

Our new coworker Kate, who has been with the company for 2 weeks, overhead one of my and Gio’s conversations where I called Drew Gio’s boyfriend so she thought Gio was gay. When she mentioned it to our other coworker Cory, Cory told her that Gio is straight, married and has kids, and the thing about Drew being Gio’s boyfriend is just a long-time inside joke between me and Gio. Kate went straight to HR to complain about me making jokes about Gio’s sexuality.

HR spoke to me and Gio, who told them that it was a long time inside joke between us that he took part of. I was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing, but it pissed me off that Kate didn’t even talk to Gio to ask if there was actually an issue. I’ve been avoiding her ever since because I honestly don’t know what I should even tell her after what she did. My boyfriend says I shouldn’t be angry at her because she was new and didn’t know our inside jokes yet, but my point is that while I understand that while Kate thought she was trying to do a good thing, Cory already told her it was a long-time running joke, and Kate didn’t even talk to Gio if her concern is something that she should really be concerned about.",2020-11-09 14:30:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jqyl61/aita_for_avoiding_my_new_coworker_after_she/,1203,6955,0.97,1

I look like a fucking child from behind and with my mask on its hard to tell from the front. I have people treat me very condescending because of my size. Because of my American husband I celebrate Thanksgiving. I'm actually just in it for the food because its as close to my mum's Sunday roast as I'll get this year since I won't be able to go home for Christmas as usual.

Anyway, my local Walmart is open now until 11pm and I got off work at 10pm. I had to get a few Thanksgiving extras, around twelve items. The store had already shut down the self-checkouts and had only three human-cashier lanes open. I got in one to wait. The store was quite dead being a small-town but I had gotten in behind a woman with two full carts so I had to wait a bit.

This older man, probably 50s, looking like what someone might refer to as a ""Redneck"" got in my line with a very full cart. The woman ahead of me was close to finishing at that point. The man looked at me in the fucking eyes and queue jumped. I'm not usually very confrontational but I told him I had been waiting first and he needed to get behind me.

Fucker looks me in the eye and tells me to fuck off, he isn't going to take orders from a kid, and that I shouldn't be in the store so late with my mum. He turned away and I was fuming. Anyway, he gets on his mobile and takes his hands off his cart. I grabbed thr fucking thing and gave it a good shove down the aisle, across the main walkway and into girls clothes.

He lit into me, cussing and whatnot, called me an alien, got in my face. He went to get his cart, I went ahead and unloaded my stuff on the belt. He got in a new line. When I got home and told my husband he told me next time to avoid starting drama and just let it go because it could have escalated. Apparently its unwise to confront people in our town at Walmart so late. My husband also made a point of saying that because I'm British and black someone might become dangerous.

We have two girls who are 9 and 5 and It's been very devastating and very difficult to be taking care of them while going through these tough times. My mom would help a lot and I'm so thankful for that.

My in-laws have been keeping to themselves but my brother in law would visit often to see the girls. He has always wanted kids on his own but hasn't been able to because his wife has medical issues.

He treats my girls well. And has been generous but treats me poorly and makes comments and criticizes my parenting often. He implied he wanted to be their guardian but I told him no.

He started demanding I bring the girls over to my in-laws house. And would get upset when I tell him I have work. He'd claim I'm clearly not taking care of the girls and don't fit to be a single parent.

We got into a huge argument after I told him I no longer will be welcoming him into my house because of his behavior. And he the reported me to CPS after I refused to let him into my house.

He claimed that I'm not taking good care of my girls needs/refusing to let them see their grandparents/being busy with work and other things I don't know about.

I had to deal with CPS once then after they did a surprise visit and thank goodness it went well although I was told to deal with some issues that are normal in every family.

I told my in-laws about what my brother in law did but didn't do anything. His wife was the one who told me eventually.


It's been over a month now. My inlaws are calling to tell me that i should let my brother see the girls after I told them that only them see my girls.

I refused to let him see the girls after what he did and the disrespect he shown but my in-laws are pressuring me saying these are their granddaughters and I have no right to act like this just out of spite.

Edit to say that the issues I'm dealing with are trying to balance my working hours with the time I spend with the girls. I have my mom either come over or take them to her house so I could pick them up after I get off work. Another thing is therapy and my girls are currently in therapy. I'm trying to take it slow but it's just so overwhelming and then to have to deal with my brother in law's behavior is just a lot for me and there isn't anything more I want than to spend time with my girls but I have to work since no one is willing to help with anything. I'm not the person who feels comfortable asking for help so I do all I can.

My brother in law says he wants to see the girls because it's been a while since he saw them and he misses them a lot but I don't want him around after what he did. I can't even look at him after this he made my grieve worse and I won't be able to forgive him soon.",2020-10-31 16:26:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jlla13/aita_for_not_letting_my_brother_in_law_see_my/,1364,19378,0.96,31
496,NTA,AITA for telling my co-worker why I don't use our company health insurance?,"I (F27) was having a casual conversation with a coworker (M50s) and he brought up that the enrollment period for our company insurance was coming to an end and asked me if I had finished signing up yet. I responded by saying ""Oh, I use my husband's insurance. Our company is opposed to reproductive rights and only covers birth control when mandated by law"". He said something along the lines of ""I guess you need some type of control"" and we moved on to talking about the technical work that we were doing.

Later in the afternoon I got an email from my boss (M26) and he said that I shouldn't talk about details of my personal life with my co-worker and it made people uncomfortable.

My thought is that equal rights only happen when people are willing to make it a part of mainstream conversation. AITA for responding truthfully, but possibly with a bit TMI to a conversation started by my co worker, or should I have just kept it at ""Oh, I use my husband's insurance"" and not finished the sentence?

Edit: There was one other person in the room when I made the comment (also M50s). My boss didn't say who, but my belief is that it is the other person in the room who made the complaint, not the one I was actually talking to.

Edit 2: Wow, a lot more attention than I thought. First, a lot of questions about my work. I work for a hospital owned by a catholic conglomerate that employs about 125k people. I accepted the job when it was my only career related option for work, and it can be hard to leave. I wish I could work for someone with all the same ideals as I have, but then I would probably just be self employed. There are several people in my department who are openly non christian religions, and LGBTQ+. Just because it is a catholic organization does not mean it directly reflects the views of many of the employees. 

I spoke with my boss today. He was promoted from being my co-worker about a month ago and is still semi transitioning into his first management job. He apologized for his email without discussing with me and I apologized for my combative tone in the work place. He mentioned that our company policy includes harassments to include conversations that make people uncomfortable when they are within ear shot even if they are not directed at them (which confirmed my suspicion) but also conceded that what I said would not be considered harassment. I apologized for taking such a combative stance and said I will try to be more cognizant of my tone and audience in the future. He said that he never made an official statement to HR and was addressing this as a disagreement between coworkers. I also believe my other coworker's statement was a sort of ""clumsy agreement"" with me as I saw in the comments, not an attack at me, so I did not mention it. I have a summary of our conversation in email and saved. I doubt he handled it the best or most officially, but in the interest of an amicable work place, I have left it at that, have my documentation, and don't intend to follow it any further on my end.",2020-11-10 00:10:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jr9w4h/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_why_i_dont_use_our/,811,13345,0.96,19
497,NTA,AITA for keeping my dead husband's name even though it makes my bf uncomfortable?,"Posting because I just saw something similar and I'm feeling really torn about this and want some outside advice. Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

When I was 19 I married my now deceased husband. We were married for 14 years and have 3 kids together who are now 7yo, 6yo and 4yo. He passed away 4 years ago. I took his last name when we got married and then went on to get my masters and PhD under that name as well as publish multiple well known journal articles and a book in my field as well as teach under that name. I'm now 37 and I've been using that name for almost half my life not to mention it is my children's name. 

However my new bf of 11 months doesn't like it. He thinks it disrespectful and hurtful to him to keep the last name of another man and has been pressuring me to revert back to my maiden name or take his last name. I don't want to do either of these things. We aren't planning on getting married(no tax benefits etc etc). But he is insistent, even pressuring me to change my children's names.

498,NTA,AITA for calling my stepmom's sister an attack dog?,"I (23F) have a godawful relationship with my stepmoms sister. We never got along. It took a turn for the awful when I was 9. My stepmom and dad wanted my stepmom to adopt me. I said no. They didn't listen and tried to push ahead with it, even going so far as planning a party to celebrate the approval of the adoption before anything was official. So they had everyone waiting at our house for when we got back from court with the go ahead. But I said I didn't want to be adopted to the judge and the judge respected that. My stepmom, dad and stepmom's sister all claim I humiliated her and made it awkward for everyone. The alternative, though, was to go ahead with an adoption I did not want and that was never going to happen.

Ever since my stepmoms sister has claimed I denied her sister the chance to be a mom. Honestly I usually respond sarcastically to it and brush it off but we do not like each other. She has claimed I'm so ungrateful when her sister has done so much for me and I could have done one thing to make her life by allowing her to adopt me and become a mom officially. I have told her it's none of her business, that she has no right to comment on my life. She doesn't like that. She believes she has a right because it's her sister I'm hurting with my rejection.

Once, about five years ago, I told her if she thought bullying me about it would make me love her sister or appreciate her then she was wrong. I told her it was annoying af.

Even though I cut her out after I was no longer living with my dad and stepmom she still tried to pester me about it. During lockdown she really got into it. She told me I was a bitch, I was acting like a brat, that I had no heart and all this other stuff. I told her to stop. I even said that she was acting more like a brat than I was by continuing the fight when I had made my position clear. It's not just her either. My stepmom is still doing what she can to get me to change my mind. It's just out of the two of them her sister is the more annoying and the outright bully.

So in August I kind of snapped and told my stepmom to call off her attack dog because she was crossing into the territory of being a stalker. This enraged the three of them (my dad, stepmom and her sister). They said I had no right to talk about her like that, said it was disgusting and I needed to apologize.

I don't think what I said was untrue. She does act like an attack dog. She's like Mr. Burns from The Simpsons releasing the hounds. But do you think what I said was a particularly AH move?

AITA?

BTW, please, please, regardless of whether you think I'm an asshole or not. Please do not call this woman my aunt. You can say whatever else you like but just, please.",2020-11-27 10:02:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k1yhna/aita_for_calling_my_stepmoms_sister_an_attack_dog/,383,4529,0.97,4
499,NTA,AITA for telling my friend that he is basically an employee of his dad and not a business owner like he says he is?,"My friend J comes from a wealthy family as his dad owns several successful businesses. He’s not a snob, but recently he’s become a bit preachy about how it’s better to be an entrepreneur than an employee. 

We’ve talked about it several times before. I’ve been working for a financial company for 9 years, and he always asks me about when I would put up my own business. I told him that I enjoy my current job because I get paid alright, have a great time with my coworkers and learn many things from my clients. J said that I’m wasting my time working for a company that pays me so little compared to what I could earn if were a business owner. I told him that I do have plans of having my own business someday, but that requires a large amount of capital and is a huge risk that I’m not yet comfortable taking. He said that I’ve been an employee for 9 years, so “If not now, when?” and that you can only get the reward if you take the risk. 

I usually try to brush things off because I know that J has good intentions, he’s just a little out of touch with how hard it can be to put up your own business and be successful at it, since his dad’s businesses have been there all his life. But the other day he was telling me about one of his cousins who asked for advice on college majors. He told me that he told his cousin to go for a business degree, work for two years to get some experience and then have his own business, just like J said he did. He also told his cousin to remember to aspire for greater things and not be satisfied with being an employee forever.

I was a bit irked about the last part and told him that hey, there’s nothing wrong with being an employee ‘forever’ and not everyone is cut to or wants to be a business owner. He said yes, there’s nothing wrong with being an employee forever, but if you’re smart or have any ambition, you would want to have your own business instead of working for someone else your whole life.

I told J that if he thinks that being a business owner is the best way to succeed financially, then why hasn’t he put up his own business? He said that he does have his own business, referring to the construction firm his dad founded which he now manages, and he doesn’t have to put up a new one since his family already has one in place. I asked how it’s his if he isn’t the registered owner, needs approval from his dad for all major decisions, and doesn’t control the company’s income. I said that he’s basically an employee who happens to be related to the owner and the monthly allowance he gets for running the business is his salary.

He didn’t reply to me after that and hasn’t talked to me since. AITA?",2020-11-08 14:01:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jqc6k0/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_he_is_basically/,742,19601,0.98,25

501,NTA,AITA for trying to convince my sister to not name her baby a ridiculous name,"My sister (19F) is eight months pregnant, she told me a few weeks ago that she thinks she wants to name her baby boy 'Paradox.' PURELY because it sounds cool and it's unique. I honest to god thought she was joking. Ever since then I've been texting her a bunch of names, hoping that she'll pick a different one. Yesterday she got super annoyed and asked me why I kept suggesting names when she already picked the name so I had to be honest and I told her that Paradox is not a real name and she and her son are gonna be mocked. I've genuinely been stressing out about it because I know she is making a MASSIVE mistake. Now she has blocked me on everything and is refusing to acknowledge my existence. 

I asked my mum what she thought and she agrees that the name is ""a little out there"" but it's my sister's choice at the end of the day.

502,NTA,AITA Because a coworker was fired for organizing and cleaning my desk without my permission?,"Yes you read that right. People are mad at me at work. Let me explain.
So we all have cubicles with high walls that are textured where you can hang things. I suck at decor. While some coworkers including this lady kept their spaces looking like hotel rooms or whatever, mine wasn't bad but it was busy. It was set up so I could find everything I needed for work.

Well one day I come into work and all my papers are things were gone. I look in my cabinets and everything is neatly tucked away. I was a little taken aback and offended. I get to work an hour early so I immediately start searching for everything and putting everything back.

While im looking someone who is higher up, like an assistant manager walks by...whats strange is
1. Shes early too
2. She was walking all the way on my side of the floor where her desk is many rows from mine

So i really think she was there because she saw something after i left the night before
She asks me whats wrong. I tell her someone moved all my stuff. She then tells me to write the director about it.

So i write the email.

Remember, management APPROACHED me. I didn't go running to them.

I proceed to work. The lady comes in and doesn't say anything to me. At the end of the day I look in her cubicle and its cleaned out.

Now people are saying i got her fired. She talked to another coworker claiming she was only trying to help. Keep in mind i never asked her to clean my desk and she never asked me to clean my own desk either. Management is always putting out emails about cleanliness. People eat and leave food for days. When the director called me into her office she made a point of telling me my desk was fine. She said the situation had been handled. I never asked for this lady to be fired. I also had no idea who did it. People saw her.

Nows she fired and people blame me. AITA?

also..this lady wasnt a very good employee overall. She argued with customers and management a lot. She had the rules changed regarding cell phones because she kept FaceTiming her kids while at her desk.

Edit for clarity:
The assistant manager approached me and asked me to write an email about what happened to my desk. 

At the time of writing the email, I didn't know who had tampered with my things and no one told me. Actually no one told me she cleaned my desk, either.  I put two and two together on the spot because she sat right next to me and would have looked at my desk everyday.

This lady was annoying in other ways. I have an earlier schedule than her and i remember her coming in and basically forcing me to say good mornings to her even while i was talking to a customer.

It was confirmed she was the culprit when other coworkers complained to me and told me the lady said she was only trying to help.

I wasnt concerned about sensitive information on the desk but the job requires knowing a lot of information and she pulled all of my resources i used often during the day.",2020-11-10 01:28:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jrb9ie/aita_because_a_coworker_was_fired_for_organizing/,775,14049,0.96,12

504,NTA,AITA for adding coffee to brownies despite my Dad hating coffee?,"I’m a teenager, and during COVID while I was at home I began to learn baking as a way to relieve stress. One of my favorite desserts is brownies. I started with a very basic brownie recipe, but slowly I’ve made it more and more elaborate to achieve ultimate chocolate fudge status. 

I do not really bake with anyone else in mind. I just like trying recipes. Most of the time it’s a treat everyone can enjoy, but sometimes one of my three family members won’t like what I made.

At some point along the way, I watched a 100-hour brownie recipe and got the idea to start adding decaf coffee (I can’t do caffeine for other reasons). I tried it, it was delicious, and my mother and brother absolutely loved it. My father didn’t know what it was and ate them too, but when I revealed my “secret ingredient” was coffee, he got really upset. 

Ever since then, every time I make brownies he asks me to take the coffee out. I tell him no because it’s my recipe (that’s the part where I might be a total AH—I’m kind of stubborn about it). It’s not like it stops him from eating them. He ate 1/2 of a 9” pan in less than 24 hours last time (with coffee). 

Last night my college quarter ended, so I specifically made MYSELF a pan of brownies in celebration. Of course, everyone was welcome to share my celebration. 

For some reason, that particular night my dad simply got absolutely ticked that I wanted to add coffee—a little more of it, actually, and some dark chocolate, since that’s really what I’ve wanted to do. I tried to reason out that these were brownies for me really, but he just got more and more angry (I want to say whiny, but that feels mean). 

I added extra coffee anyway and baked them. Pure chocolate heaven! Best brownies yet. Denser than a black hole. Delicious. 

This morning he was very upset because he tasted the coffee and told me he was hurt. He then took 3 brownies from the pan and returned to his office (I’m not shoving them down his throat..?). 

Someone told me to just separate the batter into 2 bowls and bake them with and without coffee, but I usually can’t afford to double the recipe and I don’t have half pans. I also don’t want to end up in my mom’s conundrum—when she cooks, she almost always has to prepare two separate dinners (one for the rest of us, one for my dad without spices/onions/‘weird sauce’ and usually more centered around cheese/Taco Bell fire sauce/tortillas. Basically everything is a burrito). My brother and I help her out with cutting and prepping dinner since we’ve both gotten into cooking (and helped her get over her fear of us holding knives—thanks Food Network!). Still, though, it’s tedious to make a Bland and Good variations of a dish every time. Also doubles the leftover containers. 

AITA for adding coffee to my brownies knowing that my Dad (1 of 3 other people in my house) hates coffee?

505,NTA,AITA for Saying I Don't Care that a Little Girls Grandma Died?,"So I(38F) have 5 kids, all internationally adopted as I am infertile. This in particular is about one of my daughters (9f), I will call her Zoey as it starts with the same letter as her real name.

Zoey just entered 4th grade, she's going to school in person this year. Well one girl(I'll call her Cat) has been picking on Zoey a lot. I'm not one of those moms who makes a huge fuss over evrey little squabble. Cat has picked on Zoey for being adopted, being asian and started rumors that she has the virus. Every time Zoey tries to tell her teacher, her teacher either brushes it off as a ""conflict"" or says that Cat is dealing with a lot and not to mind her even though that is very hard for Zoey.

I have learned with one of my older kids to document every incident of bullying that happens to my child, I just write down the date and what they say happened in a notebook. It usually turns out to be nothing.

I have done this for what Zoey has said about Cat. Well last week was the final straw. I got called by the nurse that Zoey had fallen out of a tree at recess and hurt her arm and she had to go to urgent care. I picked her up as soon as I could. When we got in the car she said what really happened was Cat told her if she climbed up the tree she would let her sit on the class bean bag or something like that. When Zoey did it Cat began shaking the other end of it. When Zoey fell out of the tree Cat ran away. When her teacher got there she tried to tell him what happened but he scolded her for climbing up there (granted he didn't know how bad it was) and took her to the nurse.

Her wrist was broken because I guess she tried to catch herself from falling and ended up twisting it backwards. After she was home with my husband I marched into that school p\*ssed off. I ended up having a meeting with the guidance counselor and her teacher. Her teacher kept trying to call it a fight or conflict(giving them equal blame basically) or saying that she shouldn't have climbed the tree in the first place. Then he said that in the beginning of the year Cats parents told him that her grandma died over the summer so cut her a little slack.

I said I didn't care and she should still be punished. He seemed shocked that I said I didn't care. We has all this week off so I've taken a little time to cool off and now I'm not sure if I'm TA for saying that. AITA?

506,NTA,AITA for being upset that my older sister told my mom about her pregnancy and plan for abortion at my wedding rehearsal dinner,"I got married last weekend and have been waiting to post this in case my feelings subsided but I’m still pretty upset. 

Last Friday at my rehearsal dinner, which wasn’t even really a rehearsal dinner, just my family and my in laws getting dinner together after pre wedding preparation (girls getting their nails done, men getting beards trimmed and haircuts etc) my sister asked my parents to go outside with her and apparently told them she was pregnant and planned on getting an abortion. 

I could tell they were noticeably upset when they came back, but that was common after conversations with my sister, because she was a little bit of a wild card.

The following day, my wedding day my mom and sister were very distant and whispering to each other throughout my getting ready, and also spent most of my reception doing the same thing, just this time with my dad. My father missed our father daughter dance and none of my family made a toast or any sort of acknowledgment really that I had gotten married. 

I waited until the end of the reception and asked them what was up? My sister told me she was pregnant and getting an abortion on the 20th.

I responded negatively, and got angry that she told our parents this at my wedding, and then got angry at my parents for ignoring me my whole wedding, missing our dance and not getting any photos together. I got my husband and we left, and I got calls and texts saying I was being incredibly selfish and that my sister needed their support. 

Aita?


Edit: I don’t want any prolifers coming to message me about my sisters getting an abortion. I am pro choice and 100% support her. I am upset over her choice to tell our family at my wedding. Not upset over her making a decision for her own body.

507,NTA,AITA for telling my sister reddit's favorite ''play stupid games and win stupid prizes''?,"My(24f) sister(27f) is the golden child, she always gets her way at anything she wants if our parents can give it to her, clothes, college, car, phone, anything she asks for and it doesn't matter if something is left for us or not, this turned my sister into a total ranging bitch whom everyone hates, and when I say everyone is everyone, she already has 3 divorces at 27, she doesn't have any friends, our cousins are uncles would rather not come if she's here, and well, she hates us too, but me especially since I'm the only other daughter that my parents have, they don't love me as much like her it's pretty obvious, but my brothers do and she despises me for that

One of the things that drive her crazy more than anything it's our career, we are both architects, I studied it because I've always been interested in it and she did it to spite me, she tried to force me to get into another one because she wanted to be ''the only architect in the family'', I put my foot down and said that she was no one to force anything and that I was going to study any shit that I wanted, needless to say, my parents stopped talking to me for a whole month and my older brother paid for my first year since they retained my college fund.

Even when she went into a much better college, I got my info sent to an important architectural office by one of my teachers, they contacted me and set an interview. I knew I shouldn't have said anything, but I was so, so proud that I called my parents to let them know, they acted happy for me smooched all the info and when I was done, they told me to let my sister go instead of me and that I could get something else I said obviously no and they tried to guilt-trip me by saying that I already stole her career and that I couldn't do the same with her job, I just snorted and hanged up.

I thought that they would drop it but when I presented to my interview they told me that (myname) had already come, broke some expensive shit and threatened to sue them for sexual harassment while they dragged her to the exit, I was confused because I didn't do any of that and showed them my ID, my papers and the recommendation letter from my teacher, it turned out that my sister was the one who came to the interview and when they didn't let her pass because my appointment was later she went bat-shit crazy and ran when they were calling the police, I was so ashamed and enraged that I gave them her whole info and they sent a police officer to our house to get her arrested for property damage and fraud, my parents obviously helped her out and when she got out of jail my parents demanded an apology, I just said ''play stupid games and win stupid prizes'', my parents kicked me out because I got her arrested and made fun of her, I moved with my brother and got the job.

I found this a bit offensive and asked him to please not talk about girls negatively in the future. He argued it was not offensive because girls scream more than boys. I said four year-old boys scream just as much/loudly as girls. He said well they shouldn't. I said that's archaic and sexist.

What started out as a small argument has snowballed into a big fight, we hardly spoke the whole day and he has just told me I was rude and condescending to him this morning for calling him sexist and he expects an apology.

509,NTA,AITA for not letting my son's biological father meet my son?,"This is a throwaway account and I am on phone.

I (21F) got pregnant at the age of 16 by a 18 year old. 

The biological father of my child (Dave) didn't want any responsibility of the child and ended up signing his parental rights away. 

My parents kicked me out when they found out I was pregnant and I had to go through my pregnancy all alone in not very great conditions. I asked Dave for some financial help which he refused even though he comes from a well off family.

Recently, Dave contacted me and showed interest in actually meeting my son which I refused as he doesn't live in the same country. His life is in shambles and he is still not sure if he wants to dedicate his whole life to my son. He just wants my son to know that he is his father.

My son and I don't have any other family other than each other and I don't wish for him to actually get connected with him and for him to then decide that he is still not ready. 

He legally can not do anything but now he calls me everyday and sends me case study of peoples experience growing up without a father.

AITA for not allowing my son's biological father to meet him?

Update:- Thanks to everyone who commented and I am sorry I could not go through every comment.

I have decided to not let Dave in my son's life at this present moment but when my child grows old enough to actually make the decision, he can decided if he wants to meet Dave or not.

Some people pointed out how my child may think I am an asshole when he grows up and to be honest if me being an asshole provides him a stable and great childhood. I don't mind being an asshole at all

510,NTA,AITA for offering to pay for my nieces school tuitions but refusing the wire the money directly to my sister (their mom)?,"I’ll keep some things vague, general issue is the same though.

So I’ve got two nieces currently in a private elementary school. I’ve been paying for their school tuition since they started school, roughly a few thousand a year, because I’m a single woman without kids or dependents and I’m happy to support them. My younger sister (their mom) has been happy to let me pay because their public school district is fairly bad.

Anyways, the kids will be moving into middle school next year which means tuition will increase by half, then another half by the time they’re in high school. My sister now wants me to wire that tuition money directly into her accounts, so that she can pay the school herself.

I don’t feel comfortable with this because I’m currently paying the school through a special portal that lets non-parents/guardians pay tuition directly to the school, and we get individual confirmation on where the money goes. It’s secure, easy, and transparent for my own financial records too. 

I love my sister but she has been destructively financially irresponsible in the past and the large sum that will be their tuitions in middle/high school is a LOT to transfer to one person at a time. Also, she recently started dating a somewhat sketchy man who heavily pushes her to demand this from me, so I am just paranoid as heck but I’m not sure if I’m overreacting. 

So now we’re fighting over this, because I said I’d prefer to keep using the portal, and my sister thinks I’m insulting her rights as a mother to oversee her kids’ finances. I’m feeling deeply conflicted on how I should approach this. Sure it’s my money, but it’s also her kids. 

AITA if I refuse to wire her money directly instead opting to pay the schools myself? It’s caused a big rift and I’m trying to respect everyone’s boundaries at the same time.",2020-11-25 03:49:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k0kjg7/aita_for_offering_to_pay_for_my_nieces_school/,532,2604,0.98,10
511,NTA,AITA for not inviting my uncle’s girlfriend and her kid to my wedding?,"We’ve never like my uncle’s girlfriend, Sandy, or her 12 year old kid, Amy. Sandy has the exclusive right to parent my uncle’s kids without question, but if my uncle even asks Amy to sit down for dinner she goes crying to her mom and my uncle is getting lectured on boundaries, how she’s not his kid. Amy is a mini Sandy, full of herself and has to insert herself in everything. First month they were dating we did family pictures. Nobody knew who Sandy or Amy were when they showed up for the pictures. We politely asked them if we could get just family pictures first. My grandma just wanted pictures with her kids and grandkids, not even my father was in the pictures and my mom and him have been together for almost 40 years. Sandy threw a fit claiming she was being alienated by my grandma and that my grandma is  just of her because my uncle is dating her not my grandma (what??? Why would my grandma want to date her son???). Then a couple of months later Sandy starts showing up almost everywhere my grandma went (she lived alone in a different state for the first few months of quarantine)! Grandma had to go get groceries at Costco? Sandy was there “thinking about applying for a membership”. My grandma had to go to the pharmacy? Oh what a coincidence, “the other pharmacy didn’t have my medication” so she had to go to the one 35 minutes away that’s in my grandmas town. Anyway, onto Thanksgiving Day’s events. All of us decided to hop on Zoom so we could have thanksgiving dinner “together” when my uncle started getting tons of phone calls and texts causing him to step away. When he came back he said “sorry that was Sandy and Amy, they’re upset they weren’t invited so I sent them the link.” Now, we did this for 2 reasons, 1) they’re both self centered, and 2) Sandy is still married and living with her husband who also joins the call. First we hear Amy crying and screaming in the background like a 2 year old having a tantrum, then Sandy starts screaming at us calling us selfish bastards, and then to top it off HER HUSBAND starts laying into us about disrespecting “his wife”. Before you ask, no, they’re apparently not in an open relationship; Sandy and her husband allegedly just want the benefits. Anyway, my grandma, being the savage little old lady she is, pipes up saying “See? This is why nobody here like you. This is why we do everything without you. This is my I’m so glad that you and that rabid kid of yours aren’t invited to my granddaughter’s wedding.” From there all hell broke loose and there was even more crying from Amy, and Sandy started to cry saying that we’re “targeting her” and so on. My wedding isn’t for over a year, so if she turned her attitude around even to be pleasant, she’d be invited to keep peace. So, AITA for not inviting my uncle’s girlfriend to my wedding?

512,NTA,AITA for not sharing my kid's college funds with my sister kids?,"Me(36F) and my twin sister Amanda(36F) were the stereotypical daddy's girl, we were very attached to our dad, he was a ''super dad'' (the most present dad possible without being controlling or annoying). Dad's family came from old-money, he is filthy-rich(close to billions). Growing up he spoiled me, Amanda, and my two other brothers a lot, we came from a VERY privileged family.

One thing about dad is that he really loves weddings, he is a bit of a romantic and very traditional in that sense, and growing up we always remember him saying that ''he couldn't wait for the day to walk down his little princesses down the aisle'' it was a pretty huge thing for him. When my older brother(41M) got married on his one year anniversary in 2011 dad gave him a house as a wedding anniversary gift, it was a pretty huge and expensive house (close to $3million) and started a tradition in our family, my younger brother got the same thing. When I got married in 2018 my dad was really thrilled about the whole thing he gave me a blank check for the ceremony (my brothers got the same deal) and it was beautiful, he walked me down the aisle and was really emotional about it, one of the few times I saw him cry, I receive a house in my first wedding anniversary.

When Amy got engaged dad was really excited too, one week before the wedding Amy drops the bomb, she was going to walk down the aisle alone, dad was really sad with this whole thing but she said that ''she wasn't anyone property to be given away'','' that she was independent grown-ass woman''(true, she is more independent than I will ever be), ''that this was a misogynistic tradition that she wouldn't want to participate in'', despite dad begging her she didn't kneel, dad paid for the whole wedding, she offered him the traditional father-daughter dance but he refused his logic was that ''if you don't want me to act like your father in a traditional way, I won't''. 

Skip to one year after the wedding, dad didn't give Amy anything, when she confronted him about it he gave her a receipt for a donation of $3 million to the National Women's Law Center (Amy is a lawyer) in her name she tried to argue but couldn't really say anything. When my and my other brother's kids were born dad started a college fund for each one of them (it's supposed to achieve $2million when they reach 18), last week Amy discovered about the funds and ask dad about it (she has 3 kids 7F,5F,2F), apparently dad has been giving the money that was supposed to go her daughter's to the NWLC to help other ''independent grown-ass woman like her''. Amy is furious at our dad and they currently not speaking right now, she asked us (me and our other brothers) to share our kid's college fund with her kids because ''dad is a mean cunt and is punishing her kids'', we refused because it's not like our kids are getting the money that was supposed to go to her kids, she is giving us the silent treatment since them.

513,NTA,"AITA for making my niece a ""gay"" blanket?","I(26f), sew im my spare time. Usually blankets and quilts and I usually give them to family for xmas/birthdays. 

My 31m brother recently asked me to make his daughter(4) a replacement quilt. The one I gave her as a baby which was violet and indigo was too small and her larger orange and red one had been scratched by their cat. I said sure and offered to combine the bits that were salvageable from her other quilts in order to save on buying new material and so the old quilts didn't go to waste. They said sure. 

I asked my niece if she had any other colours she wanted included and she said blue. I was stumped for a while on how to combine blue, indigo, violet, orange and red until I realized they were the colours of the rainbow and one of her toy ponies tails so I decided to make a rainbow swirl pattern quilt. 

At no point did I consider that it could be see as ""gay"" and foolishly didn't consider that my (catholic) brother might not like it. Lo and behold he didn't.

514,NTA,AITA for holding my stepsister's mother's ashes until she returns my dog to me?,"Throwaway because this whole drama is stupid, I am ashamed of it.

I(20F) was temporarily living with my mother, stepfather and stepsister(14). Me and stepsister were never close, she hates me and my mother, thinking that my mother ""stole"" her father away after her own mother passed. It has been that way for 4 years already and while she is in slightly better terms with my mother, she still constantly tries to disturb me because I am not as tolerant as my mother. As for my stepfather, he is quite okay but he would pretend to ignore me in front of my stepsister sometimes because she would throw a fuss about it.

I was supposed to move to a rather far place to work and study. My father arranged for me to move in after renovations are done, bringing my dog with me. When I first brought my dog to my mother's a few months ago my stepsister seemingly fell in love with him. At first it was just me taking care of him, then we took turns taking him out, for a while I even thought that we could have gotten along better because we both love the dog. 

And one day my sister returned without my dog and announced that she had given him away, just to spite me. She got what she wanted and no matter how nicely or nastily I asked her she wouldn't tell me where she took him. I complained it to my mother and stepfather but they couldn't get her to talk either, she had this attitude of ""try me"" whenever she gets stubborn. I was to move in 2 days and I guess she wanted to keep my dog for herself or make me miss my cross country train.

I know it is despicable, but I was worried for my pup and whatever she could have done with him. I sneaked into her room when she was not looking and took her mother's ash urn, I know this was precious to her, precious enough to be used to make her talk. I hid the urn somewhere she would never find.

Sure enough, my stepsister lost it completely when she realized what I did, and similarly I'd never talk no matter what my mother or stepfather say. After all those screaming and crying she finally gave in and admitted that she brought him to her friend's. After taking the trip and passing my dog back to me, she demanded to have the urn back but I did not tell her until my day of departure, in case she wanted to pull some sick prank again.

Everybody I know of, including my own father, thinks that I took it too far. While in the end nothing really bad happened, I did it in the worst way possible(quoted by my mother, who did nothing to help either). It was my stepsister who started it, she knew how important my pup is to me and she tried to take him away from me, so I used similar way to make her return him and it worked. I didn't do it out of spite, just making use of what I could to get my dog back. So in this case, AITA?",2020-10-30 09:36:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jktpyb/aita_for_holding_my_stepsisters_mothers_ashes/,1407,16363,0.97,64
515,NTA,AITA For giving my son’s girlfriend a list of requirements if they’re going to receive financial support from me after I was given a list of requirements to see their baby?,"I’m 49F and I have a son 21M and his girlfriend 21F. His girlfriend is pregnant and because they are in a rough patch, both of them also dropped out of school. I’ve been helping them out with money.

For the most part I like his girlfriend well enough, but she’s been a bit overbearing during this pregnancy. Not that I really blame her.

Today they came over and his girlfriend decided to give a list of “dos and don’ts” to my husband and I if we wanted to have contact with their child. The list was mostly reasonable (have vaccines, don’t swear around the baby, handle baby with care, don’t show up unannounced, no sexism/racism and any sort of -ism around the kid etc). Some of them were a bit overbearing (when the baby is older no tickling or sweets, no cartoons, no baby talk etc). I took issues with this for two reasons:

1) It seems insulting and condescending. Some of the items on the list are things we would never do (like the racism and sexism one struck me as really odd). We’re also not anti-vaxxers. It feels like she was pretty much assuming the worst of us (ex of course we wouldn’t swear like a sailor around a child!). And we always call before we visit, they show up unannounced more than us!

2) Some of the items on the list are extreme. I understand that these are her rules and how she plans to raise the baby, but the idea that I would lose access to my grandchild because I baked cookies with them is extreme and I don’t want to walk on eggshells or go through the hurt of losing my grandchild. Especially since I feel like it’s the grandparents job to spoil the child (within reason of course)

(To clarify, I understand how these requirements could be necessary - if we weren’t suited to be around children I would understand).

So in response I said fine, but now here’s a list of requirements to receive financial support. In the past we’ve always trusted them and given them a monthly allowance. As long as we didn’t think they were deceiving us or blowing money or asking for even more we let them do what they will with the money. So I added the stipulations like wanting to see their budget to ensure they didn’t 1) eat out 2) buy unnecessary clothing 3) didn’t go to hair salons instead of barbers 4) had to spend a certain amount on the baby 5) didn’t buy hobby-related stuff etc.  And finally, financial support would be lost if we were to be denied access to the baby. There were more stipulations but I’m sure you get the point.

I made this list and gave it to both of them in exchange for the list of the baby requirements. Both my son and his girlfriend were upset with this. I said that previously I had trusted them, but since you didn’t trust us we wouldn’t trust them. I also told them how disrespectful I thought they were for giving me a list when they rely on my husband and I for support.

His girlfriend said I wouldn’t be able to see the baby. I told them they could leave. My husband and I are both conflicted over this and I’m wondering if I overreacted. AITA?

Edit: To all of you who are sending me messages hoping I die and saying you’re happy I’ll never see my grandchild, or calling my DIL a sl*t for having an accidental pregnancy, why don’t you say those things in the comments instead of hiding in my inbox?

Edit2: I thought I would add a mini update. It looks like the very top reply is NTA but there is a great deal of ESH and YTA’s. I can acknowledge that a discussion would have been a better approach, however at the time I felt like I had just been slapped in the face which is why I reacted the way I did.

I have had some time to reflect, but right now I am still more upset that in response to conflict, my DIL and son both reacted by saying I will never see their child. I can possibly forgive them for the list as being overly cautious parents, but I’m not going to tolerate them threatening no contact over any conflict or using it as a control method. It would be too hurtful for myself. Some of you have accused my list as being petty, which maybe it was, but truly I was being defensive more than anything. I will not leave myself open to emotional manipulation, and I plan on making that very clear to my DIL.

I do plan on talking to my son and DIL and going from there. I’m just going to wait though, as I want to be in a clear frame of mind and right now I am still very hurt and angry at them. Hopefully in a day or two we will be in a position where we can all apologize to each other and move on.

516,NTA,AITA For not letting people stay at my house after they traveled over 10 hours to stay here?,"I have a very well paying job which requires me to mostly work from home with the occasional travel(Usually once a month for a few days) to certain locations as a result I could choose to live wherever I want and I chose a lovely big home next to a lake with a ton of nature surrounding it, I am not even kidding, sometimes I have to pinch myself when I just woke up because I feel so blessed I got to live here.

Now I am from a big city which is where most of my old friends and family still live and as a result on a monthly basis I get at least one person asking me if they can ""come to see me"" which is a different way of saying they need a vacation and want to stay with me. I'll be short, mostly my answer is a simple no especially if I need to travel during their stay as I don't trust anyone but my dad and girlfriend to be alone at my house. However on occasion I say yes, especially if I want to see someone.

So my college friend ""Brian"" contacted me asking if he and a buddy could vacation at my place for a week as they really need a break and he wanted to hang out like the old days. I agreed, I haven't seen Brian in ages but still actively talk to him, so why not? And before some of you start about covid, you can have people over here and there hasn't been an outbreak here or in the city they live in months.

So we agree when he will arrive and he'd bring another of his college buddies. Well the day comes, I prepare the guest rooms and an hour before they are supposed to arrive Brian messages me that something came up and he can't come, I figure okay then, but I get a message a few minutes later that he got another one of his buddies to take his place. I told him I was not comfortable letting 2 strangers stay and didn't get a reply.

At any rate roughly an hour and a half later my doorbell rings and 2 dudes stand there with their luggage. I say hi and ask them what they want and they say they are staying here, I say they ain't and tell them to bugger off, they ask me if they can at least stay the night, I say no. Brian calls me later going out of his mind with anger claiming I am a giant AH and that his friends had to drive for hours only to drive back home when he told me they would be coming. I told him to go F himself.

His friends probably at least I assume knew nothing about this so I feel terrible for them.",2020-11-19 18:31:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jx8a6i/aita_for_not_letting_people_stay_at_my_house/,486,7556,0.97,3

My older sister Angie and me are inseparable.When we were younger we'd play together all the time,tell eachother our secret's,if one of us got in trouble the other would take the blame,we would do eachother's homework's and she's partly the reason why I've got an A+ on my math exam.

She is married to a man named Liam,and together they have five children.Angie is working all the time and because Liam does not have a job he is left home to take care of their children.I mainly visit them to help Liam,and in one of those particular visit's of mine he had asked to speak to me in private.

That's when he had admit to me that he was gay,and that he has been going around in gay bar's.He told me how he was only staying with Angie because of the children and that otherwise he would've left her and wen't on to be with another man.I was shocked and speachless,but I've told him that I wouldn't tell anyone and he called me the best brother-in-law ever.

But in the end,question's of infedelity came since he did tell me he was going out in gay bar's and there was a possibilty he was sleeping with other men so I decided it was best if I told Angie about his homosexuality after all.

When I told Angie about it,she and Liam had a full blown fight.She kicked him out of their house and is currently filing for a divorce.I've tried messaging Liam but he keep's telling me how I violated his privacy and that I was a huge dickhead for telling Angie but Angie thanked me for it and told me that it was a good thing I didn't hide anything from her.

Angie and I still have the same relationship as we did before,but I still think that I might be the asshole in this situation.

We went to a fancy Italian restaurant together.
I am Italian. My family lives in Italy, and I lived there for more than twenty years before moving to the US.
While my boyfriend and his friends all ordered wine and ""fancy meals"", I opted for a soft drink and some roasted chicken with fries.
I've always been picky, and I'm not a fan of the american version of Italian food. I seldom eat italian here in the US, and that dinner was not an exception. 
One of my boyfriend's friend, J., made a joke about me being ""clearly not fancy enough to enjoy real Italian"".
I replied that I like my italian food in Italy.
I think J. understood something like ""I once went in Italy and liked the food there"", and proceeded talking about his two weeks in Europe 5 years ago.
I said nothing about it for the rest of the meal. While we were eating dessert, one of the other friends asked me where I was from, since she noted my accent was a bit weird. I replied Italy.
J. instantly went silent. He barely looked at me when we said our goodbyes.
Later my boyfriend told me I was kind of a dick, but he's a bastard and probably enjoyed the look on J.'s face. One of his friends later messaged him to let him know that I'm an AH for embarrassing J.

My dad suffered from sciatica that put him out of work for a while. so we all had to stay home to take care of him. During that period of time, I didn't do anything except work, and come home. So I figured, considering that I'm the only employed person in the house, maybe I deserve a little privacy when my dad didn't need to be attended to. Boy was I wrong. My mother and I got into a big argument over the fact that my bedroom door was closed. She asked me why I had closed the door. And I told her that I just wanted some privacy. My mother replied to this by saying ""You don't have any privacy in this house."" At this point I'm annoyed. And I said. ""Then this isn't a house, it's a prison."" My mother looked stunned at this. And then she asked, what made me say that. I told her that not having any privacy is the same thing correctional officers tell inmates in prison. And that if she didn't believe me, that she should ask Dad, since he used to be a correctional officer. She just looked at me and said...""Well if you don't like it, you can pack up your stuff and go.. And that's exactly what I did...It took a while (little less than a year.) but my dad's sciatica had healed up quite a bit. And he was able to walk around on his own to do a lot of things.

We might not have agreed on a lot of things but I didn't wanna see them homeless.For about a month or so, things were working out fine. My dads sciatica was healed enough to where he was able to get a job as a security guard. Then things went a little sour.

520,NTA,AITA for telling a friend that her artwork is not my style and that is why I don't buy her art?,"My friend is an artist and draws really realist, very classic/traditional looking animal portraits. It's her main source of income and she really pushes her business and particularly pet portraits as gifts, especially around the holidays. She uses a tan, textured paper she loves and draws with colored pencils. I once asked if she ever thought about using a different kind of paper for drawings for those that don't really care for the look of it and she said absolutely not, because she loves drawing on the paper she has. 

Between us I do not like the look of her art at all, but I have never and will never tell her this. I hate the paper she uses (it gives the drawings a weird textured look because of the way the paper is made) and I am not a fan of the light, faded colors she uses. It's not my style and as talented as she is I have never bought art from her because I don't care for it and it doesn't appeal to my own art tastes. 

My problem is that I recently purchased a commission from another artist friend. He art style is more modern, she uses copic markers and a clean, bright paper. Her style is bold, bright, and fun. I had her do a modern piece of my dog that is a gift for my fiancé. I posted it on social media when I got the finished piece and gave it to him and tagged the artist and thanked her for the beautiful artwork. 

My other artist friend saw and confronted me and asked why I didn't use her. I explained that I find her extremely talented, but her art style and her medium are not my taste or my own personal style.

She lost it. Called me names. Told me I am unsupportive. Said I would rather give strangers money than her (the artist I used was another friend but she did not know that.) She is now badmouthing me to mutual friends and passive aggressively posting about me on social media.

521,NTA,AITA for lying about my wife having fertility issues?,"My wife is trans and we met for the first time after she fully medically and surgically transitioned. Nobody besides her family (and my sister, who found out on her own) really knows this, and she wants to keep it that way.

Anyway, we both wanted to have kids young so we adopted our little girl before the pandemic started. Because of everything that's been going on, my parents didn't really get to meet her until last week, and my sister and her husband were also there.

My parents are very conservative, and they've been a bit disappointed about the fact that we adopted--nothing really explicit, but just subtle things. After they met our daughter, though, they melted a little (because how could you not?) but they still wanted to know why we adopted. I felt a bit clever saying ""fertility issues,"" because we *do* have fertility issues, just not the kind my parents probably thought.

My sister didn't say anything at the time, but she let loose on me later. I forgot that she has fertility issues, and she started yelling at me saying that she's been spending ten of thousands of dollars on in-vitro, how depressed it's made her, how her marriage is on the rocks, and how she's traumatized from her miscarriages (I didn't know she had any). She told me that she trusted me with that and that I'm immature. I told her that we technically *do* have fertility issues, and she said it's different because we ""chose"" to have ours and we knew what we were getting into. She said that it wasn't our issue to appropriate. All the women I dated before my wife were cis but I didn't fall in love with any of them. I don't think I ""chose"" to fall in love with her, so that made me pretty upset.

I wouldn't have felt like I was in the wrong until my sister told me that I could have just said that I felt like it would be better for the world to adopt. I still think it would have been met with a lot of suspicion and criticism from my parents, but that would have been the easiest way to avoid anybody getting hurt, and now I've built this unnecessary rift between my sister and I. My wife says that we *do* have fertility issues and she feels bad for my sister because of everything she's going through, but ultimately we have nothing to apologize for because we told the truth.

I don't know what to think about all this. AITA?",2020-11-17 17:01:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jvwnht/aita_for_lying_about_my_wife_having_fertility/,639,5363,0.94,13
522,NTA,"AITA for telling my MIL it's weird that she thinks she gets ""a say"" on things relating to my daughter?","My MIL is mostly a person who is easy to get along with, but for some reason, the lady has snapped after we announced that I'm pregnant. We let her get out all of her excitement, but didn't really encourage it. She keeps doing this weird thing where she refers to the baby as ""her"" baby. If I can be honest... I'm sure it'll change as time goes on, but I find the whole thing rather boring. Congrats, someone who I just so happened to be married to shot a load in me without a condom, and now I'm knocked up. It's really not that exciting or interesting, and I cannot relate to women who never shut up about it. It's like the only thing anyone wants to talk to me about.

ANYWAY. MIL was over a few weeks ago and started talking names. She told me to give her a list and she'd go through and let us know which ones she liked or didn't like.

I asked her why that was necessary, and she said ""Oh, you know! Just making sure we're on the same page.""

I asked for clarification to that, why we'd need to be on the same page, and she started getting a bit cagey about it. Oh you know. Just one of those things. Gotta make sure everyone's on board with the name.""

At that point, I cleared my throat and said, very kindly but firmly, ""There's no reason for anyone else to be 'on board' with the names we've chosen.""

She got a bit upset at that and said ""Well it's my grandchild! My *baby!*""

I said ""No, she's not *your* baby. Grandchild, yes. But... you don't think you get 'a say' in anything involving her, do you? Like... you don't think you get any say in her name, how she's raised, what schools she goes to, how she dresses, any of it, right? You know you're not the parent here, right?""

Well, she blew up. Calling me ungrateful (For what? Bitch you aren't doing anything!), snobby, snooty, the whole shebang. I just got up and said I was bored with this conversation and went to the backyard to go read in the sun while she melted down to my husband about how I'm stealing all the joy from her and that don't I get that grandma is the most important role she'll ever play?

My husband told her to knock off the theatrics and go home, and now she's going all over social media playing up what a victim she is because, I guess now we're ""keeping her baby away"" (Which... isn't true? The little fucker still hasn't been born yet?). I've had so much pushback from family telling us we need to just get over it and learn to accept that Grandma's going to be around and that yeah, maybe she should get a say in some things, after all, it's her grandchild.

I'm at a loss here. Maybe this is some weird cultural thing (We're in the Southwest US, everyone is some bland mix of white, no religious stuff other than the usual fake Catholic (C&E) stuff.

AITA?

**EDIT:** Well, this was certainly a post. I'm glad I'm generally not the asshole. The sexist claims that I'm trying to be ""edgy"" and ""not like the other girls"" are honestly depressing. I didn't expect people to get so upset because a woman would dare not think having a baby is the most OMG sacred beautiful lovely thing or whatever. I hope those of you who think it's a ""not like the other girls"" thing can maybe get out there and explore what different women are actually like, and not just the ones in your immediate lives. Women come in all shapes and sizes, attitudes and personalities. Being one way is not a condemnation of how other women are. Being bored by childbirth and all of that isn't a condemnation for those who think it's a big deal or a miracle. Swearing and being inappropriate being ""edgy"" or ""tryhard"" is such a very Reddit thing to say about a woman who doesn't behave the way you think she should. Some of you women need to really reach deep and explore the internalized misogyny.

Best of luck to everyone, and thanks for the kind words. ",2020-10-19 22:11:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jec4g9/aita_for_telling_my_mil_its_weird_that_she_thinks/,2566,17342,0.89,50
523,NTA,AITA for not giving up my vacation time to a coworker because her daughter has cancer?,"My coworker’s 7 year old daughter has been diagnosed with cancer and I feel awful for the whole family and am so sorry. 

The office got together to discuss ways we could support our coworker in a more meaningful way than just kicking a few dollars over or sending cards. 

Someone suggested that because she was having to take a lot of time out to be with her daughter in the hospital that we pool our vacation time for her so she could take that time as paid time off. 

That’s a real nice thing to do and I have great respect for anyone who does choose to go in on that, but I myself want that vacation time to visit my parents who I haven’t seen in months. 

My coworkers realized I was the only one who didn’t donate (they were tallying up the total time collected to make the announcement for her and realized the numbers didn’t add up) and confronted me on it, saying everyone had plans but they weren’t as important as this emergency situation was.

524,NTA,AITA for being mad at my friend for stealing my baby names?,"I’m (21F) 17 weeks pregnant. My friend (let’s call her H (21F) just gave birth to twins (1 boy 1 girl). 

when i first found out i was pregnant H and i went out for coffee to discuss all things babies and pregnancy and it was lovely to be able to talk to someone about it who knew what i was going through and who already was my friend. while out for coffee we discussed baby names, I brought up my two top favourites, Delilah for a girl and Theodore for a boy. She brought up her favourites which were Asher and Ashleigh. I politely said that i thought that was a bad idea in twins because having such obviously matching names may make their struggle with identity worse, even if they’re boy girl twins. She agreed and said she’d think of other names. 

Fast forward to last night, she calls me to tell me she’s had the twins and that they’re perfectly healthy, but she hasn’t settled on names yet. I’m super excited for her because she had a difficult pregnancy and at one point we weren’t sure if the boy was going to make it. I told her that she shouldn’t stress about naming them and that if she waits the perfect names will come to her. 

Today she posts her birth announcement on instagram and posts the babies names. She chose Delilah and Theodore. AITA for being mad at her about that, or am I overreacting

525,NTA,AITA for making my friend cry and giving her an “ultimatum”,"My previous post got removed bc of character limit.

My friend Kate is passive aggressive when she’s upset. She’s not upfront with me or my friend group and drops “hints” and then gets upset when we don’t get the memo. Even tho we always tell her to speak up in every argument 

For example: she never breaks up with a bf she just acts crappy when she’s tired of him and waits for him to break up and then calls him dumb for not taking the hint. She always says stuff like “it would be nice to have x” “x looks cool” instead of saying “i want x” and then gets mad when we don’t get her x. Those are a few examples.

My friends had a Friendsgiving on zoom last night. I couldn’t go bc I had a lot of hw and a quiz that night. Everyone seemed to understand Im the group chat.

Last other after the zoom party Kate texted me surprised that i didn’t make it. She told me that she thought I picked up her hints that she was upset that I couldn’t go and figured I would try to finish my work faster. I asked what hints. And she freakin said that the hints where her sending dry messages since she usually doesn’t do that.

I blew up and told her: did no one teach you to use your words? If you’re mad you say that you’re mad. Babies communicate better and all they do is cry. I’m not a fucking mind reader. You either tell me what’s wrong or move on. See what I’m doing rn? I’m feeling how I feel instead of dropping hints. You’re not the DaVinci code. Now if you’re still going to be passive aggressive and not upfront tell me right now so I could end this friendship bc I can’t take it anymore.

My friend group thinks I’m the AH. Because even tho I’m technically right(their words) I shouldnt have been so insulting and harsh. They also think my last sentence was an ultimatum which isn’t cool. And according to one friend Kate called them crying about me. Which made me feel like and AH too bc I’ve never already anyone cry.AITA? 

Edit: I apologized to her. I texted her this: Kate, what I said to you was not cool. I shouldn’t have let the stress get to me and i see that said some messed up things. I’m sorry for the way I spoke to you bc no one should be blown up at no matter how tired one is of any situation. Next time I’ll make sure to get my point across in a way that’s effective and helpful for all of us.

I wish I could’ve said it over the phone but she didn’t pick up after 3 calls. And although I texted her this i will also distance myself from her bc I don’t see her changing and don’t want to put myself in this situation again. Idk if I could just ditch her as a friend completely bc she’s in my friend group. 
 Thank you also for the rewards and verdicts some of you had really sound advice. Hopefully I can figure out how to diffuse any situation with her next time she gets pissed at me bc I also don’t want to have to fix every issue she has with me I just want peace",2020-11-26 15:43:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k1hdek/aita_for_making_my_friend_cry_and_giving_her_an/,321,5350,0.97,11
526,NTA,AITA for “not respecting” my co-worker’s peanut allergy?,"We have a new employee I will call “Heather.” I have candy dish on my desk which has various types of candy in it. Right now I happen to have the little Reese’s peanut butter cups. Heather noticed my candy dish and said, “You know, I’m allergic to peanuts.” I said I was not aware of her peanut allergy but I did have some other kinds of candy in my dish without peanuts if she wanted any. She said, “You don’t seem to get it. I could die.” I said yes, I have heard that can happen sometimes. I said that at the time I purchased the candy for my dish she was not employed by our company yet and next time I would be sure not to buy candy with peanuts. She then said, “Don’t you think it’s insensitive to keep that death-inducing candy sitting on your desk? You’re not respecting my peanut allergy.” I said I did not think it was insensitive because all she needed to do was not take any of it. She told me I needed to “get rid” of my candy and I told her “no.” I said, “We have employer-sponsored health insurance. If you know you will die if you come in contact with something as common as peanuts, I suggest you get an eppi-pen.” She went to Human Resources and basically told them I was putting peanut butter candy on my desk to harass and bully her because of her peanut allergy. I got a lecture from HR and was directed to never bring anything containing peanuts into the office again. I definitely think she is an asshole, but I am not entirely sure about myself.
EDIT: A lot of people are talking about airborne peanut allergens. I don’t think it’s that kind of peanut allergy because she was standing right next to my candy dish the entire time she was arguing with me. Also she didn’t correct me when I said that as long as she didn’t eat any of the peanut candy it wouldn’t be a problem for her. Also when I talked with HR they did not say anything about an airborne peanut allergy. I know I wasn’t nice and I am not saying I was not an asshole. I do want to say if I thought she was in any actual danger I would remove the candy right away.
ONE MORE EDIT: I don’t know if it makes a difference, but my candy dish primarily had non-peanut candy. Kit-Kat, Milk Duds, Whoppers, Rollos, and then Reese’s cups. It all came together in the same bag like a Halloween candy mix. Then I added milk chocolate Dove candies (no nuts). We are literally talking about no more than three Reese’s cups in the candy dish. Not an entire dish full of Reese’s.
UPDATE: Today I went to the HR lady to discuss me being the only person instructed not to bring peanuts to the office. The HR lady said, “I owe you an apology. We should have done our due diligence before we said that, and we shouldn’t have singled you out. At this time we have no reason to limit anyone from bringing peanuts to the office.” I asked her, “What about Heather’s allergies?” She kind of rolled her eyes and said, “I really can’t talk about her private health information. All I can say at this time is that I haven’t seen any evidence that supports the need to limit any employee’s exposure to peanuts. Going by the evidence we have, Heather will be just fine and that’s all I can say about it.”",2020-11-24 21:25:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k0e5mn/aita_for_not_respecting_my_coworkers_peanut/,587,2144,0.95,1

So im gonna skip the build up and say we were a wonderful family unit I thought my kids were the best siblings until 24m slept with 26m's wife and after the divorce they got together and had a kid. 
26m won't even acknowledge that he has a brother and we have all completely cut contact with him. 
Unfortunately this means that I can't see my grandkids but when I last spoke to my son I told him "" you sold your family for some disloyal pussy, I hope its worth it."" 
Now I haven't spoken to him in about 3 years and we have begun to build my son back up to the man he was before and we were having a small party for his birthday and somehow someone who didn't know the story asked about his brother and I said I don't know and they asked what he does and I said again I don't know and they started getting upset with me saying that its sad that a father doesn't know anything about his own son.  I told them that he made his decision and I'm not gonna disuse this any further. 

Honestly I have missed my son but I can't began to think of how much it would hurt 26 to have me disregard his feelings for those 2. 

So AITA

Edit: I apologize for my failure to communicate this effectively but the affair happened for about a year before my son found out and the divorce happened. 
This happened 3 years ago and they were those ages at the time of the blow up they are now 29m 27m and 23f. Exwife/wife is now 28 and was 25 at the time. 
They had been married for 4 years and my wife and sister loved her he was my wifes baby and the first one to get married and she would just adore any one that made one of her babies happy. When my wife died she took it as hard as any of us so I really thought of her as my daughter. 26 was alot like me he was brash and but hardworking but kinda unambitious. My wife loved that about him and they were always closer to each other then they were to me or the other kids, whereas I liked to hang out with the kids that behaved more like my wife my headstrong and highly ambitious son and daughter 24 and 20. They were my favorite children, they were the ones that I went to bat for when fun met funds. I know I shouldn't say this but they all know it i guess. Maybe thats what made 24 thnink that he could get away with anything with me. But I spent 26 years doing everything I could think to do to help my kids be good people. I hate that this situation ever happened but I do not support betrayal.


So I just got a phone call that I didn't expect. My oldest son just told me that he saw this post and wants to talk about what we should do going forward. We're going to talk after church and I'll see what he wants to do. I hope he's not mad at me for airing his business. I'm just so scared but I think this needs to happen. 

And thank you all for the comments and awards. I am truly sad and humbled but I have to say that maybe the reason that other parents don't do what I did is because it is so hard and I think easy is the normal way that people do thing.",2020-11-14 19:20:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ju7ikx/aita_for_not_forgiving_my_son_for_what_he_did/,691,6795,0.97,17
528,NTA,AITA: For telling my husband that I'll never invite his family again after he said I embarrassed him with my cooking?,"
Title sounds horrible but hear me out please.

So, my 35F husband's 37M family recently moved to our town to live close to us and my brother in law who got married a few months ago.

My inlaws like to gather twice a month for dinner and they'd have me and my husband visit (3h drive) once a month. My mother in law wouldn't accept any excuses that I work and have kids to take care of. She always wants the family gathered at her house.

Last week. While we were visiting their new house. My husband made me spend x money for a gift that he didn't help with. Also had me carry boxes to help them move stuff into their house while my brother in law's new wife sat on the couch and was served with coffee and sweets.

He told them that he wanted to invite them over for dinner the next day and he didn't even consult with me first so I had to take the day off so I could prepare meals. I made the main dishes, appetizers, salad and pound cake.

They arrived at 7pm. Mother in law, brother in law's wife didn't move a finger, they were busy criticizing my table setting and giving “advice”.

I put dinner on the table and my mother in law started asking why I used x ingredient instead of x ingredient. Saying that she would've liked it. Then said that the salad was not necessary because no one liked this type of salad. My husband just agreed with her telling me why i didn't do it this way or that way. I was getting mad and lost my appetite. Mother in law said the pound cake was not complete and didn't look delicious. My husband told her that he wanted to get one from the bakery but I didn't allow him. The cake stayed the same while they ate what brother in law's wife brought and flattered her.

After they left. I told my husband that his mom was being rude and mean to me the whole time. That he should've stopped her instead of agreeing with her. He said that he didn't defend me because I was in the wrong and what I cooked was not so great and that I embarrassed him infront of his family after having them try my cooking for the first time..

I got mad at him and told him I will no longer invite his family for dinners and he didn't like that since he told his mom that we will regularly invite them for dinner. He called me too sensitive and that I should just focus on cooking what they like instead.

He thinks I'm overreacting but I'm so angry and feel like I been insulted and disrespected in my own house.",2020-10-23 18:11:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jgshbu/aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_ill_never_invite/,1888,17994,0.96,33

She said yes and good luck with that. My husband removed it from her recycling bin before it got picked up and gave it me.

 Anyways I looked on YouTube and there was a video that I followed were I just boil it in dish wash liquid and water it would come out and it worked  it looked good as new. My husband took a picture and showed his sister and she was so excited and said thank you!!!! She was planning to try that dish again and wants him to bring it back. I refused to give it back because she was going to throw it away and said I can have it. SIL is now angry and saying I am an asshole and should just buy my own because we have two salaries and she's a single mother. She is 50 years old but throwing the biggest fit.

I didn't know it would clean so easily of course and I simply googled it when I got home. SIL is always on her phone Facebooking so she could of easily googled it too.

I still get him gifts, things I know he wants: new video games, camping gear he wants, etc. He will tell me the things he wants for Christmas or his birthday and I will always get them for him along with other things I think he’ll like. 

We were hanging out recently and I mentioned to him that if he was looking for a gift, there was something that I really wanted. I showed him what it was and he said “if you want it, just go ahead a buy it”. I told him I’d rather have it as a gift, and if he wanted to get me something different, I’d rather have the gift from him since it would be more special coming from him. He said that buying me gifts was pointless since I would see the money leaving the account and know that he had bought it (we have a shared bank account). I told him it wasn’t pointless to me and I’d like to get a gift on Christmas regardless, and he said if I wanted a gift I could just buy one for myself. He hasn’t gotten me gifts in a couple years and I feel like he doesn’t care how much this hurts me.

531,NTA,AITA for doing native beadwork as a white person?,"I’m a white girl living in the US (I’m a Russian Ashkenazi Jewish immigrant if that matters) and I’ve somewhat recently picked up beadwork of the plains style (appliqué work). I do not sell my work at all, and I usually make keychains and the like, incorporating some pop culture items, and follow the traditional two needle method (shoutout to YouTube for teaching me). I draft most of my designs, and the ones that I don’t I make sure to research to make sure I’m not somehow beading something with cultural significance, since it’s not my culture. 

However, I was recently talking to my friends about my beadwork, and they informed me that it was cultural appropriation. I avoid any kind of sacred motifs, nor do I make any claims to be native, and the only “profit” I get off of my work are bloody fingers and the satisfaction of making things. 

So, am I the asshole for this? I know there is a history of cultural appropriation in America concerning native Americans, and the absolute last thing I want to do is perpetuate any of that.

Editing to add: I don’t know any native Americans, or I would have asked them. I have no plans of selling my items, only making gifts and the sort.

I (25F) share a house with three people. Ricky, Kira, and Paige (all 20s). Ricky and I are recent grads, and Kira and Paige are in grad school. They are also a lesbian couple.

Anyway, when we moved in we just furnished the house in some bare bones IKEA stuff. Paige mentioned wanting to put up some art, and I agreed, thinking it would just be a landscape painting or something.

But no — Paige apparently makes very not safe for work art, and she put it up in our living room. Highlights include a picture of a person licking a nipple and a fat stripper. Very weird stuff to be honest. 

I told Paige that dirty art could only be displayed in her room, and that stuff in the common area had to be appropriate for all ages. I used to have my elementary school age nieces over a lot, and I’ll start doing it again once the pandemic is over. I don’t want them to see super crude stuff.

Well, Paige was going to agree, but Kira freaked out and made it into a homophobic thing. I’m bisexual myself, and I tried to tell her that. Now nobody in the house is talking, and Ricky is mad at me too for causing drama.

AITA?

Edit to clarify: I’m totally fine with gay themed art (or any other art) as long as it’s appropriate for kids. Kira maintains that the art isn’t sexual, but a stripper and a literal tongue licking a boob is pretty sexual to most people. She also says that our apartment is an adult space and I just shouldn’t bring my nieces unless they can deal with it. 

Also, sorry for the no-context remark about the stripper being fat. Some commenters read it as ripping on fat people or saying they can’t be sexy — my bad.",2020-11-21 09:29:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jy81wh/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_that_her/,434,5698,0.97,2
533,NTA,AITA For screwing my son over in favor of his wife?,"My adult son ""Bob"" is a lazy, arrogant, entitled, abusive, know it all. I tried to parent him but my wife always threatened to divorce me and take all the kids any time I ""abused"" him (lecturing, grounding, taking away privileges) I know I'm not innocent in this, but Bob has turned out insufferable.

8 years ago Bob( then 26) married ""Beth""(19). They had twins right away so I gave him a glorified ""job"" that he's still doing. I gave Beth got an entry level position with a couple years later and she quickly worked her way up. She's indispensable now.  Three years ago I asked her to go to school to learn the technical side of the business. She's doing amazing and will even finish early.

Bob didn't want Beth to go to school, but I pressured and bribed to get him to accept. I offered an extra allowance and told him that she could help him run the company after I pass.

I might be TA because I lied. I have zero intention of giving him the company. Bluntly, he's incompetent.  I've been grooming Beth in the background to succeed me. I'm secretly planning to retire in the next 5-6 years after Beth is established.

Bob gave up his dream job to stay and work here. which I know is bad. But he was expecting me to fund his ""career"", so am I still the bad guy?

Edit: To answer a couple of questions 

1. Bob wanted to be a music producer 
2. I haven't directly told Beth that I will support her if she leaves, but y'all have convinced me I should

534,NTA,AITA For refusing to let my mom see my 2 months old daughter after she disowned me?,"
I (M27) met my now wife (F35) who was a single parent with three kids. She was 8 years older than me and we met when I came home. We started dating I met her kids and they seemed so sweet and we got along pretty well and I felt relieved because I was worrying too much my step kids wouldn't like me but I'm grateful to have met them and their mother.

My mom went crazy when I told her. She started arguing a lot. Telling me that marrying a single mother who's older than me wasn't going to happen, she got the whole family to agree with her. And tried pressuring me into going out with someone from the church who's nearly the same age as me.
I got fed up with this and I left after I told her no and that I was going to get married to my now wife with or without their approval.

My mom casually sent me a text the next day that she and the entire family disowned me and that I will never be allowed to come home after that then everyone blocked me and refused to talk to me.


My wife and I got married two months after I left home. We've now been married for 2 years and we have a 2 months old baby girl. She's the only girl with three boys so she was a sweet new addition to our family.

Last week. I started receiving calls from a number that I didn't recognize til I found out it was my mom. She knew that my wife and I had a baby girl and wanted to see her saying that my daughter is her grandbaby that she has a biological connection to.

I spoke with my friend who admitted telling my family about our newborn and how the whole family was excited to meet her. My sister reached out to me after I refused to let my mom visit and told me that I was being cruel and unfair to her for not wanting her to see her grandbaby. She told me that I shouldn't forget that my daughter is family and that will never change no matter what.


I got mad. I just couldn't help but get mad and argue with her because everyone sided with my mom who disowned me and told me to not come home ever again. And now they think I'd allow my mom to see my daughter because she is family to her.

They tried to set up a meeting twice but I refused. They're calling me cruel and using my daughter to get back at my mom for ""personal"" issues we had before. Completely forgetting what she did to prevent me from being with my wife.",2020-10-27 16:18:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jj482r/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_mom_see_my_2_months/,1462,18157,0.96,35
535,NTA,AITA for telling husband we shouldn't let MIL live with us?,"My (44F) husband (45M) has always been the black sheep of the family. His parents, mother in particular have never approved of his life choices and always favored his younger brother over him, and no matter what my husband did, they have never approved. 

My husband went limited contact with his family about a year after we got married when my MIL demanded he get a paternity test done on our oldest daughter because she didn't believe that she was his child. They have never met our two youngest children, and my husband and I have no plans to have them meet unless our children choose to do so. My MIL and I do not have a good relationship and I have not spoken to her in fifteen years.

Fast forward to last year. My FIL passed away and my MIL is not handling it well. Six months ago she fell and is having a hard time living on her own. My BIL called us last week and demanded that my husband take her in because he is ""too busy"" to take care of her. BIL also informed us that MIL has no money aside from her small teaching pension and cannot afford to stay in her house anymore. We asked what happened to the money she received from FIL's life insurance and it was spent.

Husband told my BIL we would discuss it and get back to him. I told him that in on uncertain terms was she coming here. My husband agreed, but feels guilty because she is his mother and will be homeless if he doesn't take her in. So I asked him about how much his mother cared about him being homeless when she threw him out of the house and he was sleeping in his car for three weeks. He said he understood, and he doesn't want her here either, but he doesn't want her to be on the streets.

I suggested we look into adult living facilities/care homes for seniors that we could move her into, as well as state funding to see if she qualifies. My husband is hesitant because he wnts to help his mother, but he also knows that her living with us is just not feasible because of the way she treats him.

He called his brother and told him that he didn't think her coming here was a good idea and brought up the suggestion about the senior living home and he flipped out. He called my husband ungrateful and shamed him for abandoning MIL in her time of need. Now his entire family is calling and texting and calling us cruel. Husband is starting to waffle and keeps saying that we could buy a house with an in-law suite. I told my husband that we aren't terrible that we are our own family and she had multiple chances to be a part of our lives but decided to be petty and hateful instead.

536,NTA,AITA for backing up my sister against my brother who called CPS?,"My sister found out she was pregnant earlier this year. This led to her leaving her ex, who has all sorts of issues that I can't mention on this sub. He has been threatening to file for custody if she seeks child support so it's a whole mess.

My sister moved into my house. It's a one floor house with a loft. I was remodeling the loft but when the virus ramped up, I paused the remodel. The loft does not currently have a railing so we blocked off the stairs with a puppy gate and plan to finish it when it's safer health wise to have contractors around.

Her baby was three weeks old and my brother came to visit. He saw the loft without a railing and freaked out even though we showed him that the stairs were blocked. We explained multiple times that we don't go up there and there's no way that an infant can get up there either.

We thought that was the end of it, but he ended up calling CPS on her. They came to my house and did a whole check and interviewed both of us. In the end, the agent said it was fine and the case was dismissed, but it was extremely stressful and could end up being ammunition against her if her ex ever decides to take her to court. She won't speak to our brother and he's upset because he feels he was doing what was best for our nephew. He thinks I'm too close to the situation and says I'm not thinking rationally when I tell him that he was wrong and I support her not letting him see the baby. Our father also says we're overreacting and we had nothing to fear if we had nothing to hide. I feel put in the middle but I have to support my sister, but I wonder if I'm doing the right thing in hating my brother along with my sister.

537,NTA,AITA for making my daughter wear ugly clothing as a punishment?,"My wife and I have a 15 year old daughter, Lily. Like my wife, Lily loves fashion, and has a huge collection of designer clothes. We don't mean to spoil her, but she is generally well behaved and very academically talented (top of all her classes at school). 

Unfortunately, the teachers discovered that Lily and her friends had been bullying another girl, and that Lily was the ringleader. I won't go into detail but we were told that if not for Lily's exceptional academic record, she would have been expelled from school. 

We offered Lily two punishments. 1) No phone and no contact with her friends for however long we decide 2) No nice clothes for the same amount of time. She chose the second. My wife padlocked her wardrobe but took out a few plain tracksuits and t shirts that she rarely wears. 

Lily was understandably very upset. Like her mother, she likes to dress her best for a ten minute trip to the shop. She hates this punishment but still prefers it over the first one we offered. 

I got a call from my sister today, saying that Lily had phoned her up in ""floods of tears"" about not being allowed to wear the clothes she loves. Lily told her that she feels like she's in prison because she isn't allowed to wear what she wants. My sister said Lily had ""never sounded so upset"". She tried to say that clothing is an ""expression of her personality"" and that Lily feels vulnerable and insecure in the clothes we made her wear. 

We don't intend to stop the punishment but my sister's call gave me a lot to think about. Obviously, Lily needs to be punished for what she did, but I don't like the idea of making our daughter feel upset and vulnerable.

538,NTA,AITA for refusing to accommodate my husbands sister and her family by making a separate meals for them?,"My husbands sister's youngest child was diagnosed with cancer shortly after birth. She and her husband have spent two years fighting for him and his health. Then Covid hit and what was already a very bad financial and emotional situation became worse. In September they were forced to leave their home due to a mold issue that may or may not have been there a while but went unnoticed because of how difficult the last couple of years have been on them. Then her husbands office was closed down and all employees were forced to move to the one in our town, three hours from where they lived before or find another job, which they did not feel safe doing in the current climate with their family circumstances. My husband and I discussed it and agreed to let them move in until after Christmas when hopefully the mold issue could be fixed and they could start the process to sell up and find another house.

So I will start by saying they pay for some groceries and help toward bills but not a lot because of their financial situation.

I started having an issue two weeks after they moved in. It was agreed upon by all four of us that I would make dinner and we would each do our own things for lunch. But she and their older kids started complaining about dinner, wanting something else, and expecting me to make it for them. It got to the point where the other night where my husbands sister asked me to make a lasagna for them in front of all the kids (both our husbands were at work) and her kids started to demand it where I lost it and told her if she didn't want to eat what I prepared then the least she could do is make it herself because it's not easy cooking enough for 9 people and then having 3 people reject it outright and often rudely, and expecting me to cook something very specific for them. It's even worse because the kids have made a fuss about dinner a lot since they got here and she says nothing to them and she isn't too far behind in that but at least she normally expresses it in a less demanding nature and has never pressed it in front of the kids before.

I have struggled with some guilt because they have a lot going on and I maybe should have just sucked it up. I can't always co-ordinate in advance about what they want for dinner but also, we don't always have whats needed to make what they want anyway and I'm already getting more groceries and doing more than I was before. I'm trying to be understanding but I worry I was an asshole. Things have been tense since. The complaints have not stopped though.

AITA?

&#x200B;

An update kind of: So my husband and his sisters husband are mad at my SIL. She does not want to participate in cooking. She also doesn't think it's fair to expect them to know what they'll wants days or weeks in advance. Her husband has promised his kids will behave better in the future but SIL doesn't think they were ever rude. She said I was rude for not catering more to the, as guests in our home and people going through a rough time. So IDK what we're going to do.

539,NTA,AITA for not checking the house?,"I (30F) live on a ranch with multiple horses, a few barn cats, and my service dog. Because of an accident when I was a teen I am legally deaf and have very limited hearing normally but do alright with a hearing aid. Unless you’re shouting next to me, if I don’t have my hearing aid in, I can’t hear you. 

Because of Covid spikes in my country most major metro areas went into lockdown. My brothers (32M) wife (30F) was afraid to be in the city with their new baby (6 month F) and my brother asked me if they could stay with me in the countryside. I agreed as long as they cleaned up after themselves and respected my animals space. Me and my SIL get along okay but we’ve never been close, she doesn’t know much sign language so I have to rely on lip reading when we talk. I really only use my hearing aid when I go out, but I’ve gotten used to not wearing it at home, which is where the problem is.

My brother had to go into the city over the weekend for work leaving me, SIL, and the baby alone for the weekend. On Saturday I get up and while making breakfast I see that both my brothers car and SIL’s car are gone. I think nothing of it, and begin my morning routine. By noon my SIL’s car comes back and I’m training a colt. A bit later and the colt spooks bad and starts pulling away from me, I try to calm him but a hand griping my shoulder and spinning me around forces me to let him go. SIL was screaming at me, I was only getting every other word and struggling to read her lips because she was talking so fast.

Apparently the night before, at some point she had told me she was going into town to shop but didn’t want to take the baby, so she asked if I could watch her. To her I  answered and she took it as a yes, so this morning she went shopping and left the baby for three hours. I told her I never heard her request, and had I known would have absolutely watched the baby. She called me a negligent monster for not checking the house and just assuming she took her baby. I told her that was unreasonable and asked why she didn’t make sure I understood her before she left. She called me a plethora of insults, and stormed upstairs.

I feel awful, the baby had cried all morning and I had no idea. It makes me sad and sick thinking about it. I tried to reconcile with SIL but she won’t talk or look at me. My brother came back late Sunday and agreed with his wife, that I should have checked the house before going out to take care of the animals and that his daughter comes first. I told them their baby is their responsibility and my animals are mine, and that SIL should have really made sure I understood her request before leaving. We fought, and now things are tense.

I don’t feel like TA because I’m opening my home to them, I’m not a babysitter, and if SIL had a request I feel she should made it clear. But on the other hand my poor niece was left for three hours, and now even my parents are calling me negligent.

Anyways this has caused problems for us because we usually make Halloween goodies for the kids with cool things in it usually ranging from $5-$10. We’ve run into cases where we’ve had so many random kids in the neighborhood that by the time kids I actually know come over, the goodies are all gone. 

Last year my husband and I decided to just get a big of candy from Costco to give to the other kids and just save the Halloween goodies for kids we personally knew. Well afterwards my son came home from school and told me some kids from his school apparently stopped by our house(we don’t know them) and were mad they didn’t get the special bags.

I am a mom of an only child(Jake) who just turned 9 back in August. Jake is obsessed with anything to do with building and wants to be an architect when hes older. I fully support this dream and have spent a crap ton of money buying the graph paper, the table, rulers, and the biggest expense, legos. He likes to spend his time drawing out his plans for his lego builds before he moves over to the blocks to actually build things and I think hes fantastic at it.

For his birthday, I cleared out our spare room and hubby and I set it up as Jake's ""office"" complete with a huge lego table. This room is my sons pride and joy and he spends alot of time in there. Anytime any kids come over, they have to have his permission to go in and we enforce it. Heres where the problem starts.

My SIL recently left her husband and her and her 3 kids came to stay with us. This would be fine if she hadn't started throwing a fit about Jake's office. She wants more room in our house even tho they have the entire finished basement that has a family room that they are using as a bedroom. She wants us to clear out Jake's office so she can have space away from her kids. When we told her no, she got angry. She then started demanding we let her kids play in there because Legos are toys and Jake needs to share. I told her she was out of her damned mind because Jake said he didnt want his cousins in there, that hes working on a huge project(he has been building a city). 

SIL went crazy and ended up destroying all the work Jake put into his build. ""Now theres no excuse"" I was beyond angry and went downstairs, grabbed her stuff, threw it into bags and threw it all out of my house, and told her to leave.

Our dad changed his Will a couple of years before he passed away, removing our mom from it. Our parents were separated and in the middle of divorce proceedings when he died.

My mom had an affair, which resulted in the breakdown of their marriage about 10 years ago. Subsequently it caused a lot of heart break, arguments and hostility not just between themselves but also for me and my sister towards our mom. This has somewhat resolved as the years passed, my sister was amicable with mom, for me... Our relationship was pretty much back to normal (I struggle with hating on others and find it easier to resolve the issue and carry on).

My dad confided in me some of the details of the divorce, most of which I would have rather not known, but he had no one else to speak with regarding it I suppose. Basically it did not paint my mom in the best light and honestly the actions and behaviours I observed her displaying following their separation tallied up to this. Unreasonable demands made with regards to finances and basically wanting to take most of my dad's pension.

Following his death when his Will was read to us we then discovered my mom had been written out of his Will. Our mom is wanting to take legal proceedings against us if we decide not to give her over half of the money he has left to us (she wants us to discuss via mediation). Our extended family who know some details about this issue appear divided as to what we do. Both myself and my sister believe she should not receive any of this money, however I feel guilty.

There's 3 rooms and I share a room with A (21M) because we have similar schedules and have been friends for years. My other female housemate (B) was dating C, and they obviously shared a room, with the other 3 guys in the biggest room.

Well, B and C recently broke up. She came to me and asked if I'd be willing to move into her room and C would move into mine, because it was awkward to cohabitate while dealing with the feelings from the breakup. I was like, yeah damn girl that's really rough, I feel like we wouldn't necessarily mesh as roommates though, could you ask one of the guys? For example, she wakes up early and I'm a night owl; she likes things super tidy and I'm more 'organized chaos'; she likes cutesy scented sprays that I'm not the best fan of. To which she said what no, she didn't want to room with a guy bc they're unsanitary/less neat. I said that sounded like a her problem (in nicer terms) and now she's basically giving me the cold shoulder.

AITA? I could switch and do her a solid (I definitely wouldn't want to be stuck in close quarters with a recent ex), but I like my room and I'm just casual friends with her and close with A, and I feel like it's a bit unfair that I'm the one expected to give up my living arrangement since I'm the only other girl.

545,NTA,AITA for telling my landlord that if she wanted me to babysit her kids it would be 100 dollars an hour?,"My landlord has 2 kids and she asked me in the past to babysit. The way the house is arranged is that it's a duplex house, she lives on the left side with her husband and two kids, I rent out the right side. Its basically it's own house, there are two enterences to the building and both halves are closed off.

I babysat once before as a favor when her husband had been in a car accident and she needed to go to the hospital immediately. I did it for free as a favor because it was an emergency.

But after that, she's asked me a lot to babysit, needing a break, saying how good I was with the girls, how it'd be nice for the girls to have an good female role model closer to their age then her (she is an older parent, I am 26 and the girls are 8 and 11.)

I said no at first and she kept pushing to say that she'd pay me, it would be no trouble at all because I'm right next door and if anything came up I could come and knock... 

I said no again.

Then a little while later her husband came to me and said that they really need a break and they'd pay me well to babysit just sometimes, what did I want? I said 100 dollars an hour. My side gig that I usually do after work is a freelance software engineering consultant and I charge 85, but for babysitting I would want additional hazard pay due to the potential covid exposure of having people out of my household in my home... A risk I don't have doing software.

He said I was out of my mind and I said that he wanted me to name a price and that's literally how I price my time. 

He got mad and was like ""a few evenings of that is equal to your rent,"" and I was like ""we can deduct it from my rent if that would make bookkeeping easier""

I called my parents later and my mom thought it was really rude of me to accept with a ridiculous number instead of decline... Like she thought if I didn't want to do it, I should have just said no instead of being a smartass about it.

546,NTA,AITA for calling the police on someone who parked in my driveway?,"Last Saturday our  neighbors had a yard sale. There was a decent amount of people that stopped by and they were fine parking in my neighbors driveway. We live on a very busy street, so parking on the road is a nuisance as there is no shoulder and people tend to drive well over the 35MPH speed limit that is posted.

To be clear, it is very obvious that this is our driveway on our property. We do not share an easement with the neighbors, so this person purposely pulled into our driveway because the neighbor's was full from other people at their yard sale. The way he was parked completely blocked both of our cars in so if we needed to get out, we couldn't.

About an hour into the sale, we noticed a car pull into our driveway. I asked my husband if he was expecting anyone and he said that he wasn't so he went outside to see what they wanted. He saw the driver, a passenger and two children get out of the car and walk over to the neighbor's yard sale. My husband called out to the driver of the car and told him he can't park there and to move his car. He told my husband that he had nowhere to park and the kids were with him and it was too dangerous to park on the street. My husband said he understood, but he needed to move the car out of our driveway.

The man proceeded to argue with my  husband until he finally told him to either move his car or we will call and have it towed. My husband came inside and asked me to call the non-emergency police line to see if someone could come out and ask the driver to move the car out of our driveway. An officer arrived within 10 minutes and my husband explained the situation to him. The other driver began ranting at the officer about not having a safe place to park, and the officer told him that it didn't' matter, that he was on our property and he could either move the car or the officer would call to have him towed.

The man started screaming curses at my husband and told him that if one of his kids got injured because he had to park in the road he was going to sue us. My neighbors (the ones having the yard sale) came over and told us that we were assholes for making such a commotion over them being parked in our driveway. My husband explained that they were the ones having the yard sale, not us, and that he would have never allowed strangers to park in their driveway because it's just rude.

Now my neighbors are badmouthing us to all of our other neighbors. Some agree that we were in the right, but the ones to the immediate right of us are now being cold to us and telling us that we are insensitive and have no sense of community.

So AITA or should I have let it go and let the man park in my driveway?

ETA: People keep asking why we called the police, we called them because the driver was becoming increasingly hostile and swearing. He threatened to sue us. We would most likely have let him stay if he had just asked us first. The second he started cursing at my husband, he had to leave, we do not know him, did not know what he would do or was capable of nor did we invite him. He was there for a neighbors yard sale that had nothing to do with our property.",2020-10-26 15:02:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jig4c4/aita_for_calling_the_police_on_someone_who_parked/,1697,14232,0.95,24
547,NTA,AITA for telling my dad I’ll stop living with him if he keeps making me uncomfortable at his house?,"I’m 16m and when I was 7 my mom passed away. My dad wasn’t doing good with money so he split custody with my aunt since she was also my godmother. I spent most days with my aunt and then a couple days with my dad because his work had him on the road a lot. 

2 yrs ago my dad came out and it was weird af ngl but I got over it after months. He hasn’t dated anyone that I know of. Like only one guy but it was less than 6 mos. Last year he got a better job that keeps him here so he had me come move in with him. 

First thing I noticed was that he has guys over like ALL the time. And I mean multiple guys, 4-5 sometimes a week depending how busy he is. Literally like different  guys every single time and it’s always really awkward. They don’t know me I don’t know them an now they r here in the house. My dad told me he’s just meeting different guys for fun and not to worry because it’s not anything serious but now I rlly don’t like it. 

Sometimes my dad leaves early for work and these guys are just left at the house or they roam around while he’s still sleeping in his room. There’s been times where I’m going to eat breakfast and there’s a rando in the kitchen w nothing but boxers on

Idk it makes me uncomfortable cause he doesn’t know who these guys are and they all know where he lives. Plus he leaves them alone in the house until they leave on their own. I’ve talked to my dad before and he says nothing bad’s gonna happen because he’ll protect and he’s just having fun. 

But how he gonna protect me when he’s the one leaving the house with me alone and then still there?? This something we’ve talked about a few times but he still doesn’t treat it like a big deal until I told him the other day if he’s gonna keep having random people over all the time then I’m just gonna move back in with my aunt. 

That made my dad sad and angry. He said he thought since it’s been years now that I’m okay with his sexuality and him finally getting to be this side of himself. I told him it had nothing to do with that I’d be saying the same if it was random ladies too because again they all know where he lives and he leaves them alone. 

Now he’s just not talking to me being all hurt. I haven’t told my aunt any of this yet. He still has guys over so I don’t wanna be here anymore feeling like I gotta tiptoe around the house every night. But I feel bad that this hurt him and idk if it was right to threaten leaving making him think I don’t support him.

548,NTA,AITA for not giving my parents their son back?,"When I(26m) was 20 years old my mum and dad had a 1 year old son eddie, they were struggling in their marriage and had been for years. They thought having another baby would magically fix things but they were wrong as it just caused more problems and strained their finances. They were in over their heads and decided go give eddie up for adoption I begged them not to but they had made up their minds, social workers asked other family members if anyone would like to take eddie, both my older brothers refused and my grandparents were too old so I took my brother in. This royally annoyed my parents and I was threatened with disownedment but I didn't care as I already had a place of my own with an ex at that time

My folks lost their paternal rights and I legally adopted my brother and I love him so much and was proud to be his daddy. My brothers didn't approve of me adopting him but I didn't care as they had never met him even when he was still with my parents. My grandparents helped me out a lot and were great. Unfortunately they have both passed since then and left me what money they had left to raise my bro. My folks and siblings were pissed but my aunt and uncles didn't care and thought it was best. At family events over the years my folks would be uncomfortable when I'd show up with Eddie but within the last year they had seemed to warm up a tad and I figured they themselves wanted to act more like grandparents as he is legally my son.

During the last few months however I've noticed my parents and brothers try and talk to Eddie on their own about if he knows who his mummy and daddy is. He says I'm daddy and usually I walk in and scold them before the conversation can go much further than that. I've yet to tell him the truth and I know I have to one day but I don't think now is the right time and even if it was I should be the one to tell him.

The other day I caught my mum trying to talk to Eddie about this again when she was visiting me, ed and my current partner. I asked my bf to take Eddie out for a bit where me and my mum got into an argument, she thinks I'm being a terrible parent and that its time she and my dad take Eddie back. I told her that there is no way I'm letting that happen so I kicked her out. Now my parents are threatening to sue for custody and my brothers agree while aunts and uncles say they support me no matter what

So AITA?

Edit: woah i expected a few replies at least not this many, I have decided that I'm going to tell him tomorrow. Have a me and him day and explain it the best I can and answer what I can

Edit 2: okay so I told him, its half term here in the UK so he didn't have school. Around lunchtime I took him to get his favourite food, we then went for a walk in the park talking about family and stuff. Eventually we sat down and I told him about how I adopted him but I'm still daddy and that I still loved him but then I explained how I came to look after him. Its fair to say he didn't understand some things and has been a bit quieter than usual but he cuddled up to me while I was watching a film I loved when I was a kid and said ""I love you daddy"" when I put him to bed. I'm feeling better and I hope he does too, to say its been an emotional day is an understatement.",2020-10-28 10:12:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jjl38m/aita_for_not_giving_my_parents_their_son_back/,1308,18635,0.97,92
549,NTA,AITA for not supporting my cousins relationship?,"My younger cousin(23f) and I(27f) have been super close since she turned 16. We did most things together and she even lived with me for a bit when she turned 18. It's been great and I even see her as more of a little sister than a cousin. 

From ages 13-25, I dated and was engaged to Mark(27m). My cousin knew him well. When I turned 25, Mark and I had a serious discussion about marriage and children and ended up breaking up. He had lied to me our entire adult relationship about wanting marriage and kids. It killed me. My cousin was there for me the entire time. You can probably see where this is going.

A month ago, my cousin announced she was pregnant and engaged! I was excited for her until I went over for a celebratory family cookout and met her newly moved in fiance. Guess who it was? Yep, it was Mark. My world came crashing down and I just left. I didnt say anything, i just walked out. Family tried calling, my cousin tried calling and texting me but I didnt answer anyone.

 After about a week, I finally answered my cousins call. She told me she needed me to be there for her and she knew it was weird, but he was going to be family and I should be happy for her. I told her I couldnt support any of this and to please not contact me again.

I now have family telling me what's done is done and i need to get over it because cousin is getting married and having a baby, that i need to think of her and that this is an exciting time for the family.
I told everyone to fuck off and if they support this, not to contact me again because family wouldnt do this to eachother. They called me a bitch and told me it's been 2 years, that no one owns a man, and I needed to shape up because this is happening. I blocked all of them.

550,NTA,AITA for asking my boyfriend to help me repay for some of my makeup he accidentally broke?,"Okay so, I already probably sound like an AH, and I feel as though I am too, because it was an accident, I just think I need somebody to bring it home for me.

Whenever my boyfriend trims his beard, he likes to clear off a section on the sink, on that section, usually sits my makeup bag, toothbrush pot, and some skincare bits. He usually puts all this stuff on the literal *edge* of the other side of the sink. I always tell him to please not to do that with my makeup bag at least, because it's full of expensive Clinique make-up products that cost at least £200. I'm 19, I can't afford to replace all that easily, I worked my butt off to save enough to get myself those makeup products as is.

Anyway, you probably know what's coming, once again, he was trimming his beard, and after the million times I told him not to put my makeup on the edge of the counter, he did it again, and surprise surprise, it fell and the majority smashed, the powders, highlighter, and eyeshadows all broke into little pieces, the foundation bottle broke in half, the only salvageable things in there was a mascara, an eyeliner and two lipsticks.

I was devastated, he told me I shouldn't be so emotionally invested in these monetary objects and said if I didn't want it to fall I should have moved it somewhere else in the first place.

I asked him if he could help me replace at least the foundation and eyeshadows, but he said it wasn't his fault because it was an accident.

AITA for asking in the first place?

Edit: just to clarify where my makeup bag sat, it was in a very safe position on my side of the counter, I told him when he trims his beard he can move the makeup anywhere else on the sink, just not the edge, our sink is one of those double counter ones and there's plenty of space to put things on.

Edit 2: to add on from the first edit as I was asked to add this bit- we have one sink which has counter space on both ends. One side is his and he doesn't like moving everything and getting beard hairs on his stuff so he uses my side when shaving, which is much more minimalist, so he only has to move the makeup bag which always goes on the edge for whatever godforsaken reason.

**Final edit: well, I brought it up again after all your comments, he's not budging on helping with the cost. And the biggest thing of all, a lot of you were right, it wasn't an accident, it was deliberate, so I'll leave it at that. Thanks to you all, I've come to realize that this may not be the healthiest relationship for me to be in, I've spoken to my mum so she knows what's going on and I'll probably be gathering my things to move out soon. I definitely wasn't expecting for things to take such a turn today, but I am thankful for all your comments and the people who private messaged me with helpful resources.

551,NTA,AITA for kicking out my parents because their beliefs made me uncomfortable?,"Here’s the situation...I (27M) have my mom and stepfather living with me. They used to live with my uncle in the neighboring town, but they recently got renovicted (I know, asshole move during a pandemic) and needed an emergency place to stay. I agreed to let them take my spare bedroom until January.

Well, my SD is a very Christian guy with unconventional beliefs. When they moved in he did a prayer walk around my house to cast out any evil spirit, he makes me join in praying a circle of “protection” around my place every night, and he has other religious things that aren’t my vibe really. At first I went along because he makes my mom happy and is a nice dude otherwise. But the other night he got mad at me for skipping the prayer time to have a beer on the porch. 

He got to complaining about my non religious lifestyle, drinking alcohol, and not watching the church livestream on Sundays. I told him it was my house, and as a guest he needed to adapt himself to my lifestyle. 

He started to get really upset, said he cared about me and he wanted our family to be strong in the lord. He shared how god helped him through a bad time when his first wife died. I told him that was great, but we have really different ideas about religions, and he’s gotta tone it down while he’s at my place.

My mom jumped in then to scold me, and I ended up telling her that they could stop complaining about my lifestyle or just leave. She and my stepfather went to stay at my cousin’s, and I don’t know where we stand now.

552,NTA,AITA for going over my boss’s head?,"I work for a fair sized company in England. They have offices in a few cities around the world but now they’re looking to open one in Singapore and want people for the role. 

I lived in Singapore from when I was 12-15 and my parents still live there so I approached my line manager about it. He said no bc I was too junior (I’m 22 and i started here 18 months ago fresh out of uni). I was disappointed. 

Couple days later I’m in the lift with the CFO so I decide to shoot my shot again. He was more receptive and turns out no one else in the company actually had experience working/living in Asia so they’d have been looking at an outside hire. Long story short I present my case and the CFO liked it because now I’m the number 2 guy in Singapore and people will be reporting to me (which is still surreal to me). 

However despite all this my boss was pissed because I ‘undermined him’ by going to his boss’s boss. Said it was a violation of corporate ethics etc. Even a couple of people on my level have said it’s bang out of order to go up the scale like this? I don’t really get why and I said “at the end of the day I got what I wanted so it must’ve been alright”.

553,NTA,AITA for not inviting my SIL to my baby shower?,"My husband (28M) and I(26F) had been trying for a little over 2 years to pregnant and now we are. My SIL Ava(32F) has been trying to get pregnant for 10 years though, so I was very thoughtful about how we would break the news to her. We told her in private and before we announced publicly. She took it well (or so I thought) My husband asked her if she’d be willing to be the Godmother and she said no. Understandable

Like I said , we’d also been ttc for two years so I had followed some fertility pages on IG. When I found out I was pregnant, I started to unfollow the pages, but I found Ava in the comments on one of them and these were some of the comments she’d posted. 

“honestly atp I fucking hate baby showers. I spend the entire time loathing whoever’s pregnant and being enraged it’s not me. I wish people would just stop inviting me.” 

On another post: “Ugh. Relatable. My SIL, sister and cousin are all pregnant right now. My SIL just announced she’s pregnant and the thoughts that went through my mind... & then they had the nerve to ask if I wanted to be the Godmother. HELL NO. I don’t even want to meet the thing at this point.”  + some other nasty comments. 

Then I found out she’d been talking about me to a mutual friend saying things like: “2 years isn’t even a long time for ttc” & “she doesn’t even deserve a baby, I’ve been waiting longer.” She also told my MIL she wasn’t coming to any more family dinners for the rest of the year because she couldn’t stand to look at me. 

I approached Ava about the comments, it turned it an argument & I told her that I thought her behavior was disgusting & she was not going to be around my child. She said some more vile things. I cut off contact.

Fast forward to this month, baby shower invites have been sent out (my country is semi-back to normal and we can now meet in groups again) & she’s angry she wasn’t invited. She thinks I would still want her around after all that, & telling my other SIL (who is also currently pregnant), that she hopes she loses her baby so she can experience the pain she’s felt. 

My husband says he wants to forgive her, and I told him he can if he wants but she won’t be at the shower. Ava’s husband has reached out to us and said verbatim: “You better not even THINK about apologizing. This is getting out of hand & I refuse to wallow in her bitterness so send me an invite because I’m coming with my gift.” We sent his. 

I feel sympathetic but I have to cut her off. I’ve been nothing but nice to her. She’s been taking hormones to get pregnant and a mutual friend swears that I should let everything go because of that but honestly, taking a medicine could very well be the reason she’s being a bitch but that doesn’t mean I have to accept being on the receiving end of it all.

554,NTA,AITA for proving to my family my mother is misogynistic?,"I forget where I read it, but someone said we most likely learned internalized misogyny for our mothers instead of our fathers. I’m a (18M) and been dealing with my hyper religious parents. 

My mother has always preached that a man and woman have there set roles in the house. Basically the man works and the woman does housework. So growing up I never liked this mindset. My mother would literally shove me out the house to work with my dad and have my sisters help her cook and clean.

But to the main story. My mothers been really sick lately (not corona) and she’s been unable to cook or do anything. My dad has been used to just having her cook so we’ve been surviving on a diet of takeout. If I have to eat another Wendy’s 4 for 4 I’ll lose it.

So I decided to use some money I had set aside to go to the store and cook a homemade meal. I watched a lot of people cooking it. It wasn’t the first time I’ve cooked, but it was the first time I’ve cooked for my parents. My dad will eat anything so I didn’t expect a record on how good it was from him.

But I gave some to my mom and she made comments like I’m a boy and can’t do the job right or whatever, and even after she ate it (multiple servings) she still told the family on our weekly FaceTime calls how bad it was and I should stick to working outside.

I knew she was going too, but i felt shitty having her laugh at my genuine effort. So I stopped doing everything I would do in the house. All the “womanly” tasks such as cleaning, washing the dishes and such. 

Since she was stuck in her bed she didn’t see how the house got. When she finally got better to walk around she saw how dirty it was. She began to yell at me for not cleaning and I reminded her that those were by her stands a woman’s job. 

She flipped and began to rage on our weekly FaceTime calls. So when my family asked me why I didn’t help I explained to her that she said those were woman’s jobs and I should be outside working, which I was. (I built a folding table out of only wood 😁) 

Now my family is laughing at her and she’s pissed. Some of my sisters said they know what she said, but she was sick as bedridden so I should of been the bigger man and done it anyway. 

But I think I was just listening to what she said. So AITA?",2020-11-14 17:39:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ju5s12/aita_for_proving_to_my_family_my_mother_is/,499,9966,0.97,17
555,NTA,AITA for not selling my decorative dress to my cousin?,"Some time ago, I saw a beautiful Victorian style dress on a shop, and I knew it had to be mine, even though it was pretty expensive. Weird thing is that I am a guy. A gay guy is true, but apart from that I am not interested in wearing typical women’s clothing or something similar. I just loved how it looked, the way it folded, the pattern, the material, everything. I ended up buying it and later found a female steel wire to create a ""homemade"" display of it in my living room. It has been there for almost 3 years (in perfect condition, I may add) and you could say is my favorite furniture piece if that makes sense. 

So, what is the problem now. My cousin is marrying next summer if certain global catastrophe allows it. After looking in a lot of boutiques (and I mean, a A LOT) she has concluded that the only dress she wants for such an event is MY dress. We are not even close to the wedding, but she has been insistent in that I should sell it to her for her big day. She has told me that she would even pay me more than the original price, so money is not the dealbreaker. 

The fact is, that as I said before, I love that dress. For me is like if she was asking me to sell her my favorite couch or something like that. I don’t want to part ways with it just so she can use it for a day and then hide it forever in some closet. I told her she could just have a designer create a copy of it, but she is adamant on having the original because she wants to preserve it's ""uniqueness"" and borrowing it has never been an option. 

The conflict is basically between her, my aunt, my uncle and her whole bridal party against me , arguing that it is dumb that I am attached to a piece of fabric I have never or will ever wear myself or let anyone else use. The rest of the family, including my parents, are taking a neutral stance on the matter.

556,NTA,AITA for not taking in my ex partners kids,"Okay so my title should read: AITA for not taking in my ex partner's parents kids.

I wrote this on my lunch break and it was the only thing I didn't double check before posting, feel free to chew me out for that mistake.

Just be honest with me here as if I'm the arsehole I will fully understand. All names of course are fake and I'm really bad at titles and summaries so bare with me.

I (29/m) lost my ex partner Olive of 8 years to cancer (she was 26) 3 years ago. She left me behind with our daughter Eve who is now 6. I won't lie, it's been a tough ride trying to cope with a small child without a lot of help from Olive's side of the family. Olive's parents Pat (47/f) and Rich (48/m) will only contact me over Eve, to cry about Olive being gone or it involves me looking after their other 3 kids A 13/m, B 10/m and C 9/m.

This brings me sorta onto my problem here where I could be the arsehole. Eve of course misses her mom a lot and has sorta created rituals to remember her. Eve often ask for candles to be lit so her mom knows she remembers her, she will buy her mom flowers for the house and will get highly upset if we need to move items her mom really cared about, This infuriates Pat as she acts like she's the only one able to mourn or remember Olive. She has demanded items Olive loved to be returned to her and has snapped at Eve that she couldn't even remember what her mommy smelled like so she clearly wasn't missing Olive as much as her. In short, it's been a long 3 years.

For the past 3 months Pat has gotten into screaming matches with me because she claims she can't cope with the loss of Olive and I need to step up to help her with the boys. I have pointed out Rich could take the kids but he's needed to apparently take care of her and her needs. Her idea is for me to take in the 3 boys help them cope with their 'mourning' so she can fully 'mourn' the loss of Olive and basically be a parent to 4 kids at once.

I really, really don't want to do this as the three boys in my opinion are uncontrollable. They will do anything for a reaction. Each time you try to either find out why they do it or punish them they will run to Pat who excuses their behavior as they are mourning their sister. My final reason for not taking them in at all is the fact B and C have told Eve that she's the reason her mom got cancer and passed away before denying they said it with smirks on their faces.

I've refused to take them as honestly it's gonna add more stress onto me, Eve will be a target for them and Pat refuses to give me a rough time limit of when she'd actually take them back. Of course that isn't the answer Pat wanted and she has been blowing up my phone calling me an arsehole for not caring about Olive's family but to me I think I'm right not wanting to deal with the boys around my daughter.

So reddit, AITA?

EDIT - In short, the three boys are Eve's uncles and Olive's siblings.

Pat and Rich are Eve's grandparents and Olive and the boys parents.

I'm Eve's dad who dated Olive and wasn't sure how to class my relationship with Pat and Rich as such as Ex-MIL or past MIL.

I have learnt I'm bad at Reddit and explaining my family situation.

EDIT 2 - This blew up more than I expected, as I expected maybe a couple of replies not at the time of this edit at 408 comment. I will update when things happen but I do plan to cut contact for least the time being. I do no have any plans to look after the three boys either.",2020-11-24 12:34:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k046ln/aita_for_not_taking_in_my_ex_partners_kids/,440,2991,0.96,12
557,NTA,AITA for trying to get a teacher fired for covering certain topics in my kids classroom?,"I recently moved from Western Europe to the US with my spouse who's originally from the US. Our kid enrolled in a local school which is open despite you-know-what.

Apparently his ""science"" teacher will dedicate the next month of his class to the ""intelligent design"" theory. I could not believe my ears when I heard this. Wtf is intelligent design and how on Earth did this make its way into the school curriculum? How can the government allow a **science** teacher present this alongside Darwinism as a valid school of thought? I saw red, I'll be honest.

&#x200B;

Long story short I confronted the teacher. Won't lie, I laid it in thick and was pretty disparaging in my commentary. I remained civil and criticized only the theory itself though. I demanded this is taken out of the curriculum. Teacher disagreed strongly and I escalated to the principal who backed him up. I'm now looking for legal ways to escalate further and at this stage I want the teacher removed from his position as I think he's unqualified to teach science to anybody let alone impressionable teenagers.

&#x200B;

AITA? Some folks tell me ""when in Rome (or Southern US in this case).."" and all that.

&#x200B;

I frankly have my mind blown anyone would think this is acceptable. In my home country it would have made front page and the school administration would be on the street looking for new jobs for being dumb beyond what's legal under our Constitution. Reddit, give me a new perspective - am I being culturally insensitive?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I should clarify, the teacher has a certain level of control over the curriculum. It's clear teaching intelligent design is not mandated by the state.

EDIT 2: I guess I need to say this out loud. Intelligent design is not a scientific theory. It’s a made up fairy tale. Teaching it to kids is not “allowing them to exercise their critical thinking.”  It’s elevating a bogus and nonsensical claim to the same status as scientifically sound research. It’s like claiming that it’s ok to teach astrology as part of an astronomy class “because it’s local culture and you can’t scientifically prove it’s incorrect.” Except you can and many have.",2020-10-29 00:53:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jk0dtg/aita_for_trying_to_get_a_teacher_fired_for/,1657,9047,0.92,34
558,NTA,AITA for leaving work on time when everyone are else still working?,"This bothers me every year and every time when this happens, it makes me wonder a little if I(Female, early 30s, single) am the AH. 

&#x200B;

You see, festival season is here - Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year, Lunar New year etc and as a gifting company we are busier than usual during this period. 

&#x200B;

The routine would be for our department to stay back after work to help the packing department to pack gifts, because we have mountains of gifts to pack, all labeled differently with different level of care and things can get very confusing and unorganized. This isn't compulsory nor paid, we ""voluntarily"" show up, that's how it is.

&#x200B;

I would usually do maybe 1-2 times and then leave on time, not willing to spend more doing free work. My colleagues from my own department and the packing department would also give me dirty looks whenever I do that, because it means 1 less helper and that they would go home later, and I am the only one who constantly do that. I don't usually care much because I stand firm on the point that I work for how much I am paid for, even if they hate me for it it isn't my fault.

&#x200B;

Yesterday it happened again, only this time one of my department lady asked me to stay because she couldn't, she needed to bring her children somewhere. I told her that since it's voluntary work, she could leave as soon as we are off duty. She then told me that if she did, everyone else would have to stay back later and that would be her fault. I told her again she was free to leave, just like me, and I left anyway.

&#x200B;

I came to work today with the same dirty looks from my colleagues, and one of them came up to me and told me that because of my selfishness, everyone, including the lady who wanted to leave, had to stay back until 8pm. The lady broke her promise to bring her children to see the glass Christmas tree display somewhere as it was very late. If I had stayed they could probably have finished it much earlier, and I wouldn't do it because I wanted to go home and enjoy my evening alone with my dogs.

&#x200B;

I did tell the lady that she was free to go if she really wanted to, nobody was forcing her to stay. If she had anyone to blame then blame the management for not hiring more part-timers during busy periods, or herself for putting work over children. Packing gifts for another department is not my job nor am I paid for the evening hours doing it, so why should I stay? I have avoided doing this for the past few years and I am still hired, so this isn't against any company rules.

559,NTA,AITA For Refusing Pay For College For A Child I Have No Legal Obligation To Anymore?,"Throwaway Account

For the sake of length I'll try to stick to the facts and keep it brief. I (50m), legally have three children with my ex (51), Adam (23m), Chris (21m) and Sophie (18f). Biologically the first two children are mine and youngest is the result of my wife's infidelity. I discovered this the day when Sophie was two-years-old and we had to rush Sophie to the emergency room. I filed for divorce two months later.

I got 50/50 custody of my own children but since Sophie was legally ""mine"" I had to pay child support for her and was very bitter and resentful about it. I tried to fight it at first but in the end decided to suck it up to save myself the stress, but I made it very clear to my ex that outside of child support I would take no other responsibility for the girl and would shut down any attempts at being her father, but I would make the effort to still be polite to Sophie.

After some time I learned to trust again and remarried a wonderful woman who made it very clear that she and her daughter were a package deal. I accepted this and did everything I could to try and be there for my stepdaughter Katie (17f). Aside from the typical ups and downs I would say I managed to make a great family life for myself. We'd have family nights, I attended most after school events, took my family on fun vacations and put my sons through school and paid for their apartments and cars. They were own their own for gas money.

Chris is expected to graduate this coming summer and I made a silly post on social media about how relieved I was going to be that I only had one more kid to put through school left. A couple of days later I got a message from my ex asking me to pay for Sophie's college expenses on my own since the pandemic has made money tight. I asked her what she meant and referred to my post and I reminded her that my legal obligation to Sophie ended the day she turned 18 and that I was talking about Katie.

My ex was furious demanded to know why I was willing to pay for Katie and not Sophie since neither of them are related to me. I countered by saying that I knew upfront Katie wasn't my biological child and agreed to care for her instead of being conned into doing it like I was for Sophie. After that I got a call from Sophie asking what she did to make me hate her so much and to leave her feeling so excluded. I told her softly that I don't hate her and that nothing about this situation was her fault, but the simple truth is that it wasn't personal I'm just not her father. Since then my sons have told me that Sophie was becoming really depressed, my ex is blaming me but I don't see what I have to do with it AITA?

Edit: Just to be clear because I keep seeing the same questions

1. The kids know why I divorced their mother
2. My ex claims that Sophie was the result of a one nightstand and doesn't know who her father is, which is one of the reasons why I was kept on the hook for CS.
3. After I learned the truth I was very angry and didn't think I could handle raising a child that I was tricked into caring for so I decided to keep my distance.
4. Just because Sophie wasn't mine and I treated as such doesn't mean that I was horrible to the girl. I also made sure that my children knew that what happened between their mother and me was not Sophie's fault and they should never be mean to her.

Update: Mods didn't approve separate post so here it is.

&#x200B;

Thank you to everyone for their kind words of support. A lot of you have suggested therapy and for the longest time I never felt like I needed it, but after everything new that's happened I've decided that talking to a professional won't hurt. I thought I buried my anger and hurt toward my ex years ago but now new information has been revealed that's just making me angry all over again.

Not too long after my initial fight with my ex, she and Sophie got into a fight that ended up so bad that Sophie was kicked out of the home. Sophie called her brothers and they in turn called me and she is currently staying with my wife, Katie, and I. Apparently, in spite of my efforts to maintain a boundary, my ex kept telling Sophie that if she was well behaved and did good in school that I would think of her as a ""daughter"" again. It was my ex's way of getting Sophie to be obedient.

When I made my post Sophie thought that I was finally giving her the validation that my ex had always promised and when I didn't it was just chaos. Sophie called my ex horrible names and demanded to know who her bio dad. My ex refused and told her if she was going to be disrespectful she had to live elsewhere.

Originally, some of you suggested that in spite of Sophie's blood type she could still be my daughter and that was really starting to get to me. Now that Sophie was staying with me I took some of her DNA and sent it off for testing and couldn't believe the results that I sent it again for a second time. To my shock Sophie and I are indeed related, she's just not my daughter.

Like I said, the bad feelings are all starting to come back to me again but this new information is just putting me in a bad place again. I don't even know how or when to break the news to Sophie or how to even confront my ex about any of this. I feel like such a fool.",2020-10-16 05:52:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jc4cvv/aita_for_refusing_pay_for_college_for_a_child_i/,4285,6640,0.94,7
560,NTA,AITA for refusing to raise my brother in laws kids,"I (28F) have been married for 4 years. My husband (29) has a brother who is 2 years older than him, lets call him Ben. Ben has 2 kids (6yrs) and (9mths) with a woman called Amy.

When Ben was still with Amy, he was an a-hole towards her, he promised to marry her but never did, instead he cheated on her multiple times. So about 2 years ago Ben was caught cheating again and this was Amy’s last straw and they broke up. I should add Ben knew Amy was a few weeks pregnant at this point.

Amy who had been living with her mother decided to move closer to the city to look for work. soon enough she found herself a boyfriend and moved in with him, this caused Ben to become enraged. He threw another online tantrum saying he didnt want his kids being raised by a stranger, and even threatened to stop supporting the kids financially if they continue living with the bf. Amy resorted to sending her kids back to to live with her mother. unfortunately, a few weeks ago, Amy's mom had a stroke and is now incapable of caring for herself, much less the kids.

so now I found out that Ben asked my husband if we can raise his two kids for him. he says he doesn’t have the time to do it because he has to work as a teacher and come home to mark schoolwork. he says since I work remotely Im the only one capable of taking care of the kids. I refused and I'll give my reasons:

1. I already have 2 kids to take care of who are under the age of 3.
2. I dont want to have to spend any more time with Ben than I already do, he’s a misogynist, stupid brat. the fact that he thought it would be okay to speak to my husband only, about us raising his kids proves my point.
3. We have very different life views and parenting strategies and raising his kids would interfere with my autonomy in raising mine. For example, I bought my son a play stove and Ben made a lot of unnecessary comments about the toy being for girls Infront of my son. Thankfully, my husband told him to back off but this is just one example of why I think he's a bad influence for a child.
4. I think this whole situation is because of Bens incapability to grow up. i think he could care for the kids himself but he wants to live the bachelor life and continue drinking with his friends instead of raising his own kids.

this is why my husband disagrees: I told him i might have been willing to raise the kids if Ben and Amy were dead or if they were incapable of caring for the kids because of something they can't control, but Im not willing to raise them just so the parents can do other things . This made my husband say that Im punishing the kids because of the parents mistakes. he says he feels that both Ben and Amy are not good enough parents because Ben drinks too much and Amy introduced the kids to a bf she had only known for a short time. he says if you see kids suffering you should be willing to step in, even if the parents are at fault, the kids are innocent.

edit: Im sorry if this is not the proper way to post an update, I'm still not used to this app. I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who commented on this post, and thank you for the awards. I havent been able to respond to many comments as i have been very busy and I didnt expect to receive so many but I let my husband read the comments. He was a bit pissed that I wrote about the situation but now understands my point of veiw a lot better. Right now the kids are with Ben because its the beginning of summer, where we live and the school holidays are about to start, so he wont be teaching anyway. I have made it clear to my husband that Ben needs to use this time to start looking for a nanny or daycare. I havent bothered to say this to Ben since he didnt bother to speak to me in the first place. 

I will post another update with the outcome for those of you who are interested. Until then, Cheers!!",2020-11-22 10:07:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jytd58/aita_for_refusing_to_raise_my_brother_in_laws_kids/,465,3267,0.97,3
561,NTA,AITA for telling my fiancee I will not tolerate racism or homophobia in our house and if guests cross a line I will ask them to leave?,"Title says most of it. I had a conversation with my fiancee and told her that I don't want to create an environment in our home where racism or homophobia is tolerated, and that we have the right to create an environment in our house that visitors need to respect. I brought this up because we have guests coming to dinner and though I don't expect this to be an issue I want to be on the same page with her in case it becomes one.

The trick is that there's a major cultural divide. Without getting to specific, there is a lot of implicit racism and homophobia in my fiancee's culture and she has told me that many of her friends say things to her that they would never say to me. She tells me that I just don't understand the culture, that they aren't doing any harm and it's just words, and that if we put this rule in place then none of her friends could come over and I would be cutting them all off.

As an example, she asked if I would ask someone to leave our house if they called black people ""monkeys."" I said yes absolutely, that's over the line and not acceptable in our house. She told me that that is just how some people are and it's not harming anyone and that I'm not flexible, and rejecting her culture -- and also that it's always my beliefs and values that control and dominate what we do and how she acts. I'm kind of blindsided by all of this. I do understand the difference between ignorance and malice, but at the same time I'm not comfortable having this kind of language and bigotry in our home. We don't have kids yet so I feel like I can tolerate more, but it's not acceptable to me for our future kids to be exposed to that kind of language and those ideas. Our conversation got pretty intense and somehow my values and boundaries just got swept by the wayside?

Am I being too inflexible? I don't want to cut off our friends from her culture and I don't think they're bad people, I just don't think that bigoted language and views belong in our house and that we have the right to set that limit.",2020-11-12 17:09:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jsyhbd/aita_for_telling_my_fiancee_i_will_not_tolerate/,877,3679,0.93,7
562,NTA,WIBTA if I stopped my daughter's biological father to have her for the weekends until he follows my condition?,"This is a throwaway account and I am on Phone.


I (32F) had a child at the age of 16 with a 20 year old guy (Isaac)  and he ended up giving up his rights few months after the birth of our daughter.

Now, he came back in her life when my daughter was 12 and she wanted to meet her father and spend time with him so Isaac and I decided that he can have her on the weekends. 

He has been a good dad ever since but recently he has made friends with some drug and alcohol addicts and he invites them to his house on weekends too.

 My daughter rather feels uncomfortable with them in the same house as her, as some of them are always drunk and tend to misbehave. She tried talking to her dad but her dad doesn't take her seriously and when I tried to talk to him. He argued that he can have any kind of friends he wants and I am no one to put a ban on it.

My daughter doesn't really feel comfortable going there on weekends when the house is full of alcoholic and they party all night.

WIBTA if I stopped the visitation until he makes sure his friends are out of the house when my daughter goes there?

Edit:- I have decided to stop the weekends visits completely , thanks for the people who commented their judgement.

563,NTA,AITA(27f) for telling my sister(19f) that she needs to move out because we want to convert her room into a nursery after our baby is born,"My sister has been living in our condo for the last two years since it is located in the city and is only a ten-minute drive from her campus. My in-laws gifted us the condo when we got married and the mortgage is all paid off, so we never charged her any rent. It only has three bedrooms and we use one for the home office, one for our bedroom, and let my sister stay in the third one.

My husband and I decided that we were finally in a good enough financial situation this year to have a baby and let my sister know that she needed to move out before the baby was born. We want to convert her room into the nursery. However, she’s been complaining to everyone that we are kicking her out in the middle of a pandemic and has been asking us to convert the home office into the nursery so that she can keep her room. I do feel bad for her since she’s had to take out a ton of loans to cover her college tuition already and the rent prices in New York are insane but we need our home office since we both work from home and feel like we have to do what is best for our baby first. AITA?

Edit: My husband and I have been waiting to have kids for years so waiting another 2 years for her to finish college is not an option for us. We both work from home and need separate rooms when we work as we do have a lot of meetings during the day. We never promised my sister that she could stay with us all four years of her college. But since we had the space and she asked, we were fine with her staying.

564,NTA,AITA for causing my boyfriend’s kids to stop eating his ex wife’s cooking?,"My boyfriend got divorced this past spring, and we started dating a couple months after the divorce was finalized. He has two kids (11 and 8) from his previous marriage and has 50/50 split custody. Because of the pаndemic I moved in with him pretty shortly after we started dating, since he needed help with the kids at home. This has actually worked out great: the kids and I get along fantastic, they are a total delight to be around.

Neither my boyfriend nor his ex wife could cook worth a damn (we’re talking spaghetti from a can/kraft mac and cheese level cooking here). I on the other hand am a massive foodie and love to cook, and now do 100% of the cooking in the house. **Here’s the problem: now that the kids know what real food tastes like, they’re absolutely refusing to eat anything the ex wife cooks for them.**

The ex demanded that I either stop cooking, or send her money to pay for the takeout she’s been having to buy for every meal. Obviously these are ridiculous demands, but to keep the peace I offered to cook enough extra food for the kids to take to the ex’s house to last for the week. This suggestion enraged the ex even more, who said that I’m insulting and undermining her as a parent, and that I need to stop acting like a mom to her kids. AITA here?

P.S. I know the dating timeframe looks sketchy and people will inevitably ask “did you have an affair?”, the answer is NO.

565,NTA,AITA for using details from my divorce in a book I wrote?,"My (38f) marriage ended 5 years ago after I learned my ex husband was cheating on me with someone who I considered to be one of my best friends. It broke my heart and I was angry. My biggest source of anger came from the frustration that I had to co-parent with him and the fact she was going to be my kids stepmom after everything she did to me. I was so angry that I wrote a novel and got a lot of my anger and frustration out in that. That book wasn't much but I self-published it a year after the divorce, thinking nothing of it. I made some pocket change on it and mostly forgot it existed. 

I didn't use their names or anything but there were some details that are unique to us or at least would be not be details in every cheating situation with a friend.

My ex's wife picked up my book during lockdown and they put the pieces together. I denied it but he said he knew it was me and he was furious. He was furious that I would put out something like that about them and risk the kids finding it. He accused me of trying to feed the kids information that would turn them against him and his wife. But the book was under a pen name that has nothing to do with me and my kids do not know I wrote a book. They also know their dad cheated. They were old enough to put the pieces together when dad moved in in June and was engaged in July. I have told them any issues between their father and I are not about them and they do not have to hate them for me. That conversation killed me but for them I had it.

Ex claims it was reckless and selfish for me to do it. I told him he had no right to judge me.

Do you guys think he's right that I should at least never have published it? Nobody else would know but the three of us and it's not all that huge. It sold very little and I'm not leaving copies in my home.

566,NTA,AITA for winking at a Christian girl?,"So I (18F) was in school the other day (how unusual I know) and we were discussing societal issues and after talking for a while we landed on being a gay person in this day and age in our country. 

My teacher mentioned a statistic that states that on average every tenth person is gay/not straight. upon hearing that the aforementioned christian girl snickerd and ""whispered"" loud enough so that everyone could hear it ""so OP is definitely one of those lesbians"" so I just turned around, winked at her and said ""you wish"" (admittedly I had that idea from an old tumblr post)

after I said it she turned pale and was clearly shaken, asking me how I could accuse her of such a thing. I just laughed and told her to loosen up a bit. a few classmates also laughed and she started crying and had to leave the classroom. at the time I didn't feel bad and I still don't (not really) but both my teacher and a few classmates told me after the lesson to go and apologise and I should have known not to say such a thing to her since she is very openly very Christian and being a gay is a big no no in her eyes.

I refused to apologise and I haven't spoken to her since (it all happened last Friday) but I still get some evil stares from her general direction so I'm wondering if I should just suck it up and go apologise

EDIT: So I won't apologise as this is what most of you agree on but I don't think I'll keep winking at her either hahaha it sure would be funny but I don't think I'll push it since she already seems to be at her limit...

567,NTA,AITA for knowing more about a subject a 60 year old man challenged me on?,"Sorry if formatting is weird, I'm typing it up on my phone. Also please dont post this anywhere else.

I (24f) am currently doing an MA in European History. This incident took place during an online class that is shared with all of the MA courses in the History department and involved an older student, round 60 years old that we will call Richard.

Everything is online now and where I live it is getting very cold and wet as is usual for this season. So I threw on my Red Bull Racing hoodie because I love Formula 1, I have been watching Grand Prixs since I was 10 and this hoodie is the coziest I own. I forgot to take it off before joining our class call a few minutes early to chat to some of my course mates about our thesis proposals that are due soon when Richard joined the call. Richard is in Military History and I have previously only exchange pleasanteries and hellos with him until yesterdays class.

Richard joined the call, noticed my hoodie and jokingly stated 'oh OP very nice of your boyfriend to let you borrow his hoodie'. I laughed it off and politely corrected him going, 'oh this old thing is actually mine, no hoodie robbing here'.

Richard did not like this answer. He followed it up with 'but you're a girl. You probably don't even know what that hoodie is about so it can't be yours'. Again I laughed this off and replied 'I've been following formula one for about 14 years. I actually prefer Mclaren but Red Bull is a good team too right now'.

I thought at this point he would drop it. That we could go back to just discussing random stuff while waiting for our lecturer to join. He didn't.

Richard proceeded to, in front of the 30 others in this call, tell me that I only like Formula 1 for how attractive the drivers are. That no girl could ever understand the complexity of F1 and I was obviously lying to show him up and wouldn't be able to tell the chassis from the rear wing.

This is where I might be the asshole.

At this point I was fed up and I answered him back. I pointed out that his question was ridiculous as the chassis was the base frame of an F1 car and explained how the rear wing is attached to help with the drag of the car and the straight line speed which is why they included DRS to help reduce drag and allow for over taking in straight lines or closing gaps in seconds. I also asked him not to refer to me as a girl, that we were all equal academics and to show some respect to the females in the class which he hadn't been (he tends to speak over us) and that I know more female watchers of F1 than men so his little rant was unfounded.

Richard at this point went silent and left the class.

I have been told that by speaking back to him in a public forum (our online class) that I am an AH because I embarrased an elder and it was petty to take offence and call him out for what he said to me. The AH move was that I called him out on how he was treating me and the other women in our class in front of our 30 peers.

Since talking to friends and classmates and my family, theyre split. Most of my classmates think I handled it politely and he was being an asshole. As do most of my friends. My mother however and some male friends think I was an asshole to talk back to an elder and should have just laughed it off and ignored him. That he was just expressing an opinion and I shouldn't have corrected him publicly. I don't think I was an asshole.

Edit:

Wow. Im actually really overwhelmed by this. I honestly thought this would get a few comments and then ignored. Thank you to everyone saying Im NTA and for the awards and votes. I really didnt expect this.

To the people asking why I would post this when Im clearly NTA as youve stated. Its because while objectively knowing I wasnt in the wrong I felt awful and guilty. I felt horrible that my reaction made him leave. Im dreading class next week. Im not a confrontational person by nature. I also dont stand up for myself and my family have been heavily criticising me for talking back to someone older and not handling it privately. Im not looking for validation. I genuiely felt when I posted this there was a chance I was being horrible. I am from a small catholic town where women are seen not heard and definetly arent encourage to speak against older people although this is slowly changing.

To the people saying this isnt true because the lecturer didnt react....I stated above that we started the call early. Our lecture doesnt join us till five past hour. We started the call early to discuss assignments while waiting for class to begin. This took place before my lecturer joined the call.

568,NTA,AITA for telling my sister I hated her birthday gift?,"(Note: This event was pre-covid, but I'm still getting shit for it)

I have an older sister who I have always had an incredibly strained relationship with. She likes to think that she's an authority over me and tries to parent me constantly, even now that we're both in our 20s. She also has never respected my interests and openly insults them, calls them stupid/a waste of time/etc. Fun times.

One thing that everyone in my family knows about me is that I don't like football. Sports don't really interest me in general, but I find football particularly boring and hard to follow. I don't watch it at all, not even the Superbowl, and every time I've been forced to watch it I've been bored out of my skull. 

On my birthday last year, my sister talks up this great present that she's giving me for the whole day, which turns out to be tickets for the whole family to an NFL game. At the time I am just like ""Uh...thanks,"" because it's actually 0% surprising that she would do something like this. The next day I ask if I can give my ticket to my boyfriend, who lives with us and likes football (Me, bf, my mom and dad live together, my sister lives separately.) She chews me out for asking and when I complain that she knows I don't like football, she says it doesn't matter because it's not about the football, it's about the experience of being together as a family.

Football day arrives and I begrudgingly went. I tried to pay attention to the game for the first 5-10 minutes or so but I truly just did not give a shit, and I don't even really understand the rules so I was not able to follow along at all. I ended up reading books on my kindle the entire time.

As we're leaving, my sister is chewing me out again for my ""protest."" She's saying that this was a gift for the entire family and I was being a bitch for not participating. At this point I'm tired, so I say something along the lines of ""Well you got me a pretty shitty gift considering that it's something you know I hate. If I got you a ticket to Comic Con 'for the family' you would have laughed it my face and you know it.""

...and yeah, I haven't heard the end of it since then, because apparently ""it's the thought that counts"" and I am supposed to show gratitude for a gift no matter what it is, especially an expensive gift.

569,NTA,AITA for refusing to name our daughter Karen?,"My wife and I recently found out we’re having a daughter. We hadn’t really talked about names before but we both agreed that each of us will retain veto power. When we did start discussing names, both of us wanted to name her after our late mothers. Her mom’s name was Karen and my mom’s name wasn’t a meme. I told her the baby can take my mom’s name as her first name and her mom’s name as a middle name, or have an entirely different name, but I can’t okay “Karen” as a first name in any case. She got offended because she just wants to honor her mother and thinks I have a problem with that. I just don’t want to set our daughter up to be bullied throughout her life. I told her I’d be fine with whatever first name she picks as long as it doesn’t lead to the baby being picked on later in life, but she’s pretty insistent on Karen.

Edit: Wow, I didn’t expect this to blow up. I thought I’d delete this since this issue is pretty much resolved now but you guys are clearly enjoying this, so I thought I’d provide an update. We had a talk about this and why she had such an emotional reaction to my veto. Ever since her mom died suddenly when she was only fourteen, she’s wanted to name her first daughter after her and she didn’t really ever consider that the meme might be a potential obstacle. By that point, I’d thought about it for a while and realized that, as many of the comments have pointed out, Karen likely won’t be a meme by the time she’s old enough to feel its impact. So I told her I’ll recant my veto but we should still reconsider it because it still has potential complications and we might just come up with a better tribute. While exchanging ideas, we realized that both our mothers very coincidentally had the exact same middle name, Elizabeth (well mine had two middle names, and Elizabeth was one of them, but still). It seemed completely perfect to both of us so we’re going with it.

570,NTA,AITA for telling my mother that my husband is not her replacement son?,"My parents have 2 kids, me (f26) and my brother Dan (m34). Dan had a rough time growing up and frankly, my parents failed him. As a teenager he struggled with severe addiction and mental illness and they did almost nothing to help him. By the time he was done with college, he had completely cut off my parents. To this day, Dan and my parents are still estranged. I on the other hand still speak to my brother regularly. My parents, especially my mom, take every chance they can get to “mourn” the loss of their son and act as though my brother wronged them by leaving. Dan has told me he wouldn’t mind reconnecting with them, but only if they reach out and apologize first. I’ve encouraged my parents to do this, but they insist that he betrayed them.

I got married early last year to my husband Jeff. We have a happy marriage and he is adored by all my friends and family, but I feel like my parents have been crossing some boundaries. For example, whenever we’ve gone to visit them, they insist that he sleep in Dan’s room, saying that their son (my husband) has come home and should sleep in his “rightful bedroom.” Before the pandemic, my dad would take Jeff out to sporting events and introduce him as his only son. Most of the pictures of my brother in my childhood home have been replaced by pictures of my parents with Jeff. 

The other day, my mom called to invite me and Jeff over for the holidays. I told her I wasn’t comfortable traveling during a covid spike. She was irritated but dropped it. THEN she called Jeff and begged him to visit without me because apparently “it’s cruel for a mother to be without her child on Christmas.” Jeff politely told her he wasn’t going to visit without me. She’s been emotionally blackmailing him ever since, sending him pictures of stockings with his, my mom’s, and my dad’s names on them and saying “but we already promised so-and-so that our son will be in town!” 

This felt ridiculous and unsettling, so I called her up yesterday and explained to her that she’s violating our boundaries, Jeff is not her replacement son, and no matter how much she pretends she doesn’t have an actual son, she does and it is her responsibility to make up for the damage she did to that relationship before it’s too late. She started crying and called me cruel for mentioning Dan and said I have no idea what it’s like to be a mother and it’s disgusting that I’m trying to deprive her of a son when she has already lost one by keeping Jeff away from her. My father agrees with my mother and Jeff agrees with me, though he doesn’t like to rock the boat and thinks I should apologize anyway. I thought I did the right thing, but now I’m really not sure if I went too far. AITA?

Edit: Thank you all for the support and advice! I appreciate it so much. I haven’t been able to sleep so I’ve been reading every comment. I don’t know if I have the emotional energy to post in justnomil yet but I’m reading a lot of what’s posted there and already feel less alone. My tentative plan is to arrange for me and Jeff to get individual therapy and maybe couples therapy later on. We’re going NC with my parents for a while. I’m also planning to invite Dan to stay with us over the holidays. I have a lot to make up for and I want to spend as much time as I can with him and let him know he’s loved.

Edit 2: Also in response to the people pointing out the gross incestuous implications behind this, with the way my parents talk about me and my husband, most people who didn’t know me growing up assume that I’m their daughter in law and Jeff is their son until one of us corrects them.",2020-11-15 22:36:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/juv3rl/aita_for_telling_my_mother_that_my_husband_is_not/,480,7193,0.98,9
571,NTA,AITA for not supporting my mothers business?,"Obligatory “on mobile, happened last year” statement.

My mother started her own chocolate making company a couple years ago. She has been moderately successful locally and enjoys what she does, overall, I’m very happy that she found something she loves to do and is passionate about. If I’m being honest though, I just don’t like her products. She makes 80-97% dark chocolate and I’m a sugary, cheap milk chocolate fan at best. She’s a little self righteous sometimes, she took a course on chocolate tasting which she compares to wine tasting (which I’m also not a fan of, I’m just not that classy lol) and says that to enjoy her chocolate there’s a whole process to sniffing each piece and letting it melt on your tongue, breathing a certain way to “taste the aromas” etc. She does not know that I don’t like her chocolates, it would break her heart. Whenever she has a new one I grin and bear it, and will always try it. She gives me tons of it and I thank her, and give it away to friends who will enjoy it and I encourage them to share with their friends and tell them where to buy it. I’ve told her things like “oh I still have plenty from last time you gave me some” to try to discourage her from giving me more because she thinks I eat it all, but she insists. 

Anyways

When I was pregnant last year I had an intense craving for these Belgian milk chocolate sea shells (if you know, you know. They have a hazelnut filling and are delish) and I couldn’t find them anywhere. I was talking to a coworker about my craving and god love her she went out of her way to 2 stores and found me a box. 

Here’s were I may be the AH. I went onto social media, tagged my coworker and said “I have the best coworkers!” And a photo of the box of chocolates.

My mother calls me within seconds of posting and says that if I had a chocolate craving I should have asked her! I said I know, but I wanted those particular Sea shells. She then spirals and tells me that I’m “directly supporting her competitors and it’s embarrassing” (this is a global brand, whereas she only sells in our community, but I guess I see her point?) I apologize that she sees it that way, and point out that I regularly share posts about her company, this was more about the gesture my colleague made. She huffs and hangs up. She then blocks me on all social media and gives me the silent treatment for 3 weeks. Eventually I have my baby so she comes back around. 

Flash forward to now, she asks how I’m doing, I say great, hows the business, and she says “it’s great, but I guess you don’t care since you’re all about the cheap stuff” and brings up the post. 

Is she being unreasonable? It’s been *a year*. I completely forgot about the stupid post, I left it up all this time and she’s still sour about it so I took it down. But AITA for mentioning other chocolate companies?

EDIT

A lot of people have said I should tell her that I prefer milk chocolate, believe me I’ve told her at least a dozen times but she keeps giving me hers to try and insists I’m just not “tasting” correctly and that I need to “refine” my palate because “milk chocolate isn’t real chocolate”

EDIT 2

Also I apologize, but for privacy reasons I will not be sharing my mother’s company name. Thank you for understanding!",2020-11-10 14:32:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jrly3x/aita_for_not_supporting_my_mothers_business/,752,6639,0.97,5
572,NTA,Aita for leaving the hospital while my wife was in labor?,"So my wife sometimes likes to choose her mom over me when her mom get all upset. I guess she doesn't like to see her mom sad even tho you can tell she is faking it. Like when we were gonna go on a relaxing date she cancled it because her mom wanted to go to the mall with our first born and when my wife said she had plans her mom sobbed crocodile tears and she went and said we can do the date later. Well we didnt go on that date till 2 months later because i didnt have days to take off when she was off. This is one example. 

So a few days ago my wife was gonna go into labor with our second and she had promised i can be in the room until my mil told her a whole sob story about how she can wait outside and is too impatient and my wife caved in and when i took her to the hospital i was ordered to stay outside with our son. Now at this point i felt very upset and angry so i called my sister and asked if me and my son could stay over for a day and she said yes so i left with my son went to the house got some clothes and left. I texted my wife that im staying over with my sister with my son and that we can talk after she feels better. 

After that i talked to my sister about it while my son was hanging out with his cousin and then my wife texted me saying what was going on. So i told her about how i feel upset that she keeps choosing her mom over me and that when she feels better we can talk about it further.

Shs understood and so for the past 2 days when im not at the house my mil is there to help and when im there i just do all the normal stuff and some house work. 

I was starting to wonder if im an ass because my wife looks upset and i just feel bad. Sorry if this was more of a rant or dosent maks sense im just not in the right state of mind

Edit: alot people people asked for an edit so here it is. 1. No i was not in a waiting room i was outside in the car with my 4yr son. 2. We had discussed that i would be in the room for a while even right before we went to the hospital. I had only found out i wasnt aloud in after the doctors asked who my wife wanted and mil pleaded to be in and my wife chose her.

Edit 2: to clear some more things up. We went with our son to the hospital because it was kinda unexpected that my wife was going into labor so we called mil to meet us at the hospital and pick up our son. and as she lives closer she got there before us. So we got there and then edit one happened and then we just left.",2020-11-10 18:50:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jrqvsm/aita_for_leaving_the_hospital_while_my_wife_was/,870,4749,0.96,2
573,NTA,AITA if I skip my brother's wedding because my wife isn't invite?,"Me and my brother have a good relationship. My wife and his fiance don't like each other. 

 My brother's fiance has always been a bit childish and has never appropriately dealt with confrontation; she's the type of person who can say rude things about others, but when something is said back she has a meltdown. She's opinionated, needy, and can be a bit phony. If she doesn't get her way she immediately goes into a bad mood. 

A few years back my wife was suffering from depression. My brother's fiance made a comment about one of my wife's family members. The comment was rude, but it wasn't personal or meant to offend. Fueled by uncontrolled emotions, my wife decided to tell her off, calling her out on her childishness and phony behavior. Both my wife and my brother's fiance traded some harsh words, a few b-words were thrown around. I realize my wife was wrong to blow up and start the arguement, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't happy that someone finally put my brother's fiance in her place.

Luckily my relationship with my brother was not impacted. My wife got over the arguement rather quickly, she didn't like my brother's fiance, but wanted to be cordial for my sake. However, my brother's fiance refuses to move on.

My wife and my brother's fiance would see each other at family gatherings, and at first would completely ignore each other. A few months passed and they would briefly converse with eachother if required. A few more months passed and they could be in the same conversation within a group, but my brother's fiance would purposely go out of her way not to include my wife. My wife would go out of her way to try to talk to my brother's fiance but she would completely ignore her. My brother's fiance would show everyone in the room a photo but skip over my wife. My brother's fiance would say bye to everyone when leaving, but not my wife. My brother's fiance would invite me to their house for parties, but tell me my wife was not invited. I haven't attended a party or event at my brother's since.

Half a year passed and my wife reached out to my brother's fiance, asking if they could move past things so a rift wouldn't be created in the family. My brother's fiance responded as expected, and said she wanted no part of making amends or my wife in her life. 

 Somehow my brother and I have still been able to hangout and converse as if there isn't a 10,000lb elephant in the room.

My brother had asked me to be a co-bestman along with our other brother, which in the moment I obviously said yes. I recently received the wedding invitation, and as you guessed my wife was not invited. I was a bit shocked and saddened. My brother and his fiance are set to be married in June (Covid pending) and my wife told me I should go. I have no interest in attending knowing she is not welcomed.

574,NTA,AITA for not allowing my sibling to see my kids because of a 'nickname' she calls me?,"My (33f) sister (36f) has always been slightly upset over the path I took in life. I got married, had two kids and was a SAHM (stay at home mom) for the past few years up until my divorce. She loves my kids (8M and 5F) and loves to brag about being an Auntie. 
My sister and I had a tough time growing up together  because of our own issues and were never really close. However, when she found out I was able to have a viable pregnancy, she got....weird. shes never had kids of her own and now refers to me as ""The breeder"", as I am the only one of my siblings to have kids. At first I brushed it off because it's weird but not really malicious. Or so I thought. When my youngest was born early she refused to show up because the middle name was a name she had wanted and I ""should have waited til she had a child to have another"" she now uses the name ""breeder"" to refer to me. I've told her I dont like it and to use my name. She has refused. At one point she called our mother and asked ""hows the breeder"" to which our mom told her to either call me by my name or hang up. She chose to end the call. 
I get she may be upset that I have kids and my heart goes out to her, but at the same time I feel like she cant say shes happy to be an aunt and loves my kids if she is constantly being mad at how she even has a niece and nephew in the first place. I have told her the name bothers me and she continued so I  all but cut her off. Her messeges get left on read and I bitch-block when she calls. I leave her out of social media posts involving my kids and dont take my kids to places if she is there. This has caused friction as my mother backs me up and is accused of only taking my side because I'm the breeder and gave her grandkids. ( my moms opinion on it comes down to ""they are your kids. Do what you want) 
I've gotten messages from her friends about how I'm a horrible sister and she misses the kids and I'm doing this because I'm the breeder and have nothing else to ""hold over her""  I refuse to back down until she stops calling me that but as her friends are using the term, I dont see it happening. So reddit, AITA?

575,NTA,AITA for reporting my BIL's sister to a HIPAA board for accessing my medical records?,"This happened a long time ago but it has nagged at me and made me question  if my actions were ""worth it?""

Many years ago, I wasn't doing very well mentally and was hospitalized. My sister and I had a rocky relationship but were just starting to get close again. When this hospitalization occurred, I was ashamed and did not want her to know, fearing it would destroy what took so long to repair. After I was released, my dad told me that my sister knew about it but she did not contact me, just checked in with my dad about me. I was 100% certain that the only person who knew was my dad and he assured me he did not tell her. It then dawned on me that my brother in law's sister works as a nurse where I was hospitalized so I called the hospital. I felt embarrassed about the accusation but they were very nice and took my concerns seriously.

A couple weeks later, they followed up and verified that she did indeed access my medical records without being my nurse. They said she was scheduled to meet with a board or a committee but they could not inform me of the outcome.

Since then, my sister and BIL have cut off all communication. I have written letters, tried calling her, etc. but I was blocked entirely. I did not intend to hurt anyone... I was more upset that this very sensitive and private subject was violated by an employee and I did not feel it was right of her to use her position to access my records and inform my sister. If I had wanted my sister to know, I would have told her on my own time.

However, I have missed meeting the birth of both my niece and nephew and lost my sister and friends associated with her. Family is very important to me as mine has been very broken and its heart breaking to not be included.

Was I in the wrong?

EDIT:I'm now realizing a large group of strangers are better family than my own. I was not expecting this to be so one sided because of the severe backlash I received from my own. I have been feeling guilt and remorse for too many years and I feel like I can finally move on and stop beating myself up for this. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. And please continue to share your thoughts and your stories. These discussions have the potential for healing, education and improved mental health.

576,NTA,AITA for not accommodating my sister in law who is visiting?,"I'm a 19 year old woman and I live with my boyfriend.

When I was 16, I developed an eating disorder. I lost weight and my period. It continued until my senior year of high school, when I decided I had to recover before I went to college.

I put a lot of work in, and I've gotten my weight up and my period back.

Mentally I'm still not 100% there. There were things that were holding back my recovery so I decided to fix them. I have a hard time stopping myself from looking at the calorie content of foods and then I don't want to eat them anymore. So (and I know this sounds neurotic), I get rid of all the nutritional information of food once I bring it into my apartment. I either sharpie it out, or I rip it off.

None of that is a problem normally. The problem comes in last week. My brother and his girlfriend are visiting and asked to stay with me. I don't know her very well but I was excited to see them so I said sure.  

Turns out she's on a diet. My brother had talked to her before about my ED, and I could tell she was careful at first not to mention anything triggering, which I appreciated. But then later that day we were in the kitchen together and she saw my sharpied out nutrition labels for the first time. She was clearly shocked and asked some questions about my ED.

Then she kept acting weird. Yesterday, she pulled me aside and told me it was hard for her to stick to her diet with no nutritional information, and that she was afraid she was going to gain weight. She asked me if I wouldn't mind stopping just for the three more days she was here. I told her I couldn't, but she asked later that day if she could keep some food in her room or a special part of the kitchen. I once again told her no. I thought it was over, but I guess she talked to my brother because he asked me too. I was ruder to him because I was tired of them asking. I snapped at him and I thought they would finally stop.

Well today I woke up to several things. One was a long email from my brother about how I had to take a step forward and trust myself. My boyfriend also told me how before I woke up, my brother had asked him to convince me. I thought I could just ignore it all, but when I went to go make myself breakfast I saw that my brother/his gf had put some low calorie foods in the pantry, which are exactly what I find triggering. I took it all and dumped it in their room.

When they got home, they asked me why. I yelled at them about how it was a huge violation of my trust. My brother said they were just trying to help me, and that eventually I was going to have to get used to nutritional information again. His gf also said that she was just trying to be healthy and how I needed to relax. Well, I told her that it wasn't healthy for her to be so obsessed with calories, and that maybe she was actually the one with the ED.

They stormed out. My boyfriend doesn't think I did anything wrong, but I'm wondering now. AITA?",2020-11-12 18:33:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jt05i0/aita_for_not_accommodating_my_sister_in_law_who/,704,5131,0.97,9

He already has a son from a former relationship with his Ex (25/f). Tbh, she hates us and wants us out of the picture. She's the kind of person to think everyone in the world is against her and therefore she made my fiancé up to be the bad guy (he really isn't, he's loving and caring and just wants to be in his son's life). Their relationship has been toxic from the start and since they split up (about 2 years ago) she's trying to separate them. In December we are also going to court to fight for custody because right now my fiancé doesn't have any (he was at university back then and lived a few hours away and she tricked him into giving her sole custody for the time being but never gave him his rights back). So much for the backstory.

&#x200B;

Since they are separated every gift my stepson received has been sold. She just tries to make money from it and he never gets to keep the stuff. While talking to my sister about this year's Christmas presents for our children I dropped this information and she told me to just put his name on everything (like getting it printed on a blanket f.e.). I thought about it and told my fiancè about it. He's okay with it but told me it could be seen as an a\*\*hole move. I just want to do what's best for my stepson and want him to enjoy everything he gets. I also want to gift something small to her (like chocolate) just to be nice but WIBTA if I did this?

EDIT: I'm in a good and healthy relationship. I know everything there is to know about the situation but I can't share all the details because I want to respect the privacy of the people involved. It's also not part of the question. I love my fiancé and we are in a good place. He didn't cheat with me, we met when they were already separated and he did have time to recover from the breakup. We know it seems a bit hasty to get married so soon but we want to because we love each other. There is no money involved except child support he's paying since day 1.

Last week I received a letter from the probate court informing me that I will inherit his old house and most of his assets. My parents inherited his apartment where he lived in his last years to be closer to us and my older siblings inherited only a small part of his fortune as far as I know.

My brother and sister weren't too happy when they heard that I had inherited my grandpa's old house. His house is worth a huge amount of money, we're talking nearly 2 million € and my siblings want a share of it. Yesterday evening when they visited they took me aside to urge me to share my inheritance with them. They think it is unfair I got so much more than they did and think it would be only fair to divide the inheritance by 3. I was reluctant, but they got pushy until my parents heard of this and sent me to my room to talk to my siblings. I don't know exactly what then happened but I heard loud voices and apparently my siblings left the house furious.

Now I don't exactly know why but I don't really want to share my inheritance. I feel like my grandpa wanted me to have it but I'm also not sure if I'm just being greedy.

WIBTA if I don't share my inheritance?

581,ESH,AITA for exposing a my cousin's boyfriend as a fake navy SEAL?,"I served in SWCC, Special warfare combatant-craft crewmen. We operate small patrol boats, and we work with SEALs, usually the people getting the SEALs in and out of places. Our training is quite similar to theirs, and when I heard that my cousin was getting married to a SEAL and when I heard about him, I knew he was a phony. The stories that were relayed back to me, and the shit I've seen from his post was just bullshit. I also heard that my nephew did more pull ups than him, 5, so I know that's horseshit. There's no Navy SEAL who can only do 5 pull ups. Bare minimum is like 10 or 15 to even get into basic training. 

I never got to meet this guy, and I think he was actually avoiding me because whenever I showed up he always left. I told everyone in the family my concerns, most just ignored me saying i misinterpreted what happened, I'm not a SEAL so i wouldn't know, these ignoramuses were just so stubborn.  Well I knew the only way to expose this fucker is to get outside help so I contacted Don Shipley, who is a former navy SEAL and he has a bunch of social media accounts and websites where he posts content of him exposing hundreds if not thousands of fake navy SEALs either by approaching them or calling them and blasting them online. Anyone who suspects someone of being a fake SEAL can submit their info to Don Shipley, he will contact you back with proof of him being or not being a SEAL as he as a record to a database of every navy SEAL. 

Shipley not only sends proof of him not being a SEAL, he also calls my cousin and he asks my cousin about his service. He calls him out on everything about how none of his service making sense, the main one being he said he was in seal class 111 which would've been like 40 years ago or something. I then sent this to everyone who was attending the wedding in a mass email chain. I was in one that had like 400 email addresses for the upcoming wedding attendees, as well as everyone on his facebook and ig friend's list. 

I have gotten so much hate from him and his family for this and my cousin is devastated knowing this man is a fraud and a liar, so is everyone else who grew to like him.

582,ESH,AITA (46f) for not making my (newlywed) husband pay for my daughter’s(20f) tuition,"My husband passed away 7 years ago due to cancer, and I’ve struggled to take care of my four kids (6f, 8m, 10m, and 20f) as a single parent, but I’ve always done the best that I can. We lived in a safe neighborhood, there was always food in the fridge, and I tried to take them out to games/movies or treat them whenever I could. However, I did have to work multiple shifts and I could not afford a babysitter, as a result my older daughter had to take care of her younger siblings after school most weekdays. She’s become very resentful towards me because of that and said I robbed her of her childhood, but I was not sure what else to do. I was working almost 12-14-hour days just to provide a safe environment for the kids and had absolutely no savings afterwards. It was a horrible situation, but I just had no money at all to put towards a babysitter.

My daughter left home when she was 18 and cut contact with all of us for the last two years. Some of my friends/neighbors offered to watch the younger kids while I worked some days, and I was in a better financial place at this point, so we were able to scrape by without her help. However, she reached out to me a couple months ago and said she was struggling during the pandemic and asked if she could move back in with me and I said absolutely. However, ever since she’s been back living with us in our new house, there have been a lot of fights over finances. My husband is a dentist with his own practice and makes very good money. My daughter’s been saying that he should help pay for her college amongst other things, like helping her get a new car, etc. This has caused a lot of problems between my husband and I and I told her that he doesn’t know her at all (she also refused to come to the wedding), and it’s not fair for me to make him give her money. She’s been causing a lot of fights at our house because of this and we’re at the end of our patience and close to telling her she needs to move out, AITA?",2020-11-15 15:17:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jundye/aita_46f_for_not_making_my_newlywed_husband_pay/,2440,6332,0.96,8
583,ESH,AITA for circulating a petition to have a child removed from my kid’s class?,"My daughter’s third grade class has a kid in it who has something gravely wrong with her. I don’t know if she’s chemically imbalanced or what the deal is, that part isn’t really my business, I just know that how it manifests is the child is highly disruptive to the learning environment. 

This girl will throw fits in the middle of class, total melt downs with cursing and shouting, that grinds instruction to a halt. And worse, she’ll be very mean (beyond cliquey. Like, needling into kids deepest insecurities and making them not want to come to school.) 

I brought my concerns to the teacher after my daughter outlined her initial few encounters with her and the teacher suggested some conflict management strategies for my daughter to try, which led me to believe it was an issue between the two of them personally (my child and this other one.) 

But then I found out from other parents that their kids reported identical issues with the girl. We all got together and spoke to the teacher and she said that while she really wanted to help us that she was bound by certain privacy laws about exactly what she could and could not say. 

So we went to the mother of the girl (specifically I and one of the dad’s did, so she wouldn’t feel bombarded but wouldn’t be able to brush it off as one rude parent’s misplaced blame.) 

She vaguely said that yes her daughter is “dealing with some things.” But that experts have recommended it would be best for her to work through them in a regular classroom environment and to learn norms being surrounded by her same aged peers. 

We tried to delicately communicate that her learning whatever she is was coming at the expense of all the other kids learning their academics and feeling socially safe, but she more or less said, in a kind but firm way, “Welcome to public school. Your kids are going to have to get along with all kinds of people.”

We first approached higher ups trying to instigate them to offer them an IEP. We were eventually able to find out they had been extended services and turned them down (and I don’t think we were even supposed to know that much.) 

We are now petitioning to have the child removed from the classroom. There is a camp that feels as though this is against the foundational principles of the education system. That everyone should be able to partake who wants to and if we don’t like it we should take our kids out instead of forcing them somewhere they don’t want to be or don’t feel is best for their child. 

Before this instance I would have completely agreed. So, now I’m wondering, am I the asshole for doing this?

I was angry hearing this because that is a discussion that her actual parents (Her father and I) should have together. I’m not sure why her stepmom would try and make that decision when she has no right to have any input.

Yesterday I took her to a piercing shop and let her get the piercing without informing her father so now he and his wife are unhappy with me and are calling me “childish.” But I simply don’t want some random woman to try and act like my daughter’s mother.

585,ESH,AITA for not helping a family because they wouldn't let me listen to my son's heart beat?,"Three years ago, my son got into an accident and was declared brain dead soon after arriving at the hospital. He was only 16, and this was devastating to his father and me. 

We agreed to donate his organs, and a match was found for his heart. The whole process was anonymous. The recipient did not know who we were, and we did not know the identity of the recipient. 

A few months after our son's passing, we received a letter from the recipient's father, relayed through the hospital. He thanked us, telling us what they had gone through and what having the heart meant to him. 

After a few weeks, we wrote back, communicating through the hospital. Several exchanges later, we all decided to reveal our identities and met in person. The boy who received the heart was 12. I cried when I met him. He seemed extremely shy. 

I asked if I could listen to my son's heartbeat, but his parents seemed very uncomfortable with it. I was in tears as I pointed out that my son had allowed their son to live, and all I wanted to do was hear my son's heart beat one more time. 

The father became very firm and said no. The visit was cut short and the family left. This was about a year ago.

Recently, the family reached out asking if we would be willing to get tested for possible liver donation, as neither parent was a match. I thought this was a huge ask, considering they wouldn't even let me listen to my son's heart beat. We said no, but then over the weeks they asked a few more times, saying they were desperate and that we could be their only hope. They even brought my son into it, saying not to let his gift be in vain. Honestly, that infuriated us and we continue to refuse. I realize they're desperate but this was just so difficult for us the first time, and now they're asking us for even more.

586,ESH,AITA For storming out of a dinner with my wife and her best friend?,"I went out to eat with my wife and her best friend. I don't like her friend because I think she's a very selfish,  self-centered, loud, and irritating person to be around, and her friend knows that I hold that opinion about her. There's a lot more to it than that, but this post would be much too long if I was to go over the more in depth reasons we don't get along. Anyways, because of my feelings towards her friend, they've been having issues within their own friendship. 

We all decided to go out to eat in order to make things better between us, and while self admittedly her friend did kind of annoy me throughout, I thought the dinner had gone well. That all changed when the bill finally came. We had already decided to go half on the tip, and while I put $15 down, she thought it'd be funny to pull out her purse and make a heart out of pennies for a tip. 

I saw that and asked if she was serious, to which she said ""well I just don't really believe in tiping"". That upset me so I pulled out my wallet, put an extra $10 down and started getting up to leave. Her friend said ""what did I do?"" and I told her ""I just don't feel like conversing with a piece of shit anymore"" and I went to my car. 

When my wife came to the car she began to yell at me. I told her I understood why she was angry, but that some people just don't get along and that I felt it was best that her friend and I stop trying to get along. I don't control my wife and she's allowed to hangout with anyone she pleases, so while I do see why her friend and I getting along would be ideal, I don't see why it's mandatory that we get along for their own friendship to work.

587,ESH,AITA for forcing my sister to move out of her bedroom?,"16M here with a 24F sister.

Growing up, she has always had a large big room with a king-size bed, plenty of wardrobe space, ensuite, etc. My room is tiny and can barely fit all my belongings in it. It's not ideal but that's just the way the house was built and there wasn't anything I could ever do about it.

Since January, my sister has started to spend an increased amount of time at her boyfriend's house. It started off once a week, then every weekend, and now it's to the point she won't come back for over a week at a time. When she does, it'll be for just a night and then she'll go back to her boyfriend's for another week.

I don't think it's fair her big room sits empty for weeks at a time while I live at home permanently and have a crowded, cramped, room. I've spoken to my parents who both agree with me in private that since she's never home, we should be able to swap rooms.

The problem is that my sister, although 24 years in age, has all the mental maturity of a hormonal 14 year old. When we told her about it she started throwing a temper tantrum and crying, before threatening to move out (she basically already is but whatever) and never see any of us again. My parents have never been able to deal with her and they immediately backed down and beg for her forgiveness. 

I don't think it's fair and I told her next time she's gone I'm going to move everything anyway.

588,ESH,AITA for telling my husband my children come first?,"I have two girls with my ex (36M). They are wonderful girls and my entire world. However they live with my ex full time while I get every other weekend and some holidays. 

Now my ex was just offered a job and it's a really good job and I'm happy for him however, it's in another state. And I'm pretty sure he's going to take it because it's in his home state where all his family is. 

It's also my home state, as that's where we met and my family all lives there too. So knowing that this is something my ex is going to do I decided to discuss it with my husband, and some options. 

I told him that if my ex does back there I would like to too, to be with my children and my family. Of course I can't expect him to immediately lift his life and move with me, but I was trying to figure out of there was way we can do this. At first he was treating it lightly and was like, ""yeah I'm sure you'll be able to visit them or see them at Christmas"" but when he really I was being serious he grew upset. 

He told me that he didn't want to move anywhere and that I shouldn't either, that our lives were here. And I agree, however my children are also my life and I know for a fact that I wouldn't be able to see them consistently anymore, because they would live so far away so it would be more rare that I see them. 

Anyways he called my selfish for not thinking with him and I told him if I was selfish I wouldn't have brought it up and made up my mind and then I told him that my children came first in my life. And now he's refusing to talk to me and claimed I was being self-centered and inconsiderate. 

So now I'm asking reddit, Am I an Asshole for telling my husband my children come first? And considering following them back to my home state?

Edit: some people have been asking for this information do here it is: I would like to explain that there is a reason I have visitation rights and that's because I have had a history of being an absent parent and not prioritizing my children in my life, I know that court will side with my ex. I am close to my children and I love them wholeheartedly, and I do think that this move (if it does end up happening but most likely it will) would be beneficial for them as it's closer to both our extended families.

Edit #2: I've gotten a lot of advice, and a lot of judgement. I do want to say that I am going to do some couple's therapy for me and my husband, I think that's the best way to do things

Edit #3: I'm adding this because I have been getting a lot of these comments and they're really affecting me, I forgot how hurtful the internet can be. First of all, I was an absentee parent. I was absent for the younger years, they are current 10-8 years old. I have spent years building back the trust and love of being a mother. I am on schedule to have 50/50 custody. Because of all this, my children are my priority and I would do anything for them.

Edit #4: last edit because I forgot to mention this. I am not trying to give my husband an ultimatum. This is not a yes or no situation..I love my husband and am going to discuss every option with him. And I am also going to go over my custody order to see if anything can be changed. Thank you everyone for your comments, it really made me think a lot and I appreciate it.

Edit #5: I can't respond to comments anymore so I will answer your questions here: my ex is ok with me having 50/50, we have talked about it, and we have discussed it. When it comes down to it, he wont fight. We have both decided this is what is best for the girls. Now because he is considering moving, this might change the way things are and I believe the best way for me to go is to follow my children. However there is obviously a lot to think about so we'll see how everything turns out.

590,ESH,AITA for not waking up my BF so he missed his exam?,"I (29f) was with my then bf (28m) for almost five years. We were not living together but saw each other on the weekends, mostly in his one-room-apartment.

He had this horrible habit of not reacting to any of his alarms, he always set up 4-5 (phone/tablet/radio...) but would just let them ring until they got off by themselves or put them off and get back to sleep again. He also was a night owl, meaning that he could work and concentrate best at night while I am more like a daywalker and like to do my things while the sun is out. I sometimes tried to wake him up from my home - called his landline phone (dunno if this is the righ term) and let it ring until he got up and answered me. This was mostly a sign that he was awake and would not continue to sleep again. Even though we sometimes had the case that he answered the phone and talked to me, then went back to sleep and couldn't remember that we even talked (note: he answered in his usual, but sleepy voice even to questions.) So you might get it: It was a pain in the ass waking him up. And when I could sleep in, I always sat straight in the bed when his alarms went off, since I'm a light sleeper. So I put them off, tried to wake him of by shaking him (gently) and talking to him. In 90% of the cases he was grumpy and he complained I wasn't gentle enough or annoying. But since he was usually late to his appointments I had to use harsh methods sometimes.

One day, when I was at my own appartment, I had a job interview the next day in a city where I had to go by train.  He had an exam the same day in the morning. So he asked me if I could wake him via landline phone as I did some times before. I agreed.In the next morning I was stressed, had my mind full of things to remember during the interview and was almost late for my train. So I forgot to call him.

When the interview was over, I remembered that he had his exam and called him after. He went full rage mode, said he overslept and missed the exam. And that it was only my fault that he missed it, that he couldn't trust me anymore with such important tasks and that he would have rather asked his mom to call him instead. Note: The possibility that he wakes up by landline phone is still only around 50/50.

I actually think it should only be his very own responsibility to wake up in time for an important exam and that my phone call would've just been an additional liveline.

But I wonder if I maybe am the asshole for forgetting to call?

592,ESH,AITA for yelling at my mom and unloading the whole truth in therapy?,"I'm (16f) in therapy with my mom. We started going in January but then stopped until August because of Covid so no real breakthrough happened until recently. We're going because after my mom married her husband I was not too happy and when she had my half siblings I was uninterested and she feels like I'm still not all in, so she wanted us to talk it all out and work through this together. I was so dumb to think it would go any kind of good and that she would finally listen because she has used it to say the same things over and over again, that she doesn't understand me, doesn't know why I had to be so negative about expending our family and how she did it more for me than anyone. She also keeps asking to have her husband in therapy with us and doesn't understand why the therapist agrees it should be just me and her for now.

So our last session was Wednesday afternoon and she was saying yet again how it bothered her that when she gave birth to the twins I was so disinterested and negative and how I hurt everyone with my actions and how she did everything in her power to make it better I got so mad. The therapist noticed and asked me if I was bothered by what she was saying. I started saying how I felt when my mom said I was never open with how I felt.

I got even more mad and started yelling that she never ever listens to me and that I never wanted her to get married and I hadn't wanted siblings. That if she wanted a new husband and more kids that was fine but she had asked me before if I was okay with her getting married and I said no, but she did it anyway and acted like I had said I was okay with it and then she expected me to be super excited she was having babies with someone who wasn't my dad and she wanted this happy kid who was so glad her family was moving on from her dad and growing without him. I told her if she wanted to know whether I really wanted it back then (4 years ago) then no. I didn't want her to get married. I didn't want younger siblings. I liked being an only child if I couldn't have a sibling from her and my dad and nothing she said or did would change how I felt at the time and acting like we really discussed how I felt when all these changes were happening was wrong because she heard what she wanted to hear and dropped the conversation entirely. I told her if she wanted to know how I felt when she told me she was pregnant then she should think back to what I said.

She's mad because of what I said and for yelling at her.

593,ESH,AITA for refusing to change my daughter’s last name?,"13 years ago, I was dating a woman (Shelly) and we had a daughter together. When my daughter was about 2 years old, Shelly moved out with my daughter and I haven’t seen either of them since. 

I can freely admit that at that point in my life, I was irresponsible and stupid. There was a court hearing regarding custody/child support, but I was out of town for work and didn’t go. I didn’t realize at the time it could proceed without me and I would have been fired if I flew home for it. In retrospect, I should have gone. 

Even though the court ordered joint custody, I’ve never been allowed to see my daughter. Shelly moved to another state and I didn’t know where they were for a long time. She’s ignored calls/messages from me and anyone in my family and no one in her family will speak to us either. 

I’m now married and my wife and I have a toddler together. A couple of weeks ago, my wife found Shelly on fb and reached out, asking if she would consider letting our toddler have a relationship with her older sister. Shelly wrote her back saying no. But she also asked my wife to please get me to sign paperwork to change my older daughter’s last name. Currently, she has my last name and Shelly wants it changed to hers. 

I’ve refused. I get that I didn’t make good decisions. I didn’t know what I was doing back then and couldn’t afford a lawyer. Once I was financially able to fight for my daughter, she was older and I was a stranger. I didn’t want to scare her and force her to be with me. BUT, I also don’t want to do anything that would make her or anyone else think I don’t want anything to do with her. I DO want to be in her life. If she turns 18 and wants to change her name, that’s ok. But I won’t sign anything to change it now. 

Shelly told my wife that my reaction is completely selfish and this is exactly why I’m not allowed to see her. Because I don’t think of what’s best for her. 

I don’t want to hurt my little girl. I’m sad af about this whole situation. Am I an asshole for holding onto this?  Or is it really better for her if I just let her change the name?

I never stopped working, thank god, and have a full-time job. My daughter is at daycare 3 days a week and my parents watch her the other two days.

This past weekend my parents were out of town and there was an emergency at work. I was called in with an hour notice and immediately called my sister, who lives about 10 minutes away, to see if she could watch my daughter. She said she could but her “rate” was $30 an hour. I was absolutely shocked that she asked for money.

I know she herself isn’t planning on having kids but she has always seemed happy to be an Aunt. I knew it would be at least a 10 hour day and I cant afford to just drop $300 unexpectedly right now. I begged her to take her without the fee but she refused, claiming that her time was worth money.

I ended up hanging up on her and calling a friend who lives quite a bit farther out. My friend happily took my daughter for the day, no expectation of pay. I was late to work though (and got a write up) because I had to drive so much farther.

My sister ended up calling me yesterday to chat, totally unbothered by what had happened. I told her that I was upset at her and didn’t want to talk and she unloaded on me. She told me that I was the one in the wrong for just expecting her to be free childcare. I told her that it was horrible of her to want money to spend a day with her niece and that I was going through a difficult time, emotionally and financially, and she was being unsupportive and selfish.

We ended the call on a sour note and haven’t spoken again since. Until yesterday I didn’t think for second that I was wrong to be upset. I don’t think its unreasonable to expect your own sister to help out once in a blue moon without needing to pay her. I also think its hypocritical of her considering she has 3 dogs that I used to watch for her when she vacationed without any pay. That was years ago before I moved but I feel like she should remember that.

Am I really the asshole here like my sister says?

TLDR: Wanted my sister to watch my daughter in an emergency and she wanted to be paid. I am upset she wanted pay and she is upset I expected her to watch her niece without pay.

EDIT: I took a break from this thread due to the hundreds of cruel and abusive comments and DMs I received. To answer your questions:

1. My sister has never babysat my daughter before. She was born when my ex and I were living across the country. I moved back home 1 month ago and my parents are my backup childcare.
2. Yes my job is shitty and my boss is shitty. My industry was hit hard and unemployment is high. I apply for every other job I can find but no luck.
3. When my boss called they said ""You need to be here in an hour tops or there will be consequences"". I was extremely stressed when I called my sister.
4. I brought up the dog sitting because I wanted to illustrate that we used to have the kind of relationship where favors were done without a fee. I was absolutely blindsided when she asked for money.

Update for those who care: My sister ended up telling my parents about what happened and she got chewed out. They called me and told me they were ashamed of her behavior. Take what you will from that.",2020-10-29 13:49:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jkad2h/aita_for_expecting_my_sister_to_watch_my_daughter/,1017,1124,0.92,3
595,ESH,AITA for telling my daughter and ex son in law that I don’t want custody of their daughter either?,"My daughter and my ex son in law had a four year long divorce for a marriage that lasted barely a year. 

In that time, their daughter (14) has acted out. My daughter found her lying on the couch black out drunk for the first time when she was 11. 

My ex son in law recently had a week with her in which she refused food for 4 days in a row.

I haven’t had a much better time with my granddaughter either. Once I drove her to a birthday party and she ended up pulling a 24 hour disappearing act until finally a friend admitted she was with him.  

And the worst part is that many of the daughter’s problems weren’t reported by either side because both my daughter and ex son in law feared that the other parent would lose all custody and they’d have to deal with her full time. 

Now my daughter and son in law are at their breaking point. They both are arguing that they don’t want custody and that the daughter is the other’s responsibility. They have both gone as far to threaten to get themselves arrested so that they’d lose custody. My daughter even said that she was contemplating purposefully driving drunk and getting pulled over with her daughter in the front seat so she’d lose custody. 

They finally turned to me and begged that I take her in. My ex son in law stood outside my house yesterday in the pouring rain for a full hour begging me to take my granddaughter in until he finally went home. 

I finally emailed the both of them and said that I was one year away from turning 60 and had already planned my life in a way that doesn’t involve a child. 

I ended it by saying that if they both wanted their child to be living anywhere besides their homes, then it would be in a foster care facility. 

AITA? My daughter and her ex were teen parents but honestly this is such a mess and their daughter is such a mess that I don’t feel it’s fair to make me deal with the destruction they caused.",2020-10-11 23:36:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/j9g109/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_and_ex_son_in_law/,1173,6302,0.96,6
596,ESH,AITA for not letting my wife spend my redundancy pay?,"This is a throwaway because my wife uses redit. Though I don't think she looks at this subreddit.

So. Due to the current circumstances in the world, my previous company down sized and I was made redundant. We were given 2 months notice because the company was amazing like that (They didn't want to let us go but had to) so I had time to have another job lined up and thus our income didn't actually take a hit so as far as I was concerned that money is fun money.

The pay was £8000 and I had planned on using a part of it to build a home made electric car with our son, from the base up, so going as far as welding the chassis. So I estimated we would need about £4.5-5k. So I put 6k on the side for the car in total. Which I was then going to use the other 2k to put towards a family holiday once everything settles down.

I told these plans to my wife and she got up set. Claiming she had planned (and already promised) the money to be used for an expensive spa week over in the EU for her and her sister for after Christmas because her sister was depressed about having to cancel a wedding.

I told her that wasn't going to happen as it was my money, especially since she just promised it without consulting me first.

Well, an argument ensued and she called me an a-hole and told me that a ""kit car was a waste of money since it couldn't be used on the road"" which is neither true, nor false, and that ""If I was adamant that she wasn't allowed to take her sister on the trip then I had to tell her sister""

She completely ignored that it was going to be a project between me and our son who has just turned 12 this year and has developed a massive interest in cars.

PS. before people start commenting. My wife isn't generally an EP. She is normally a lovely women. Though she has a fiery temper at times. I am 100% sure this is a one off due to her being disappointed.

&#x200B;

Edit:   
I kinda agree with the posts that ESH but not because ""It's not 'My' money but 'our' money"" but because it is a lump sum and they rarely come into the house. 

When it comes to spending money, we typically have an arrangement of ""I pay the bills, needs and general groceries and then anything left is mine"" while she doesn't have a stable income her self, she does earn off hobbies. That money is hers, the excess in my wages are mine. If there is something she wants/needs that is extra to things that come out of the household budget, i.e. toiletries, and she can't afford it her self, or has little to no fun money that month, I will split my money with her so we both always have money to do what we want. 

We sat down and talked about it after dinner today and chose to split it 50:30:20 

50% for me as it covers the cost of building the car and I am doing with our son. 30 for her because it 3k is MORE than plenty for a spa day in the UK for 2 people. It will leave them money for a meal even if they can't go for a weeks vacation, and then the final 2k will be put in next years holiday fund. 

Also. Apparently she does read AITA because she came into my office tapping her feet. I had PTSD to my mother finding me playing with matches. Though it was what turned into us having a proper, civil discussion over the problem.

597,ESH,AITA for shaming a friend of a friend for not having money to eat?,"My friend ""Nick"" is friends with ""Joe."" I am cool with Joe, but he is less a friend and more of an acquaintance. I know he is having a lot of family drama and has been couch surfing since his parents kicked him out. He has no job and doesn't go to school. I understand how not having a stable roof over your head can make that challenging.

I do work and go to school. I don't have much money at the end of the month because I help my family out with rent. I like to go to IHOP on the weekend to reward myself. If I go with friends, one person usually pays the tab, but all pay for our portion plus contribute to a tip at the same time. Point is that money is tight with me.

This morning I went to IHOP with Nick and Joe (he sort of invited himself as he is staying with Nick and his family right now). My meal was like $11, Nick's was $9 and Joe's was $15. I offered to put it on my credit card and Nick gave me a $10 for his tab. Joe just shrugged and said he had no money but would pay me back ""later."" That pissed me off. I asked him ""oh so you found a job? When do you get paid?"" He laughed and said he had no job. I asked him how is he going to pay me back and he said not to worry. He was shameless and nonchalant about it.

Finally I told him that it was a total dick move to invite yourself to breakfast knowing he could not pay and would not pay me back. I told him I don't even know him and to do that to someone you don't know means you're very likely not to pay them back. He laughed so I said no wonder his family disowned him.

Nick told me that was a low-blow. I asked Nick then to pay me back and he said he didn't have anymore money and that's not his problem.",2020-11-07 09:48:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jpo66l/aita_for_shaming_a_friend_of_a_friend_for_not/,305,2173,0.97,0
598,ESH,AITA for sticking up for my girlfriend?,"My mom is a child carer and does this full time. I've started seeing a girl who is a hair dresser, she's really kind but sometimes this is her downfall. I invited her round to meet my mom and I was horrified to see that when we walked into the lounge my mom had all her hair stuff ready and brought a mirror in. I asked what she was doing and she said ""what better way to get to know eachother than her do my hair"". This was even before they'd been introduced. My gf had some stuff in the car and brought it in, she said it was fine but it was kind of awkward. I didn't want to make things worse by having a full blown argument with my mom on the first time shed met her. Anyway the whole treatment took over an hour and my gf said it was easily a 200 dollar job. My mom even had the nerve to ask her to do her nails, I couldn't believe it as I've never seen this side of her. She then said as she was leaving that she'll give her 20 bucks next time we see her. I was livid as she didn't seem like she put much effort into getting to know her at all. Anyway, my gf has 2 kids from a previous marriage I get a long with them pretty well and I was due to look after them, I phoned my mom and asked if she had any plans for the rest of the day and she said no. I drove the kids round and just told mom ""what better way to get to know them than looking after them for 24 hours"". I could see she was annoyed. She phoned me a few hours later and said that I should come get them, I told her I'd had a few drinks so can't but it's her job to look after children so I thought she'd be able to do it in her free time aswell, just like my gfs hairdressing. She got the point I was trying to make and she said I was well out of line for doing this. I told my gf about it and we both agreed that she's a bitter old woman who is selfish and vile who has a look in her eye saying that she hasn't been fucked properly in years. My mom won't speak to me now but I'd rather make the point than her walk all over my gf.",2020-11-15 12:16:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jul0m1/aita_for_sticking_up_for_my_girlfriend/,175,1507,0.91,3
599,ESH,AITA for not talking to my family and refusing to go to therapy after losing two of my children last year?,"Not sure where to start with this. I have three children, one still alive who is a 15 year old girl. I had her when I was 18. In 2008, I had another girl and in 2010 I had my son. 

About a year after my son was born, he quickly began to regress. He wasn’t hitting his milestones and my husband and I became increasingly concerned. After about an 18 month long battle with doctors, we received a diagnosis of INADS (Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy) which in layman’s terms is basically Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s for children. It’s a terminal illness, with a life expectancy of 8-12 years. I had prepared from the second we received the diagnosis to one day lose our son, and dedicated my life to becoming his caregiver, giving up my job and being by his side 24/7 to care for him. In January of 2019 he passed away. 

About two months later, our younger daughter was diagnosed with Glioblastoma Multiforme which is a malignant brain tumour at stage 4. I was still in a complete daze after losing our son but after six months of intense treatment, our daughter passed away. 

Towards the back end of last year, I went slightly off the rails. I was drinking heavily and smoking weed pretty much every night just to make me forget what was going on. My husband took the opposite approach and immediately went to therapy, as did our eldest daughter. In January of this year, I decided I was going to get my shit together as my 15 year old daughter is still depending on me, but I refuse to go to therapy or talk about my children. 

This has obviously caused some tension between my husband and I, and his parents. His parents are living with us at the moment, much to my dismay, and try to bring the children into every single conversation we have, which I cannot stand. Last night during dinner, I ended up snapping and telling his parents that if they kept bringing them up they should leave. 

It led to a huge argument between my husband and I, with him saying I’m being selfish in my grief and that I should allow his parents to grieve in the way they want to, even if it comes at the expense of myself. I ended up leaving and staying the night with my parents who live a few streets away. My husband has been sending me pretty harsh messages all day, as have his parents.

600,ESH,AITA for telling a coworker to either lock her kid in the closet or call back when we can get some work done?,"I work with a team of 10ish people, and we're all WFH for the foreseeable future. My company has gone above and beyond to cater to the people who have kids, which is totally understandable. Flexible hours, last-minute changes, etc. 

We've all done a pretty good job of switching gears here. Most of our Zoom meetings are done within 30 minutes to save everyone the trouble. We do weekly one-hour check-ins to make sure everyone know what everyone's up to, if anyone needs help, etc.

Jamie has three kids. Two of them are old enough to where they're doing virtual school, and are polite. The third kid, the youngest, however, is in that bratty little kid phase where they make nonstop noise, and if Mom isn't paying attention, it's the end of the world.

We're *tried* to be accommodating. But every meeting, when it's her time to talk, it's endless screaming and MOM MOM LOOK AT THIS MOM WHY AREN'T YOU PAYING ATTENTION and then ""cute"" interruptions like the kid getting up in the camera so we see up his nose, yelling HI over and over when she's talking etc. 

She's been told a number of times to please make sure she carves this one hour out of her week so we can work together, professionally, as a team. Yet every week she gets all sheepish and ""I just can't so no to him"" and shit like that. 

I finally snapped this week. I'm waiting on a huge project from her, and she needed to explain where she's at so I could be prepared for the hand-off and to take control. In the middle of her explanation, the kid just starts going ""WEEEEEEEEEEEEE"" as loud as he can in the room, swinging around a toy. 

I couldn't hear shit except the ""wee!"" and I just... I'd had enough and muted Jamie and said ""I'm done wasting my time here, let's move on until Jamie finds a closet to lock that kid in so we can actually get some work done.""

Other people on the Zoom call either cracked up laughing or looked uncomfortable. I get it, putting her on the spot like that was rude. But at the same time, forcing the constant ""WEEEEEEE"" and noisy interruptions and ""cute"" antics of the kid on your coworkers who are just there to get work done is beyond obnoxious.

Jamie went off crying to our supervisor, who ended up saying essentially the same thing as me, just with more tact. It's been an issue since this all started, and I'm not the only one who has lost their cool with Jamie over it. 

However, *some* of the people with kids (not all of them) have ""banded together"" to complain that we're putting too much pressure on Jamie and that it's unfair to expect she would be able to ""just turn off being a Mom"" like that. 

All I'm asking for is a for a quick, professional meeting. None of this ""WEEEEEEE!!!!"" and ""cute"" interruptions by someone's kids. AITA?",2020-11-10 22:06:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jrurjz/aita_for_telling_a_coworker_to_either_lock_her/,316,650,0.93,1
601,ESH,AITA for telling my mom how big my bf is downstairs?,"I love my bf of 2 years but my mother really doesn’t like him for very shallow reasons. Bf is pretty short at 5’5 and is kind of shy. I think his height is fine since I am only 5’1 and he isn’t shy when it’s just me and him or other close friends. My mother is always asking me if I really am attracted to him saying things like”Don’t you think he’s too short for a man?” or mistakes his shyness for being boring. Well the other day I got to my breaking point. She was asking her usual stupid questions but I couldn’t handle this disrespect towards my bf any longer. She was saying”Really baby, why him? You could have much better men. My friend has this tall, handsome dentist son who has seen a picture of you and thinks you are cute. You are missing out.” This obvious disrespect upset me a whole lot so I said to my mother”I’m with him for his long fat beautiful dick. You happy to know that now? I doubt Mr.Dentist is even half as big.” And I ain’t lying either, all that missing height went somewhere else.

Well this makes my mother change color real quick. She’s all like Ew and saying she didn’t want to hear that. Well she shouldn’t have kept pestering me for why I like my bf is what I tell her. Mom immediately drops the subject and says she is gonna have a hard time looking at my bf now without feeling embarrassed. Am I an asshole for what I said to my mom?

602,ESH,AITA for yelling at my mom when she made me breakfast before a test?,"I am fully prepared to be called TA, but please hear me out.

Since quarantine started, my mom (47F) has had the privilege of working from home. Almost every day, she makes me breakfast. At first, it was nice, but after a while, I told her that I (18F) will be moving out soon for university and I'd like to learn to make my own food (at least my own breakfast). I told her that if she really wants to, she can make breakfast over the weekend, but during the weekday, I'd like to make it myself. She agreed. This was back in April/May 2020.

Over the months, regardless of me telling her not to make me breakfast, she makes it and brings it to my room. Throughout the months, I've also told her multiple times that I don't like it when she brings food (whether it be breakfast, lunch, or dinner) to my room because it makes my room smell, distracts me from my work, and makes me feel guilty. Every time she brings food to my room, I end up eating it whether I'm hungry or not just because I don't want her to feel bad.

Sometimes when I'm working, she brings up lunch/dinner, and although there are times where I thank her for bringing me food, most of the time, I remind her that (1) I want to learn how to remind MYSELF to eat to prepare myself for moving out and (2) the other reasons I listed above.

Despite me reminding her hundreds (I swear I'm not exaggerating) of times to not bring me food, she still does it. This morning, I had an 8:00 am test for one of my classes. After coming out of the shower, I saw that she had placed breakfast on my desk. My room smelled like food which was created a distracting atmosphere for me to write the test. When I went to pick it up, the knife slipped from the plate (she gave me pancakes) and fell onto my carpet, spreading syrup everywhere.

I had 5 minutes before my test started at this point, and I was really frustrated. After quickly cleaning up the mess, I went downstairs and I yelled at her telling her that she needs to understand my boundaries and keep to her word. She has said multiple times that she will not bring me food and yet she keeps doing it week after week.

I feel bad because it was a thoughtful action and I love my mom, but I have told her so many times on multiple occasions to stop. Reddit, AITA?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**UPDATE**

Last night, I apologized to my mom for yelling at her about me dropping my knife. I told her that it was my fault, and I shouldn't have gotten upset at her over that specific point. I also explained to her exactly why I didn't like her making me breakfast (most of the reasons I outlined in my comments). She apologized and said that she'd try her best not to continue making me breakfast and let me figure it out on my own at my own time. She also said that she continues to do it because she feels bad when I don't eat right when I wake up. I explained to her how it makes me feel nauseous and sleepy, and how that's a bad combination before 8:00 am lectures. 

This morning, she made me a heavy breakfast. Take what you want from that. 

Thank you to all those that provided their opinion, I really appreciate all perspectives. I tried to respond to the most common perspectives as well. 

**EXTRA INFO**

1. I didn't mention my struggle with mental health to paint my mom as the villain after I noticed that people were calling me TA. I came here fully prepared to be called an asshole. I didn't mention my depression or OCD just so people feel bad for me. I mentioned it as a context - I've requested her to change her mindset on mental health and she hasn't. I thought it was necessary to mention that, as this breakfast request seems a lot smaller in comparison. I'm sorry if it came out as if I wanted her to look like a bad person, she's a lovely mother in many aspects, but she has a hard time to change her mindset on certain things.
2. I don't have any history of eating disorders
3. I make my own lunch and I help my mom with dinner most days. I also eat dinner with my family. I'd eat lunch with them too, but my mom prefers to eat in her room, so I usually eat lunch alone in between my lectures.
4. I usually don't eat breakfast in the morning, which is why I've asked her not to make it. Whenever I am hungry in the morning, however, I put together something to eat, as long as she hasn't already made me food. 
5. I have been 'enabling my mom' because wasting food is a big NO in my family. No one else will eat her breakfast (since she doesn't eat breakfast, and my dad makes his own early in the morning), some not eating the food would be considered a waste. I could put it in the fridge to eat as lunch, but that would take away from me wanting to make my own lunch as well. 

Many of you have been calling me a spoiled, entitled, brat. I respect your opinion since I came here fully knowing that I might get stuff like that. However, I do think it's important to note that ONE situation doesn't define a person. In this particular situation, I may have come out as a spoiled brat, but that doesn't make me one in general. Again, nothing I can do about that since that's what I came here for. 

As for my mental health issues, I've been seeing a therapist and trying to work things out with my mom. Thank you to all of you that shared their own stories. I hope you all can get a good, homemade meal soon. Take care!",2020-10-28 15:05:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jjpff9/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mom_when_she_made_me/,523,1359,0.93,0
603,ESH,AITA for calling my wife a bitch when she made comments about my sister’s boyfriend’s eating?,"My sister (K 17) and her boyfriend (R 17) both live with my parents after my parents adopted R when he was 14 to help him escape a toxic household. He’s part of the family now, and I consider him to be my little brother. I (26m) usually (pre-c) would hang out with him often, and throughout quarantine we’ve been playing video games and voice calling several times a week, as he needs a big brother figure and I’m happy to be his. 

My wife (27) and I have known him since my sister met him at school when they were 12, and he was always frighteningly thin. Turns out it was because of lack of nutrition, and once my parents took him in and fed him properly he was a healthy weight. However his bio parents gave him some messed up views about food that led to him developing an eating disorder when he was around 14-15, and he’s been working on this and other things with a therapist, and he’s doing really well now, and I’m glad. 

Main point of that paragraph ^ is that my wife knows how much he’s struggled as she’s witnessed it all with me, and should know not to comment on his eating.

This thanksgiving my parents, K and R, and my wife and I got tested for you know what, and we were all negative, so we decided to have a socially distanced thanksgiving in my parents backyard. Things were great, R was eating a good amount, no one said anything because of obvious reasons, and life was good. Until my wife starts in.

“Wow R, you’ve really come a long way from when we first met you. Remember when you would only eat if someone gave you permission? Haha, glad you’re not like that anymore. (She said a few other things like this but I forget the exact words she said. Just bringing up past things he used to do for his ED that he’s obviously sensitive about.)

My parents and sister were just kind of in shock, and R’s face was red and he was just kind of looking down at his plate. I figured no one wanted to say anything to my wife, so I did. 

“Why are you being such a bitch? The past is the past, just let people eat. It doesn’t matter anymore.” 

My wife looked at me with a shocked pikachu face, and left the table to sit in the car. I finished eating (we were almost done), said goodbye to my family, apologized to R for my wife’s comments, and went to the car to meet my wife. She obviously called me an AH, and I said I didn’t regret calling her what I did because she was being a bitch and should’ve known not to say that.

Me: Hi how are you

DG: hi I’m good

He then hands me the pizza and I thank him and wish him a great day and I politely close the door and head inside to give some pizza to my little brother and niece, I then hear knocking at the door.

My brother and the delivery guy started arguing a bit and my brother started cursing him out, but I just said sorry to the delivery guy and closed the door. My brother called the dominos and complained about the guy, then we just ate pizza.

So AITA? Should I have handled this any differently? I feel bad but still a little mad.

605,ESH,AITA for standing my family up after they didn’t invite my girlfriend to my birthday party?,"A week ago I turned 23. I’ve been with “Ry” (nickname) for 5 years, engaged for 2 and living together for 3. Ry is 27.

Ry has really been my rock; she encouraged me to go university, let me move in with her when I couldn’t cope with my parents and gave me the push I needed to accept myself and be happy, she’s just this great woman but maybe I’m biased!

We’ve never been a family to really celebrate birthdays, I’d get something small and a card and that would be it. But for whatever reason my mother wanted to celebrate this birthday and I agreed, let her and my sister (30F) arrange everything.

A week before my birthday I get told that Ry wasn’t invited because my grandmother and mother don’t like her (age difference and they think she “turned” me) and that maybe we could do two meals, one with my siblings and Ry and one with my family but then my other sister texted me, an hour later, saying she’d talk to the family about inviting Ry.

A few days before my birthday she said it was a no go but they’d arrange something else to include Ry.

Ry was fine with not being invited but I’m not, I just decided to drop it and just didn’t turn up.

Now my family are texting me saying that I’ve embarrassed them and that I could’ve done something with Ry later on and that I’m being manipulative. I’d ignore this but Ry is upset that I’ve made them think she’s behind this and they’ll blame her for it.

**Sorry for not making it clear, I am a woman, not a man, so yes them accusing her of turning me is them accusing her of turning me gay**

606,ESH,WIBTA if i gave my son a very similar name as my sister-in-laws dead son?,"I’m 25F and about to have my first baby with my partner (its a boy!).  I've long wished to name my child a certain name, lets say that it is 'Tom', after my grandfather who basically raised when my parents dropped the ball.

&#x200B;

The thing is that my sister-in-law lost her baby five years ago, let us say he was named Thomas. Thomas died in his sleep when he was four months old and the whole family was devastaded. I know that his death still causes them very much pain and I get that they don’t want to be reminded of him dying all the time. So, I asked them if it was okay that I named my son Tom, since it is a similar name to their son. 

&#x200B;

Me, my husband, sister-in-law and her husband had a long and tearful conversation about it where they gave us their blessings. However, a couple of weeks later,  I hear that she has been telling her mother and father that I'm being very selfish and inconsiderate, and that she could believe I was doing this to her. When I confronted her with this, she told me that of course no one would be okay with such a thing and that she hopes I lose my child and see how that feels.

&#x200B;

And let us just say it escalated to a lot of screaming from both of us. I'm considering just sticking to the name, because the whole thing has left me exhausted and is not the first time she has done something like this. But then again she is grieving woman and this is a difficult matter,

607,ESH,AITA for telling a woman I don’t care she has breast cancer?,"Some background: I work in a very tiny chain retail that sells bras and underwear. We barely have business, maybe 2-4 customers every hour, so we try to help people are much as possible since we’re able to. 

This story happened literally 20 minutes ago. 

Lady walks in, I’ll call her “CL” for “Crazy Lady” for short, and immediately comes up to me as my manager is on break. 

“I need help, now,” CL says. 

“Absolutely,” I say back. “What are you looking for?”

“I have breast cancer, and I’m starting radiation soon, so I need a comfortable, supportive bra to wear that won’t irritate me.”

I walk her over to the bras that I show every woman in the same situation. She hates those. I show her another section, she hates those. I try to ask what in particular she hates about each bra, and she doesn’t have an answer and insists I show her more. 

So I continue to point out different bras, offering various reasons why that one would work. 

Eventually she goes, “this is fucking ridiculous. You clearly don’t know your shit. Bring your other coworker out because you obviously don’t know shit. No wonder you work retail.”

I immediately started laughing, but blurt out “Excuse me?” in between giggles. 

She then gets angry and says “oh, so now you’re laughing at me because I have breast cancer? Real nice.”

At this point, my manager comes out and CL proceeds to say how I refuse to help that customer and I laughed in her face and that I made fun of her for having breast cancer. CL then makes the difficult decision to tell the manager I should be fired, oh so sad. And, of course, she wants a discount. 

My manager, not wanting a scene, goes to the back to grab a 10% coupon code just to appease the situation. 

In the meantime, CL looks at me all smug and goes, “I really hope you can survive in this world without asking $10/hour.”

So, here’s where I may have been TA. 

I go... “You really think I give a fuck about this job? I work here once a week on the weekend to help my manager while I have my full-time Monday-Friday job. Working here to help ape-shits like you who have no respect for others is the least of my worries. Have breast cancer all you want, you’re going to die a stuck up bitch one way or the other if you keep treating people like this.”

CL instantly starts crying and runs out of the store after telling me she’s calling corporate. 

My manager walks out, asks where CL went, and I tell her everything. She knows I work to help her out and that I give no shits about the store, so she understands, but then says I was way too harsh on her and will have to look into this now.

608,ESH,AITA for digging up my grandfather's grave and dragging his body across the country?,"My grandfather served on the USS Lexington and he made it very very clear that he wanted his remains to be buried with the ship.  Everyone knew this and the family decided to make this about them and bury him and have some bullshit funeral service with a bunch of shit he told them not to do. He specifically said to just cremate him and dump his ashes near the USS Lexington. Incase you aren't familiar, this ship has probably seen the most action of any ship in the US navy being involved in most of the major pacific naval battles. Having lost many friends there and working on the ship for over a decade he obviously has a deep attachment to it.

Well after he died, I tried arguing with everyone about it but it didn't matter, her kids (my aunts and uncles, mom and grandma died so they didn't have any say) decided to throw this large funeral and make it really more about them. I told them they're all selfish pieces of shit for not respecting his wishes. They didn't really care.

A week after the funeral my dad, brother, and cousins dug up his body and got it cremated. We then drove like 10 hours to Corpus Christi, Texas where the USS Lexington is and we scattered his ashes around it, walking around it on the pier scattering it from one end to the other.

I'm not sure how my family found out, but they did and they are fucking pissed. They are threatening legal action against and are starting a shit ton of drama over this saying we are disrespectful. I told them they're all pieces of shit and they should rot in hell for not respecting our grandfahter's wishes on how to be burried and they're all selfish cunts. Thanksgiving is likely going to be a lot smaller, and my aunt is threatening divorcing her husband Dale over this as he helped us. I told my aunt Sally she's a fucking cunt and selfish sack of lard. She told me she just gave away my christmas present to charity. Half the family hates the other half now

609,ESH,AITA because my daughter started a fire?,"Three weeks ago my (25F) 2.5 year old daughter and I were at my friend Ray’s (23F) house. Ray lives with her sister (30F) who wasn’t home at the time. Before moving from the living room to the kitchen, Ray lit a scented candle within reach of my daughter, who was watching TV there. I advised her against this but she brushed it off. Five minutes later, my daughter began calling for me. We rushed back to the living room to see a small fire had started on the table, which we put out immediately. My daughter had burned a halloween decoration on the candle which caused it. She was fine, but it left a small mark of about an inch on the wooden table. Ray was freaking out because it was her neat freak sister’s table, and I both apologized profusely and offered to buy her a decoration piece to cover the mark. After coming home, I texted another apology and even offered to replace the entire table. She declined both times and insisted her sister would ‘get over it’.
Since then, Ray has brought it up in multiple conversations, jokingly calling my daughter an arsonist and an ‘evil child’ on various occasions. She also makes sure to let me know about every time her sister gets angry at her for the mark on the table, which I DID offer to replace. Today she called and told me how her sister yelled at her again, saying to control her guests and that my daughter and I aren’t allowed back. I’m not sure how many more times I can keep apologizing, and how much longer I can keep hearing about the damn table, but the fact that she won’t let it go makes me wonder if I’m in the wrong here. AITA?

EDIT: Thank you for all your replies so far. I am completely aware that it was highly irresponsible of me to leave my daughter alone in that room, and I’m so grateful she wasn’t hurt. As a first-time parent I’ve learnt from this experience. 
As for the table, I’ve decided to contact the sister directly and just tell her that I’m replacing it instead of offering to. I appreciate everyone’s help!",2020-11-21 11:14:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jy94k4/aita_because_my_daughter_started_a_fire/,101,568,0.93,0

To put it in simple terms I(34m) cheated on my ex-wife(35f) with her best friend/my current wife(33f) and divorced her 5 years ago when the affair was caught, asshole move I know, but what's done, is done. This situation happened four days ago, I had just finished drinking tea with my son(6m) and sent him to his room for bed, now my current wife has an obsession with making fun of my ex's current life situation(it isn't the best) and whenever me, her and her parents have tea/any food together she shows use her Social Media, highlighting how her life has gotten worse and so on. So my in-laws were over and we were having some dessert together and my wife did it again, and she and my in-laws got some laughs making fun of the ""whore"". I might not be the best man in the world but I had to put my foot down on this one, I told them bullying someone based on their Social Media can only be so ""funny"", now it's just petty and annoying. My wife burst into tears(she's currently 6.5 months pregnant) and my father-in-law berated me for a good ten minutes saying how dare I take the side of the ""whore""(my ex).

All my other in-laws said I acted like an ass, in my opinion I was just speaking my mind, AITA? need an outside view of the situation

She’s now in her first serious relationship, and has been with her boyfriend (21M) for 3 months. I asked her if they were sexually active and she said yes, but he doesn’t know about her herpes. 

She said that since she’s on suppressant medication that he’d never know, and it’s very unlikely he’d get it too. However, it is still possible to give it to someone even on suppressants. I told her she needs to tell him as soon as possible so he doesn’t give it to anyone else. She said that she’d only do that if they break up and was very upset that I was pressuring her. 

I went behind her back and told her boyfriend over facebook.

612,ESH,AITA for telling my friend that it's not my fault that nobody loved her (dead) parents or her enough to take her in?,"I (16F) never knew who my father was. I was raised single handedly by my mom. My mom didn't have any siblings but she had a lot of very good friends who were always around while I was growing up. I consider all of them family. 

One particular couple, Susan and Tom (I call them aunt and uncle), are very close to my family. Since my mom was estranged from her own family, she made sure that Susan and Tomorrow become my guardians in the event of her death. 

She passed away when I was 15. Soon after that, Susan and Tom took me in. Things were hard at first (I was grieving, they had kids too) but we all made it. One of the things that helped the most was support groups. 

I met my friend, Kate (16F), at this support group. She also lost her parents 3 years ago. Her parents wanted her father's brother and wife to be her guardian upon their death but apparently they refused to take her in. Their grandparents were in retirement homes and no adult (friend or family) helped her. She also told me she thinks that her uncle stole a lot of her money that she is supposed to receive when she turns 18.

Kate had to go into the foster system and she ended up in a group home. Her foster parents aren't evil but they do the bare minimum to pass the inspection. Some of the older kids in the home aren't really nice. After few fights, the therapy and support group was mandated for her. 

We have only spoken over the phone as everything was online. We really bonded, but we weren't able to meet until restrictions were lifted. I have spoken about my family but I don't think I mentioned that fact that they weren't related to me. 

My Aunt suggested that I invite her to visit and I did. She visited one Sunday. Things were fine at first but I could tell that something was annoying her. She was becoming increasingly snappy as the day progressed. 

We were having dinner and we were all talking and then she suddenly exploded. She slammed her hands down the table and told us all to shut the fuck up and started screaming at us. 

She said that they weren't my real Aunt/Uncle and that weren't a real family, so we should all stop pretending to be one. She said that having pictures in the living room, having dinner together was just trying too hard. She said that her parents had family while my mother didn't even know who fathered me. She said that this is the life she should be having and I should have been the one in the group home. 

I got pissed off and told her that she was just jealous. I told her that my family may not be ""real"" but at least they love me. I also said that it wasn't my fault that her parents didn't have anyone who loved/cared about them/her enough to help her or take her in. 

She stormed out after that and I immediately blocked her everywhere as I didn't want to talk to her again. 

My Aunt thinks that what I did was right (edit: feeling like I was intruding or imposing on them was a very real fear of mine and something I have confided to Kate.) My Aunt feels I snapped and defended myself because it's a touchy subject for me but my Uncle thinks that I was too harsh. 

I just wanted to ask opinions. Even if you disagree with what I have done, I kindly request you to not be rude.

She has also victimized herself and blames my dad for everything that went wrong in their relationship. In reality my mum was a very controlling person, she consistently started petty fights with my dad and she was pretty abusive towards him. (I don't think I can go into the details on this sub) So today I snapped and told her that the reason she got cheated on is because she treated my dad like shit. 

We got into a big fight and my mum called me a traitor and kicked me out so now I'm staying with my dad who has thanked me for defending him.

614,ESH,AITA for being offended I was asked for a favor while I’m on chemo?,"I (41f) was diagnosed with breast cancer back in June. Devastating for the whole family including my hubby (46m) and my kids (13f and 15m). I am going through chemo and it is awful, but I try to put on a brave face and keep things as normal as possible for my family. Rarely let them see how sick and tired I feel. I save my ugly crying for when I’m alone in the shower. When anyone calls and asks how I am I give the standard “I’m fine! Don’t worry! Chemo isn’t so bad! I can do a lot of things myself! I don’t need anything!” I hate asking anyone for anything. I’m trying to maintain my independence as much as possible. Not so for my mother n law. So when she had a party (which we would not attend due to the current situation and my immunocompromised health) she asked me to contribute by making my specialty dish. I flipped out! Who asks a sick person for a favor? Even though I say I’m ok, it’s because I don’t want anyone to worry. But doesn’t everyone know without being told how awful chemo is? Isn’t it common sense? Whatever little energy I have is reserved for my kids, not catering a dish for a party. I saw this as just another selfish request from mil. Hubby of course doesn’t see anything wrong. We’ve been arguing about it. He says I cook and bake at home and for my family, and he is tired of me bringing it up and dwelling on it. I say he is so easily manipulated by his mummy. He has such a blind spot when it comes to his family. If I say anything about his family he takes it as a personal insult. I say his family is my family and I’m allowed to call out when something is wrong as many times as I want. I can’t believe he’s defending her on this when my days could be literally numbered. So, AITA?

More info: sorry left out the request was made to my husband who relayed it to me. I’m not really upset with mil. Moreso hubby who said “so what? big deal you cook for your family” when I wanted/needed him to say “ya that’s kinda out of line for her to ask” and shut her down when she asked him. He knows very well living with me that I’m not well. He’s the one I’m mad at. Mil doesn’t even check in on me that often- she’s called me once a month maybe. I haven’t said one rude word to her.

Edit #2: Thanks everyone for the responses. Quite a variety of responses and no clear consensus so this is all clear as mud in my mind!

I learned I need to be more honest with how I’m feeling. I really will try. Honestly it’s bc I don’t want to alarm my kids. For everyone else, I just can’t stand the pity. I don’t have the energy to console anybody else. Some of you will know what I mean. It’s easier to just say “I’m fine” it’s how I cope. I’m not a complainer and those who really get me are still incredibly supportive. Just knowing I have cancer and I’m in active treatment is enough for literally everyone else in my life to ask what they can do for me, not what I can do for them. 

Thanks everyone who wished me well. The kindness of internet strangers really moved me. To those who really believe I’m the AH, thanks I will try to be more honest with how I’m feeling. But would you really ask your sick friends to cook for you? Seriously?

My mil is self absorbed and always needs a favor. She has a history of making unreasonable requests with wide eyed innocence and dumbass hubby falls for it every time. I’m not so easily manipulated though. So, no, this was not her being kind to include me. 

I get I maybe overreacted but I’m dealing with a lot- all my long term plans have gone up in smoke. I lost my breasts, my hair, my nails, my looks, my stamina, my strength, my financial security.  There is not one part of my life, not one cell in my body that cancer has not touched. I will never have piece of mind again. This monster will chase me for the rest of my days. I live in constant fear my children will be dealing with lifelong grief and the emotional scars that will leave. I have nightmares of my babies saying goodbye to my emaciated body on my deathbed. So, no mother dearest, I can’t make mushroom risotto. Dumbass hubby has firsthand witnessed to my mental and physical struggles, and he has been incredibly supportive except for with his mum. It’s so weird he’s super defensive of her. It’s a total blind spot in his judgement.",2020-10-24 20:24:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jhg0fg/aita_for_being_offended_i_was_asked_for_a_favor/,331,1760,0.93,0

There’s nothing wrong with him, I just don’t need a dad or another parent. My biological dad was an alcoholic asshole. He cheated on and emotionally abused my mom for 15 years. She finally left him when I was 6 and my little sister was 3. Since then I’ve relied on my uncle, my dads brother. He’s been a mentor and a father figure to me since my mom got rid of my dad.

My step dad tries to be a father to me and my sister. My sister really loves him and calls him dad and everything, which is cool for her, but he’s not my dad. He will never be and I’ll never call him my father.

He tries to weasel his way into my life and act like he knows what’s best for me. I recently got cheated on by and had to break up with my girlfriend. It’s been pretty hard. I’ve been talking to my mom and uncle about it since it happened, but 3 days ago my mom refused to talk to me about it. She told me that she’s not going to be able to relate as well as my stepdad would so it’d be good for me to talk to him. I told her I wouldn’t.

I then called my uncle and he told me the same bullshit. He said that he thinks it’d be a good idea to talk to my stepdad and that he’s been in my life for 9 years so I should give him a chance. I hung up. Eventually my stepdad came up to my room and asked if I wanted to talk about it. I got suspicious and asked him if he had spoke to my mom or uncle. He caved immediately and said he asked them to direct me towards him because he really wants to help.

I told him roughly this. “You need to stay the fuck out of my life. You’re not my fucking dad, so stop trying to be. I don’t want your advice or your help or anything. If you want to pretend to be a father go talk to Ash(my sister). I don’t want shit from you.”

He apologized for everything he did and left. 2 hours later my mom came to my room and went off. She told me my stepdad was downstairs crying about what I said. She said that I should be ashamed of myself and that I’m a ungrateful brat and need to learn respect and apologize to her husband. I refused. She then grounded me until I apologized. I still haven’t. Even my uncle thinks I should apologize.

616,ESH,AITA for causing a scene when my hairstylist majorly messed up my hair?,"I know this may sound petty since its just hair and it'll fix itself in like a week, but i was really peeved and my friend is calling me an asshole so i need unbiased opinions.

earlier this week, i went to a hair salon close to my house, it was one of those franchised hair salons that have multiple locations around my city. i usually keep it pretty simple, short on the side, long on the top, like a pseudo undercut but without the fade.

as i was getting my haircut, my stylist was talking to another stylist and not really focusing on what she should be doing, which at that point, cutting my hair. she kept looking away to gossip to her co-worker. well at one point when she was trimming my sideburns, she looks away again to talk to her co-worker, and ended up buzzing off a clean line from my forehead to just about past my ear.

and i'm not sure if you'd believe me when i say i'm normally a pretty calm and composed person, but i freaked out. probably the most I've ever freaked out on another person, and my last girlfriend cheated on me, and i wasn't as angry as i was at that moment. 

I hopped out of the chair and this is from the best of my memory but i said:
""what the fuck are you doing!? why the fuck are you talking to your co-worker when you should be paying attention?! look what you did! how can someone mess up this bad?!? what the fuck is wrong with you??? are you freaking new or some shit? did you just recently graduation hair cut school?? (not sure what its called)""

she started apologizing and tried to get me to sit back down saying she can fix it, but i didn't trust her anymore, and i demanded someone else take her place and i quote ""i need someone who actually knows how to cut hair, i'm not sitting back down and have your incompetent ass continue to cut my hair! do you think i'm daft or some shit???"" she just hung her head down and looked like she was about to cry, and admittedly i wanted to cry too. luckily another stylist just finished her client and so she finished up the job, not like there was any way to fix it, so she buzzed the rest of my sides and back down and to match the length of the mistake (ie, removed the hair since trimming settings on the clippers take it down to nothing) now i look like a freaking paintbrush.

after everything was all said and done, they comped my haircut, but i still tossed a few bucks to the stylist that attempted to fix it. and i asked for the contact information for the manager and i was on my way.

i contacted the number later, and they told me they were already aware of what happened and it's being investigated.

now what brings me to why i made this post, i was telling my friend about what happened and he thinks i was a major asshole, and i didn't need to freak out that bad. and that ""you probably costed that woman her job, over hair that'll grow back!"" yes, i know it'll grow back, but it's called doing your job, and not being distracted while cutting someones hair jfc.

People decided now that what Dominos did was unacceptable and are boycotting them. My MIL is one of those dumbass motherfuckers and when she was over at my place she got really triggered when I said I ordered us some dominos pizza, around 6 other people were at my house. She explained why and I laughed my ass off thinking it was a joke later realizing it was serious. She demanded I order other food for her because she won’t eat dominos. I told her no and to piss of, she wanted to eat my leftovers and I said no, I’m eating them for breakfast tomorrow.

She is pissed because i won’t give her other food options and she refuses to order her own food. She eventually left and is pissed at me because her husband didn’t want to take part in this insanity and stayed over. My wife is pissed because she said i brought on an unnecessary conflict, but i say tfuck that because this is so ridiculous, there was nothing political and it happened in 2012 for fucks sake. These people are a bunch of fuckign idiots holy shit. My wife wants me to apologize to my MIL and i told her i won’t because this is fucking stupid. MIL refuses to see me until i do and I see that as a win win.

618,ESH,"AITA for getting my girlfriend a birthday cake, but not the way she wanted?","TL;DR  girlfriend is upset that her birthday celebration wasn't as she expected, despite the fact that it went well and I made it clear weeks before that it was a casual affair.

I  (25M) met my girlfriend (24F when we were in college, let's call her  Liz. We're both in different cities.

During our college years, I would throw her birthday parties with a few friends. They were fairly simple, nothing too fancy, but Liz is very appreciative even of small gestures. This side of her has always had a special place in my heart.

Liz's birthday was a week ago, but I couldn't make it because I was attending in-person classes in another city. I  told her that I would come this week to see her and we would have a  little dinner and a small cake to celebrate. Liz was a bit upset that it wasn't on her actual birth date but she was excited nonetheless. My classes were hectic and I spent most waking hours studying and Liz has been very supportive.

I  kept telling Liz that it was going to be a casual affair, and Liz was excited. I didn't have time nor money (college amirite?) to make reservations, I didn't know the city that well, so I found this nice restaurant. I didn't check if they did birthday stuff, so I had the back-up plan of taking her elsewhere for cake. To be fair, I didn't tell her that the restaurant may not do birthdays, and my plan wasn't exactly air-tight either.

We met up for dinner. She was dressed really nicely and I was dressed casually. The waiter said that the place didn't do birthday parties.

Liz's expression turned from excitement to anger. I was also a bit disappointed, but I had a backup. Liz said, ""you promised me there was going to be cake"". 

I  apologized and told her that she knew how hectic it's been for me and that I had a backup. Liz gave me the silent treatment, and I felt that she was being unreasonable, but I wasn't going to let anything ruin her birthday.

I tried to find a more immediate solution. The waiter told me I could bring a cake to the restaurant.

I returned to Liz and told her that I solved the issue, her eyes lit up and she was happy for the rest of the night.

She video-called me later that night and talked about what had happened, how she got upset because she had high expectations, how she made efforts to dress up and look good, how I  didn't deliver on my promise, how I always do something special, and that this birthday was tainted by my screw-up.

Ngl, I cried because I had never in my life seen her act that way, and it was like emotional whiplash. I told her that things didn't go exactly as planned but the evening turned out to be amazing.

I  told her I didn't get where all this aggressive behavior was coming from. Yes, there were hiccups, but we managed to do everything that I  said we were going to do. Liz kept reiterating her previous points until I just lost my shit and started yelling at the top of my lungs, telling her that I felt hurt. I hung up the phone and left it at that.

619,ESH,AITA for mocking my brother for getting rejected by his dream college (that I got into) because he keeps tormenting me over it?,"
My brother Jake (18M) and I (17F) had the same dream college, H University. Also, in case you’re confused by the ages, we’re 1.5 years apart, but I skipped a grade so we were in the same grade for nearly our entire life. Jake was way more passionate about H Uni than I was. He had several H merch clothing, and kind of just assumed he was going there. For example, in conversations he’d say things like “Once I’m at H....” or “After I go to H, my plan is...”. Basically, his life plan rested on him going to H. 

Jake and I got along pretty well, we’d sometimes give each other advice or study together. However, during college app season, he got super competitive once he realized I was also applying to H. He’d refuse to study together, look over each other’s essays, and he’d constantly tell me to not even bother applying. 

Then, decisions came out and we opened them at the same time. I was accepted, and he was rejected. Jake had a massive panic attack, and instead of celebrating my acceptance with my family, I sat in my room all day because Jake would get furious when he saw me. 

I once even caught him trying to unlock my laptop to decline my offer, since his friend dmed me to warn that he had been talking about doing that. My parents obviously punished him for that, which made it so much worse. When my H sweatshirt came in, he screamed at me for “showing off”, when I just put it in my closet. He told so many people that I only got in because I was a girl and that H mixed the siblings up. 

Honestly, I felt bad for him because I would be crushed too if I were him. Everytime I tried to get him to stop, it got worse.  So I just kept tolerating it. I thought it’d get better after the summer, once college actually started. 

It has not. Now it’s really set in that he is going to a (good imo) state school, and not H. His anger is largely compounded by the fact that he’s going to the same college that he used to condescend other students about aiming for. 

My classes start soon, so I’ve been setting up in our study, which I share with Jake. Both of our rooms are tiny, with no room to study in, so we share a study with two desks that face away from each other. Jake cleared out my whole desk, and broke my lamp in the process. He says that I need to study in my room, so he can use the study without distractions for his classes. We’ve always both worn headphones, there’s literally no distraction. He just doesn’t want to see me taking classes at H. 

I’m so fucking done, I just want to be proud that I got into this college and actually learn shit without my brother screaming at me about it. 

Where IMBTA: We got into an argument, and  I told him that of course he got rejected since H didn’t take toddlers. I’ve also been wearing my H sweatshirt around the house constantly, which he gets angry about. He kept bothering me, so I superglued H rejection letters in the drawers of his desk, so he has to see them when he opens them.",2020-08-30 13:00:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ijcb69/aita_for_mocking_my_brother_for_getting_rejected/,2038,25583,0.96,25
620,ESH,AITA for not letting my ex know that he does indeed have a child despite what the paternity test said?,"So, I was in a relationship with ""Matthew"" for 1 1/2 years. Or at least I sure thought I was in a relationship; he said we were never in a relationship.  We went out on dates, I met his family, after four months of dating we were having sex, spent loads of time together doing a variety of activities- you know, a relationship.  

I got pregnant. He was not happy. I told him to be diligent about using condoms. A few times right after I had finished my period, he didn't want to use a condom but made sure he used them when I was ovulating. That's on him.  He asked me to abort. I said no, but that I'd release him from responsibility if he wanted to not have part of the kid's life.  I thought that was more than fair.  But he said he'd coparent and still *kinda* wanted to be in a relationship with me. I think I was very kind and patient with him having mixed feelings.  

Towards the end of the pregnancy, he said he didn't want to be present for the labor and, frankly, I was relieved, but I would've let him be there if he wanted to. So, get this, I go into labor and he chose that time to say he doesn't think it's his baby. He's going to want a paternity test.  I said no problem, we'll definitely get the paternity test and then made him leave the premises while I was waiting for my best friend to drive me to the birthing center.

I most definitely did not have sex with any other man in the entire time we were together.  So......the paternity test said.....No, it wasn't his baby. I swore to God it was a mistake and we needed to do a second one to clarify. I also feel like he should've been emotionally intelligent enough to tell that I was deeply committed and in love with him and that I didn't cheat on him.    

But that was it. He broke it off with me, never to speak to me again. I moved home to Minnesota to have the support of my family. My brother is doing a wonderful job of being a paternal figure to his nephew. But here's the deal. The now three-year-old is a dead ringer for him. He even has deep red hair like him and unique green eyes and that aquiline profile.  There's no doubt. Mistakes are made and that lab most definitely screwed something up.  He looks almost like a twin to a cousin he has (I spied on that family on Facebook). I keep his pics set to private in case he or his sisters ever check me up. 

Edited to say: the rules say I'm supposed to be clear on why I might be the asshole.  I've deprived this man of knowing that he has a son and deprived them of having a potential relationship, at least for this phase of life.  I've also deprived myself of child support by doing this.   

Edited again to say:  Don't know if child support is enough to disrupt the child's life and having to ship a kid from the Mid West to the west coast on a regular basis.

621,ESH,AITA for telling a kid why she got her name?,"Throwaway. On mobile. Dyslexic. 
posting since a similar post showed up/ exactly how we felt when it happened. 

When my daughter was 9 she was riding in the car with my MIL and they got hit by a truck and passed away. I was a wreck, my wife was a wreck and we are still actively grieving the loss of our baby Katie to this day. When it happened my SIL said that it was our fault for not giving her our child when she was born. 
She didn’t attend my child’s funeral. 


A year later SIL announced she was naming her baby Katie after our baby so there could still be a living katie in the family. My wife flipped and begged her not to. SIL accused us of being selfish and said we where just jealous she could finally raise Katie like she deserved without us getting in her way. Most of the inlaws stopped speaking to SIL since her announcement.  


Her child is now 10 and we’ve have not spoken to SIL since. Shes blocked in every way we can. Last year my wife decided to make amends with her dad and we’ve slowly begun letting FIL back in. Last month we lent him a spare garden hose and he dropped by to return it, he brought SIL’s kid over since he was baby sitting and tried to introduce us thinking we’d forgive SIL. When I got home from work FIL was in the kitchen with my wife while the kid wandered the house. We still have some of Katie’s things up, including her soccer trophy with her name on it. She asked about Katie. I sat her down and told the kid about the tournament and finished by telling her she is only named Katie because our daughter passed away and her mother named her that to spite my wife. SIL’s kid looked at me funny then nodded and left with FIL when my wife was done talking to him. 



Yesterday FIL called us and started screaming how his granddaughter wants to change her name because she thinks it was stolen and now SIL is angry and her new husband thinks shes a monster and hasn’t come home since the kid told him about the visit. My wife said that karma finally caught SIL and how shocking it was that the kid had a decent bone in her body after being raised by SIL and a few other choice words about how he always favored SIL over her even while SIL made our grief all about her and stole our baby. By the end of it all my wife was sobbing. 


I might be the Ahole because he never would have called if I lied to the kid or threw them out, on the other hand she asked and FIL brought the kid over knowing we never wanted to even see its face or SIL again after everything that witch did to my wife.",2020-10-30 01:02:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jkn1wf/aita_for_telling_a_kid_why_she_got_her_name/,217,1113,0.96,0
622,ESH,AITA for ungrounding my daughter after my husband grounded her because his reason for grounding her was stupid?,"My husband in 2019 lost his job of 10 years and had to take up very low paying ones.

My daughter (15) has been doing commercials, modeling, and acting jobs since she was 6.

Since 2020, my husband’s income has been cut even more. I don’t work and have never worked. As such, most of the money we use has come from my daughter, who says she wants to use her nest egg to help us out with stuff like rent for the house we live in right now, utilities, and bought me a really nice tote for my birthday. 

My daughter has worked non stop for nearly ten years and now she wants to have some fun with her friends. However, my husband decides to get strict and tell her that her curfew is 11pm.  

She decides on Monday to go out with friends from the neighborhood. My husband texts her at 11:05 and says if she’s not home in 15 minutes they were going to have a problem because she didn’t call ahead.

She sends back“ I’ll be home when the Uber I decide to call pulls up to the damm driveway. Don’t forget to turn off the lights I pay for.“ 

She gets home at 12:30 and my husband is mad at her snark and her rule breaking and grounds her for three days.

Tuesday morning he goes away to see his mom with cancer. He calls later saying that he’s going to be gone for a couple of days because she’s in bad shape. Tuesday afternoon, I tell my daughter that I’m ungrounding her and that her dad was wrong to ground her. And that we cannot begin to repay her for her support. 

I feel like my husband’s curfew is stupid because she’s homeschooled and doesn’t need to wake up early. 

Second, my husband tries to treat her like a child, yet apparently thinks she’s adult enough to pay nearly all our bills. 

I think it’s hypocritical and that the “my house my rules” is being abused because our daughter is the one paying for most of our expenses from her own money.

AITA? I feel like my husband is robbing our daughter of her agency and this is a shitty way of repaying her for her supporting us until he finds better work. 
 
My husband found out she was at a house party through Instagram and is texting me angry messages but I texted back that he had no right to ground her in the first place.",2020-09-24 23:18:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/iz8703/aita_for_ungrounding_my_daughter_after_my_husband/,1182,3081,0.91,1
623,ESH,AITA for calling my cousin a ‘wannabe edgy failure’?,"My parents and their siblings immigrated here from India and are fairly stereotypical Indian parents with high expectations.

My cousin didn’t meet said expectations. She nearly failed out of high school and now at 20 is going to community college. I don’t think going to community college is inherently a bad thing— if you don’t have money or do have it and just want to save it, or if you need to stay close to home, it’s a great option. However, if you literally almost fail out of high school and have to go to cc because nobody else will accept you, that’s another matter. So what I’m saying is, I don’t look down on community colleges, I just think it’s bad she almost failed out of high school. *High school.*

Anyhow, over the weekend I received a likely letter (basically a guarantee that you’re going to be admitted to a college before acceptances are officially send out) from NYU Stern, my dream school. We had a family zoom session to ‘celebrate’ (I personally don’t like being paraded around for their clout, but if it makes them happy, I’m cool with that). 

My cousin was making a lot of stand-offish comments. I recognized she was jealous because when we were young she always wanted to get into a prestigious college and have people praise her. And she didn’t get that, and I am. 

Anyhow, it was annoying how she kept derailing everything with her petty comments, so I told her if she had something to say, she should just say it. She said I was a ‘clone with no personality’ and a ‘lack of original thought’. Basically she was saying I couldn’t think for myself and was just a sheep following indian parents’s expectations. 

This annoyed me, so I just pointed out that it was funny she *wanted* to be where I was today, with good grades and an acceptance to a good college. She just couldn’t get in. So she wanted to be ‘a sheep’, she just failed, and if being a sheep is so bad, how bad must one be to fail at that? I finished off with saying she was trying to be edgy and alternative and ‘woke’ but was just doing that to mask the fact she failed. 

This caused her to start crying and storm off (she couldn’t leave the zoom because her parents were on it with her). My parents think I was too harsh, but her parents think she started it.

624,ESH,AITA for filing charges against my roommate and suing her for my hospital bill?,"This happened several years ago. 

I was a 20F and in college. I was living with my two best friends. One of them was moving out so that she could move in with her boyfriend. I placed an ad looking for another roommate. 

That's how I met Erin. Before she moved in she informed me that she was vegetarian but she wouldn't have a problem if other roommates weren't. She moved into our apartment a month later. 

The next day after she moved in she cooked breakfast for us. I was surprised. We didn't ask her to and by her own words ""she wanted to do something nice"". 

She had made pancakes, bacon strips and hash browns. I am deathly allergic to few things. 

So, I immediately asked her what was in the food, but I didn't mention my allergies (huge mistake). She listed the ingredients and I didn't find anything I was allergic to. [Edit: she told me it was regular bacon. Not that it was fake bacon or that it had soy]. I start eating and everything tastes a little off. I try the bacon and definitely something is wrong. At this point, she does a "" Ta da"" and smugly  told us ""I bet it tastes exactly like meat"".

I am freaking out now. I told her I am severely allergic to soy and asked her whether there was any soy. Now she is apologising and says she didn't know and that she is sorry she lied and blah blah. I am experiencing anaphylactic shock: throat closing up, dizzy, the works. My bestfriend freaks out and calls an ambulance. I had to stay in the hospital for 2 days. With the US healthcare, the ambulance + my hospital stay racked up a lot of money. Money that I didn't have. 

In the meantime, I also filed a complaint with the police. Food tampering is a felony. I had a lucky break: my best friend had filmed the breakfast to post it on Instagram and she got the whole thing in video. 

In the end Erin had to plead guilty to some low degree of felony. She didn't get any jail time, but got community service. Once she was found guilty, I sued her for the hospital fees. I won that one too. 

[I did all the legal things under the advise of my Uncle's friend who is a lawyer. He said something about how it will be easy to sue if she had a guilty charge. I also did not have any contact with Erin during any of this under the advise of my laywer].

Erin's scholarship was cancelled and she had to drop out. She also went into dent paying medical fees. I saw her on Facebook few days ago and she is still down on her luck. I guess a felony charge makes it very hard, no matter how small the charge was. 

I know she is the asshole for lying about food. I wanna know whether I am the asshole for everything I did after. Because bottom line is, I basically screwed a person's life because they put wrong ingredients on breakfast that they made only ""to do something nice"".

Edit: You guys are bitching like as if I wrote the law on food tampering or like I was the PP who decided what charges to file or like as I if I was the judge/jury that gave the verdict. This is a snorefest. Throwing the throwaway account.

625,ESH,AITA for taking the rest of my family on vacations without my oldest son because my ex never gave him permission to travel?,"My parenting agreement included the words, ""Both parents must give permission to take the child out of state or out of the country"".

The first few years after my divorce, I had no issues taking my son with me on trips. But once I married my wife, my ex became extremely hostile and denied every single request to take my son out of state, let alone out of the country.

We initially tried to make do by taking local trips but my wife and I felt it was very unfair to my stepdaughter and our two younger children to miss out on these experiences.

So from the time my son was 12-18, we went on four big trips that were out of the country. And every time, I planned the trips on my custody days, and requested official permission from my ex which she always denied. And as much as I hated it, we went on the trips anyway.

I went back to court three separate times over the years to fix the wording in the agreement which I always lost.

At the guidance of our family therapist, I was always upfront with my son about why he wasn't able to come on the trips. And I also made sure I saved proof of my ex denying permission. He was upset but at the time, directed his anger at my ex and seemed to be understanding towards me.

But when my son turned 18, it all blew up in my face. He started attacking me for going on the trips. I tried to compromise by paying airfare for him to go to the same locations we went to. But that wasn't enough and I've since paid all his costs to go to New York City and Hawaii to try and fix our relationship.

But after every trip, he just comes back angrier because he wants the entire family to go with him.

My wife stopped working a year ago due to some issues. There is no way I can afford what he's asking.

I had to be firm and I told him he can accept my offer of paying for his trips, which are not cheap in the slightest, or not get anything at all.

And I told him he had to wait for the next two trips because money is very tight.

He did not take it well and now has involved my ex, her parents, my parents and it's a whole mess.

I was extremely grateful for the clothes but soon enough the night turned into a fucking disaster, to say the least.

So, as I said, we arent close. With that said, I had no idea she was vegetarian. Not once was this mentioned in our phone call about dinner either. I made basic hamburgers and hotdogs on the grill because it was the absolute easiest meal to cook in large portions (I have a family of 5; she has a family of 4). She didnt even say anything while I was cooking.

Well, I put the dinner on the table and call everyone to their seats. Now, her two kids are eyeballing the food. They both want a cheeseburger. Aunt goes fucking ballistic and says she brought her own food because her, her husband and her two kids are on a strict vegetarian diet. She pulls out tofu. Her kids immediately sulk. It was none of my business though so I kept my mouth shut.

Well, until she started talking about meat, how its made/processed, where it comes from, etc. All while we are trying to eat. She then goes on to talk about the bacteria in meat and how it ""kills you"". So, my husband and oldest child refuse to touch their food at this point. Not because they dont want it because my aunt is losing her mind and being ignorant. So, I looked at her and said ""Hey, how about we shut the fuck up. You're vegetarian. We are not. Not only that but you're in my home and I wont let my family feel walked on.""

She packed her kids and left. Her husband is apologizing. Says he wishes he got to try some of the burgers I made, etc. I then start getting texts from my aunt stating that I disrespected her and embarrassed her after she did such a generous thing for me and that she wont be helping me out ever again.

However, this had lead to a lot of people asking whether I need support, or should contact the state for help given to disabled people etc. services and support I by no means need.   


A week or so ago a friend of mine (M30), who have another more severe problem, asked whether I've considered one of these types of state support. I got quite mad, and answered that ""I've got not intention of using services for handicapped people, and I get quite mad when you ask about that."" He answered that he had, and wanted my oppinion. Notice that he asked if I needed it, not stating that he considered it. Further, such a reaction apparently made med ableist, and showed how I looked upon those who need it. Just so that it said, I by no means look down upon those who do need it, and have worked for groups attempting to strengthen these services. I just find offending that one should out of the blue ask if I'm considering without me ever having talked about, or in any way shown a need for it.   


So, am I the asshole?",2020-11-19 10:57:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jx0pkp/aita_saying_i_dont_want_services_for_disabled/,76,332,0.93,1
630,ESH,AITA for encouraging my brother to get a DNA test for his baby?,"I did it because he and his wife were on a long break when the child was conceived. I knew from what he told me that they had agreed it was okay for each to see other people, but he never told me if she did just that she claimed the baby was his. 

I don't think his wife is a liar, but I told him he should confirm for himself so he had no doubts going forward. For all he knew she could have been mistaken about dates or conception if she had any other partners. Really they both needed to know for certain. 

He was supposed to do it in private without involving his wife, which he did, but he started to feel guilty for doubting her once the results came back and confessed to having the test done and that it was my idea. 

My brother and his wife have now split again, and the entire family blames me, even my brother. They all say that I shouldn't have interfered or encouraged him to do the test, but I never forced him to do it. I made the suggestion and gave my reasons why it made sense, but he was the one who decided he needed it. That aside, I don't think he did anything wrong, so the fact that she got upset is on her, not me or my brother. There was nothing crazy about him wanting to confirm paternity since they had been split for a while, weren't exactly having regular sex and could see other people. 

My wife has also said she is bothered by my actions for the same reasons but some different ones. She doesn't like the fact that I encouraged my brother not to believe his wife or me encouraging him to do it in secret. She thinks I may have some bad views about these types of situations and would hide things from her. I know what she means, but all I was doing was trying to protect my brother and his interests. 

I'm not sure if I had it to do over again if I'd made a different decision, but I am not above apologizing if I was out of line and TA.",2020-10-24 02:07:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jh0s00/aita_for_encouraging_my_brother_to_get_a_dna_test/,286,894,0.96,0
631,ESH,AITA for not telling my girlfriend I speak Russian (her native language)?,"My girlfriend is from Russia and I self taught myself russian and I later lived in Ukraine for a bit so I basically speak almost perfect Russian. 

I started dating Diana 4 weeks ago. The relationship was pretty good and I never felt the need to speak to her in russian as her English is good and I figured that if she doesbt know I know russian perhaps I can see if she's actually loyal or if she'll talk shit about me etc. 

We broke up when I found out she was  chеаting on me. I found out when she was at my place talking on the phone to a friend and she explained how she fucked another guy twice when I was gone and she was lonely and how she feels she made a mistake. I said in russian ""you're damn right you made a mistake and you can get oit of my apartment now."" 

She's completely shocked and is asking me how I k kw russian and wtf. She's cursing me out saying I'm such an asshoke for violating her privacy by not telling her I know russian and being able to understand her private conversations. 

I told her she has to leave or she'll be forcibly removed. 

I got a barrage of texts and calls from other mutual friends saying I'm such an asshoke for not telling her I speak Russian and how much personal shit I've ovrheadd.

632,ESH,AITA for telling my cousin he has no right to introduce his atheist beliefs on the children of the family?,"So I don’t think I’m the asshole, but he told me I was. For context, we’re both in our early to mid 20s when this occurred.

My cousin is a loud and proud atheist and preaches about his atheism to anyone and everyone and tries to “convert” you to it as well. I’ve told him a hundred times to stop trying to change the family cause no one wants to but he insists on debating. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve called him the “preacher of atheism” cause he won’t shut up. 

No one in our family gives a damn that he’s an atheist. We just don’t want him to influence our kids as we prefer them to be raised in Islam. He deliberately goes against the parents wishes and speaks to the kids to ask for “proof” that God exists. These are 11-17 year olds. They are very impressionable. Needless to say, their parents are pissed. 

When they confronted him, he said that the kids asked and he answered truthfully knowing full well that the parents want the kids raised in Islam and would be against this. They don’t want the kids to doubt their religion because of his influence, especially when they love him so much and look up to him. They can handle answering questions from outside influences, but they didn’t expect it to come from him. 

This is where I come in. I took him aside and told him it’s not his place to parent other people’s children. For me, if I had impressionable teens, he would never see them again and I told him I wouldn’t be surprised if the  older adults refused to let him see their kids again. He got pissed and called me a bitch for that. 

Now the older generation have cut him off and told him that while they didn’t like that he was atheist, they accepted him anyway, but he crossed a line when he made the kids doubt Islam as well. He called me and starting ranting about how they are all discriminating against him because he’s an atheist. I told him he alienated himself when he decided to push his beliefs on these children. I also told him to raise his kids how he wants, but stay away from everyone else’s unless directly invited.

633,ESH,AITA for refusing my sister ‘her’ investment,"A few years ago my sister lived way above her means and ran up huge credit cards. She had $20000 in ‘savings’ which came from our dad selling his home and giving her money but not me as he claimed I was financially stable and could wait til he died. Anyway sis gives me the money for safe keeping in case she has to file for bankruptcy (never happened). She asked me to put the money in a bank account. I did. Now I got wind of an investment opportunity and decided I wanted to invest 20 k in it. I had my own savings of 10 k and asked my sister if she wanted to put in hers. She said no way she doesn’t believe in stuff like this! So I said fine. So I put in my money and then here’s the AITA bit I ‘borrowed’ (without telling her) 10 k or hers. I then worked overtime like crazy, did freelance and paid the 10 k back into the savings account within 6 months. A year later I gave her $1000 because I felt bad about borrowing her money. I told her what I’d done and she blew up which was fair but I explained I was always going to pay back the 10 k in 6 months even if it meant selling everything. Anyway she was pissed but she got an extra 1000 so she was fine. I still have the money in my account for ‘safe keepin’ IDK why she does this but whatever. Now my investment has made a ton and I’m looking at buying a house. My sister basically started talking about what she was going to do with her half. I was like ‘what are you saying. It’s my money’ she blew up big time saying it was her investment too and I was stealing. I asked if the money had been lost would she expect me to give her 10 k back regardless and she admitted she would as she ‘didn’t ask for this’ I also pointed out I paid it back. But she says but they could be my savings and her original 10 k was invested. Makes no sense to me so I’m refusing to give her 50% and she and my mom and dad are all saying I’m the biggest ah out there and I stole my sister’s investment.

634,ESH,AITA for pissing in a trashcan in class?,"When I was in 7th grade I almost got expelled for this, i was suspended. My history teacher really really hated me, I know she had familiy members who were politicians running against my mother who was a congresswoman, which is why im sure she always treated me like shit even though I never did anything o her. 

Well one day i drank too much water and I really had to use the bathroom. I rose my hand and she said no, I again explained it was an emergency and I couldn't hold it. After 5 minutes I knew I was about to burst and I rose my hand and she yelled at me really loudly ""put your hand down now, you will not be using the bathroom"" 

I was so pissed and I just walked up to the trashcan and I pissed in it. She was furious and of course half hte class was laughing their asses off. She sent me to hte principals office and they all ended class early. The janitor cleaned up the trash. I feel bad for Mr Tran for having to do that, Mr Tran if you're reading this im sorry :(. 

My parents came and picked me up, and the principal decided to suspend me as i generally had good behavior. They also moved me to another history teacher.

636,ESH,AITA for not wanting to delay my retirement so my wife can retire sooner?,"I have been with my wife for almost 10 years, married for 5. Early on in our relationship I told her one of my goals was to retire early and devote myself to my hobbies. I had decided to do this in my 20s and adhered to the FIRE methodologies (although at the time I didn't know it was called that).

Over the years I sacrificed many things in pursuit of this goal. I minimized eating out, forwent expensive vacations, strictly budgeted my expenditures, worked long hours to get promotions and bonuses, etc.

Anyways I am coming up on 45 and by my calculations I have plenty between savings, 401k, stocks, etc saved up to retire early (about 2.5 mil) and live off the interest alone. I should note I had a little over half that amount when we got married.

I decided I would like retire at the end of the year.

My wife and I each work (no kids) and split all expenses. We each contribute to our own retirement accounts, and then pool a determined amount each month together to pay bills and do mutual activities.

Under my plan, I would still make my contribution to our joint account and we would split all bills like we always have.

The issue is, my wife was never much of a saver, and as such has a small retirement account.

She is asking me to continue working and put the money towards her retirement. I feel she is asking a lot, because that means delaying the goal I've worked towards for so long by around 5 years. I hate my job but the pay is great so I've been biting the bullet and working there long hours.

I feel slighted because she never made the sacrifices I did to save aggressively, and now wants me to sacrifice more so she can get the same benefits as me.

638,ESH,AITA for expecting my wife to stick to our agreement that I don't handle our child's bodily fluids due to extreme squeamishness when it was her idea and I made it the #1 condition of having a child before we TTC.,"My wife and I got married 8 years ago, and neither of us wanted children at the time. my wife changed her mind a few years later. I liked the idea of having kids because I do like older children (basically when they can wipe their ass and have a conversation about something other than Paw Patrol), but I am incredibly squeamish as a result of having a mild sensory processing disorder (I am also a picky eater as a result of it, which I hate). I literally gag and dry retch at the sight of blood/vomit etc.

She begged and pleaded with me that she would handle all the bodily fluids, and that all the diapers, vomit, pee, blood etc is on her and i would not have to do it. I didn't have to cut the cord, I could be up. by her head during the C-Section and didn't have to look down, I didn't have to hold the baby until they were cleaned up etc. She said if she was sick, she'd arrange for someone to look after those things (ie: her mother or aunt). 

I agreed, but made it clear that it was my condition of becoming a parent with her. I will work and support them, I will read to the child, I will feed them, I will change them, I will love them, I will do things with them, but I will not be patching up skinned knees, I will not be changing pee or vomit soaked sheets, and I will not be changing a shitty diaper. She insisted she will get up and do every diaper change, every spit up and vomit clean up etc.

I made my wife send me a text and Facebook message agreeing to this before we tried to conceive so I had it in writing and she couldn't try and say she didn't agree. 

We now have a 3 month old daughter. I adore her. But my wife is already ""over"" the agreement and calling me a shitty husband for not changing shitty diapers I tried once and literally had to run into the bathroom and vomit. 

I reminded her that this is what she agreed to when we had our daughter and that she can call her mother over or we can look into a nanny or night nurse a couple of weeks ago, but I won't be handling our daughter's bodily fluids.",2020-09-09 06:27:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ipat03/aita_for_expecting_my_wife_to_stick_to_our/,1575,3534,0.93,4
639,ESH,AITA For Telling A Newly Religious Coworker That God Isn’t Real,"This happened a few weeks ago but it’s been on my mind a lot. 

Basically a coworker of mine is a born again christian and he LOVES to talk about his connection to god, his “exclusive” worship group, his mentor, and a bunch of other stuff that makes me think Cult but that is besides the point. 

He was going on a daily rambling about the power of prayer and the importance of being connected to god and said something along the lines of “With prayer and Talking to god everyone can be happy and stop with that fake anxiety and depression bullshit.”

I suffer from some pretty severe depression and anxiety, i’ve made attempts on my life, and i’m honestly doing a lot better right now which is probably why i had the nerve to look him in the eyes and just say “God Isn’t real”. 

He didn’t take to kindly to that and while my other coworkers got a little giggle out of it, couldn’t help feeling a little like a dick. so.  AITA?

TLDR: Newly religious Coworker said anxiety and depression was fake bullshit, so i told him god isn’t real

640,ESH,AITA for telling my condescending SIL that being a SAHM isn’t a job?,"I (28F) attend dinner with my family every Sunday night. At this weekly dinner there’s usually my parents, siblings, theirs spouses and all the kids. This situation only pertains to my brother who I’ll call Derek, and my SIL, Gia. My brother (25) and his wife (24) , just had  their first kid at the beginning of the year. They’ve been married for about 2 years. Every time we’ve seen Derek and Gia this year, they spend the whole time ranting and raving about how great parenthood is, and my brother always goes on the longest tangent about how Gia is such a good mother and he’s so thankful she’s willing to stay at home with the baby, she’s so good at her “job”, blah blah blah. “Our baby is so smart he rolls over, he can do sign language” blah blah. I’m over all the bragging, have been for months. 

Two Sundays ago, we met for dinner as usual and my husband and I were sharing with the family that we think we’re done having kids (we have 3). My husband says our house is always a mess, we spend our off hours from work running the kids to their extracurriculars and if there’s time left, we’re cleaning or cooking. Gia says “You’ve gotta learn how to manage your time more wisely. I make sure the house is clean and dinner is on the table everyday before Derek gets home.” Well must be nice. First of all, you only have one kid, you have all the time in the world to manage. We work 40-45 hours a week, so at this point my husband is annoyed and I’m ready to leave. Gia continues her rant by saying she takes pride in being a “domestic engineer” and she thinks it’s very important that Derek comes home to a clean home and a put together wife. She also says she doesn’t nitpick or nag because that’s not a what a good wife does. She’s just happy to be alive☺️. Did I mention her only personality trait is being a wife and mother? Long story short, I lost it. 

To be exact, I said: 
“Well, if I had the privilege of sitting on my ass all day I’d be happy and put together too. We actually work and live in the real world we can’t play house all week. And you only have one fucking kid.” 

My brother refuses to come back to family dinners unless I apologize to his wife for cursing at her and recognize that being a SAHM is a real job. They always want to take away my role as Godmother. My husband thinks I should apologize too. I’m just so tired of SAHMs thinking they’re better mom because they actually have time to clean their homes and spend time with their kids. I have a damn job I can’t sit at home and slip while my kid is shoved in front of a TV watching Cocomelon. Honestly, it felt good to knock the smug looks off their face, but now my brother is saying I made his wife’s Postpartum Depression worse.

641,ESH,AITA for finally setting one of my roommates straight,"I'm a 20 y/o college student living with two other 20 y/o college students in a dorm suite. We're all experiencing cabin fever since it's been around 3 months of the semester and bc of COVID, none of us have in person classes so we go out very rarely and attend classes in our rooms via video chats.

I'm trying to commission as an officer in the military after graduation so many days out of the week I get up around 7:00am, meet up with other guys following the same goal and we train (PT.) Bc of this, I try to get into bed before midnight most nights.​

Both of my suite mates play video games. I didn't even bring my console up, but if that's what you're into, fine. The issue is that every single night they're up until almost 2:00am playing together and literally screaming as they engage other teams, die, win, etc. Every night as I'm trying to sleep this is what's going on, to the point where I can't even hope to sleep until almost 20 mins after they're done. Whenever I try to reason with them to keep it down, saying things like ""can you guys relax I'm trying to sleep"" they'll say shit like ""Okay so go to sleep"" and nothing will change until a little after 2:00am. After 3 months of tolerating it and showing up to PT exhausted, unable to perform well, last night I snapped. I was laying in bed when I heard one of them scream at the top of his lungs in a totally incoherent way, to the point where he couldn't possibly have screamed any louder. I walked out of my room, screamed his name, walked into his room and started screaming at him. I pushed his headset off his head, put my head about 1 foot from his face and started ripping into him, screaming about as hard as I could that he should ""shut the f*ck up,"" how ""I have goals"" and ""I have PT tomorrow which I'm going to have to miss because your fat unmotivated ass can't shut the f*ck up."" He sat there and took it and I started to feel bad when I realized he looked somewhat scared and didn't want to say anything back. I screamed I have goals which I'm not going to be able to fulfill when this is what is happening every single night, ""it's four in the morning and you're still f*cking awake keeping me up, have some f*cking self respect and if you don't find some respect for those around you"" and a slew of other insults. He started talking back to me after I laid into him for about 45 seconds, told me to close his door, and I slammed it so hard whatever was hanging on it fell onto the floor.

I considered buying him a bagel or apologizing but I realized I would only be doing that to restore some peace to our room, and that I'm not sorry at all, it was a long time coming, and he didn't even get nearly what he deserved for keeping me up past 2:00am every single night.

642,ESH,WIBTA if i tell my friend that not everyone is as rich as her and she needs to stop being so stuck up?,"Right so a bit of context here, I (15f) live in a county in the UK where grammar schools still exist. Basically this means that they are state schools but to get in you have to pass an exam which anyone is allowed to take. Its a bit complicated and hard to explain but basically the school I go to is super selective and a lot of people there are well off kids who went to private primary schools.

My friend (also 15f) is one such person. While she doesn't boast it or anything, she is a lot more well off than me. I live on a council estate in a town about 45 minutes away form London by train, which is where our school is, and she lives in a rich area of London.

Recently it was her birthday. I was planning to get her a bar of chocolate, because most people are fine with that and its relstively cheap too. However when I mentioned this to her, she asked me not to get her food, because she was trying to go on a diet. I said that was fine and asked her what she wanted instead.

The problem is, everything she suggested was WAY out of my budget. I told her I couldnt afford it and she went sort of quiet. She told me it was fine and just to see what I could do. When I got home that day, I sort of panicked. I had no idea what to do, and I reaply wanted to get her something. I told my mum and she said that if my friend couldn't accept what I could afford, then she would have to accept nothing at all. I thought this was harsh, but I didn't know what else I could do.

When it came to her birthday, I didn't have a gift for her. I gave her a card and explained it to her and she said thank you in that way that implies that she really wasn't thanking me at all. She hasn't really talked to me since. Another mutual friend messaged me to tell me she was hurt because she always gives me such good gifts and I couldn't give her one at all.

TL;DR My rich friend is annoyed because I didnt get her an expensive gift which I can't afford for her birthday.

I could be the asshole becausr she always gives me big or expensive presents and I can't repay her so for her it might feel like I don't care as much as her.

WIBTA if I tell her to stop being so stuck up and accept that not everyone can afford to get her what she wants?

EDIT: I want to clarify since a few people have mentioned it, the card was a completely normal birthday card with birthday wishes and everything. I explained why I didn't have a gift when I gave it to her - something a long the lines of 'I'm so sorry I didn't get you a gift, I got very stressed since everything you suggested was out of my budget'. This wasn't very clear so thank you for pointing it out.

UPDATE: Thank you all for your advice. I've spent this  afternoon making her some low carb cakes that I can give to her tomorrow at school and I'm planning to talk to her about a price limit for presents in future so its not so awkward.

I would not consider her weird or atypical by any means. We both are very normal and average, so at first I didn't believe her and thought she was joking when she said she liked the name George for our daughter. This came after we'd been discussing traditional girl names for our daughter, so it wasn't even like she'd been considering anything gender neutral previously.

There was no reason in particular for wanting to use George other than she liked it because it would be unique and she thought it would be cute. I disagree on both fronts, but more importantly, I was against it because it's going to lead to a lifetime of bullying. I can see our daughter hating us when she's older for forcing her to deal with a name that made her a target for bullies, and she would be within her rights if she did.

I told my wife my objections, but she insisted that we name our daughter George and kept aggressively trying to change my mind. That is when I said that only a lunatic would think naming a girl George is a good idea.

I have tried to backtrack some by pointing out that I never directly called her a lunatic but only said that someone who thinks it's a good idea is one, but that hasn't made any difference. The thing is I still do believe that it's a crazy thing to want to do and borderline parental negligence. I don't think a rational person would do it knowing the child will be the one to take the brunt of the pushback.

Maybe I shouldn't have said it, but sometimes the truth hurts and we need to be called out when we're so far out of line, which is what I thought I was doing here after she refused to listen to my concerns.

Things aren't great right now, but I'm still not sure if I did anything wrong here so I want to know if I am the asshole.

Edit: A lot of people are asking me why not use Georgia or Georgiana. I have already mentioned using a female take on George and she has said no. ",2020-09-18 01:27:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/iuwqov/aita_for_indirectly_calling_my_wife_a_lunatic/,940,2405,0.96,3
645,ESH,AITA for reporting my professor after she filed an incident report because I emailed her because I thought it was unfair she wouldn’t let me participate in a graded class activity.,"I am a first year grad student. I was a student who received at least high Bs but mostly mid to high As in high school and undergrad. This semester I have 2 100%s and an 82% in my classes. 

I don’t want to sound like that person who doesn’t take responsibility or blames other people for their bad grades but, I truly believe I am getting a bad grade in my one class because of the way the professor teaches, grades and assess our learning. 

Case in point the situation at hand: last week a ROUGH draft of our final essay was due. I by no means half assessed it but since it was a rough draft it wasn’t exactly my best work. This week we we’re supposed to be given another classmates fought draft to peer review. 

Instead of getting a rough draft I got an email from my professor stating my rough draft was not to her standards and I would not be able to participate in the peer review assignment. This resulted in a 5/10 for my rough draft and a 0/10 for the peer review assignment. 

I emailed her saying that I didn’t think it was fair to give me a zero for “missing” an assignment when she wouldn’t even let me participate in it. She responded saying that she didn’t think it was fair to make someone peer review my rough draft when it wasn’t very good. She added that a few other people were in the same boat and there were also a few students who didn’t even submit a rough draft. 
I responded saying I didn’t care about other students I cared about me missing out on points and not even being given a chance. 

I should add that I also work as a Graduate assistant and have access to a system that shows all incident twirls received. Sometimes during my office hours I go through and read them. I came across one from my professor about me saying I had sent her an irate email that was boarder line harassment (it wasn’t, the strongest words I used were unfair and ridiculous).I then reported her for blowing my email out of proportion. 

I was then contacted by the head of the department saying she had filed a formal complaint saying that she felt even more harrassed and targeted because I had complained about her. Am I the asshole for being upset I got a zero and reporting her?

Edit: in her email to me and her report on me. She mentioned she thought I was was getting “too worked up” over “meaningless” points.

Since it keeps getting asked: yes I have access to these reports and encouraged to read incoming reports.

The professor has no idea I have access to these reports nor that I read her report. She thought I was “retaliating” but complaining about her after having her report shared to me.",2020-10-20 20:07:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jexi10/aita_for_reporting_my_professor_after_she_filed/,279,527,0.94,2
646,ESH,AITA for letting my daughter take my sons bike with her when she moved out,"My daughter is 23, moving out on her own after college and found a nice apartment nearby. 

Over the past two years-ish she has taken up biking and has done it every day, in trails and paths around our town. She’s really good and bikes 20 miles every day. 

She uses my older sons bike. He’s 27, still at home with us. We bought it for him about 5 years ago when he expressed interest in getting into biking but he hasn’t used it. I mean literally has never once used it, I watched my daughter peel off the protective sticker over the seat and the plastic off the handle bars. 

When we were packing her things, I told her it was ok to take the bike as she’s the only who has ever used it and I packed it up for her and it’s now at her apartment. 

My son found out when he was out in the garage looking for a tool that the bike was gone, and threw a fit about it. He says it doesn’t matter that he’s never used it, or that his mom and I bought it for him anyway, it belonged to him and he wanted it back. 

My daughter is a people pleaser and offered to give it back but I put my foot down and told them it was ridiculous, she could keep the bike and if my son really wanted one and would use it, we’d buy him another for Christmas. He doesn’t actually want the bike or a new one, it’s just the principle of it. 

My wife thinks we should just buy my daughter one and let my son keep his, but why go through it if he’s never going to use it anyway? I think he’s being a brat, but everyone else seems to think I’m being an AH.

647,ESH,AITA for banning my GFs best friend from our home,"My (M22) partner (F24) and I are about to move in together next month. The flat is amazing and a really cool space. It is perfect for us! 

My partner and I have clashed over this friend before, she is a truly awful person. Not to my partner though, just to her own. She has cheated about 100 times throughout their four years and it is this moral issue I have with her. It’s disgusting. I had been swayed around to meeting her (which didnt happen for other reasons) as she is my partner’s best friend and is important to her.

However, i know she planned on sleeping with her partner’s best friend .. on her partner’s birthday. This happened. It was preempted, planned and the BF was passed out in the same room oblivious. This woman is garbage. Poor bloke.

Hearing this I am never meeting this woman, I do not want to associate with her in the slightest. However, and this is horrible for me, she is still my partner’s best friend, and I know she has got my partner through tough times. 

I have banned this woman from our future home for her morals.

My partner is very upset about this and is not happy with me being mean about her friend. I concede I did not need to be mean about her friend to her, I could have kept this inside, but I really really want my partner to drop such an awful person from her life. I am aware I could have handled that aspect better but AITA for banning her?

Edit: This isn’t about controlling who she is friends with - she can obviously be friends with whoever she likes. It’s about my home and my space and whether one person has the right to veto a guest.

Edit2: Someone pointed out that if she was a racist and not a cheat it would be obvious to denounce her. Just because the racism wouldn’t hurt me doesn’t mean i should not actively denounce it.

We were on a group outing with 8 of us at a local theme park. There were a few couples, including Jake and Sally, and a few solo friends. 

The day was going great and everyone was enjoying themselves. It was hot, so we all decided to go on the lazy river. 

As we were drifting down the stream, I ended up floating next to Jake, and decided to play a prank on him. I said “psst... Jake... Sally told me your secret.” This was just a joke and I wasn’t referring to anything in particular. 

Well, Jake flipped out. He spun around and yelled at Sally “why did you tell him my secrets you fucking bitch?” I immediately yelled that it was a joke but it was too late. Sally was crying, Jake was angry, and the day was ruined. We all went home and they broke up soon after. 

I didn’t think I did anything wrong, since it was just a joke, and Jake was the one who flipped out. But some of my friends are pissed because they liked hanging out with Sally and feel like I ruined it.

I just told my parents and she had to give me $200 from “her” account, and she’s not allowed in my room. Then she started to bully me about my mom’s death. I honestly had enough of it. I just said “At least my mom loved me, your dad forfeited his parental rights” and some other stuff. That made her scream and cry into her room. Now, I have to “apologize” to her for some reason.

651,ESH,AITA for Hating My Wife's Private Journal?,"Alright reddit, I made an account just to ask this question; here's the background:
My wife and I will be celebrating our 14 year anniversary this Feb, and throughout our marriage, particularly the first 5 years or so, my wife would write in a diary/journal. These were never hidden or kept secret and even when we dated, it seemed as though they were left out intentionally - left out before xmas/birthday with gift ideas, left out after a fight to know what the issue is...but also it was used to tell me really hateful things - how bad the marriage is, how she blamed me for the problems, how she thought about leaving. 

After a few years, I kept tabs on where each journal was (there were several), and just noticed movements of them. If the journal was left on top of the bed or table, I looked at it (and it was usually hurtful) but otherwise I wouldn't. My wife never told me not to read these and from our early years, I saw it as a passive aggressive way to communicate. However, the last 10 or so years, they've become very triggering - instantly anxious when I see them out or see her read them. So my impression on her journals are not so good at this point, then shit really hit the fan.

In 2017, I discovered that she had an affair from 2011-2014 and that it was with a friend of ours. I found out by accident (not by reading a journal either), and we've been working through the pain ever since. We've done counseling and we've done workbooks and my wife has really owned her poor choices. Part of our new set of boundaries was for her to watch an infidelity related video and journal about it, which she has done consistently. Where we have struggled is that she wants a private journal where she can ""spew the venom"" as she calls it, which I take as saying really shitty things about me in her journal. I have told her that it hurts me by what she writes in there but if she really wants to she can. She doesn't want to unless I support it (which for her means that I wouldn't feel hurt by what she writes), which isn't going to happen because I know what she will write and its hurtful. She has a lot of people who have tried to convince me that I am taking it too personal and that the mean things she writes are simply things she has to work through. I don't know if I really want to be married to someone who has that much venom to spew about me. 

So Reddit, Am I The Asshole because I Absolutely hate my wife's private journal?

EDIT: So I see a lot of people saying I shouldn't have read a private journal. Up until the affair was exposed, she had encouraged me to read them if I wanted to, at no point was this a private thing. Once we had our Dday and talked through the affair boundaries, we agreed on transparency. She can have a private journal that I won't read, I've encouraged her to password protect it if she feels inclined. However, the issue is she wants me to not hate her private journal, but I do.",2020-11-14 18:11:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ju6bu0/aita_for_hating_my_wifes_private_journal/,92,107,0.89,0
652,ESH,AITA - She stole my curtains five years ago and I want them back!,"My coworkers think I'm an absolute nutcase for pursuing this, so I'm hoping I can get unbiased feedback. I'll try to write everything as straightforward as I can.

\-I sold my house in Kentucky in June 2015. It was as smooth transaction, although the new owners were peeved that I didn't include my drapes. The real estate agent explained that I had just purchased them and would be taking them with me. It did not interrupt the sale of the house, it was the most minuscule blimp.

\- After the sale, I remained in the town for one month while I prepared to move across the country. I spent the month crashing with different friends, instead of doing a 1 month rental.

\- In this month, I purchased the same curtains but now in a different color.  *I recognize that this is absurd. i just love the pattern so much that I couldn't resist*. They were from Anthropologie and for four panels, it was about $600.

\-During my rush to order, I did not enter my friend's address. They shipped to my old address.

\-Within two days, I left a note saying that I had something shipped to their address on accident to please reach out when it arrives and provided contact information.

\-After I saw from the tracking number that they had arrived, I left a second message. Again, I provided my phone number and email address because I didn't have a permanent address.

\-Still no response, so I spoke to the mailman who had delivered them. He said verified they were delivered.

\-I stopped by while the husband was doing lawn work, he said he wasn't aware of any package. He seemed sincere.

\-I moved to California, without my new curtains.

\-Fast forward to last week. I am redoing a bathroom and wanted to copy the layout from the Kentucky house. I'm surprised to see that the house is for sale, but I was SHOCKED to see my curtains in the photos!! Same color, same length, same quantity.

I plan to call her and as nicely as I can, request a proof of purchase. I don't have the speech planned out exactly, but ultimately I want the curtains to be dry cleaned and shipped to me. Had I just forgotten about them and never reached out to the new owners, that would be one thing. But she *knowingly* kept them.

AITA?

****EDIT FOR DETAIL ***** 
I never had proof that she had the curtains until I saw them in the Zillow photos last week.

653,ESH,AITA for expecting my “vegetarian” family members to bring their own food to get togethers?,"My (31F) brother (28M) and his wife (28F) decided to be vegetarian four years ago. It’s not any kind of moral reasoning or anything like that...they did it to lose weight. As soon as they decided to be vegetarian, they also got reeeeeaaaallll arrogant about it, too. They still, even four years later, will send me random articles about how my meat-eating diet is bad and comment regularly that maybe I would lose more weight if I cut out meat. 

I want to add here that they haven’t lost much weight, if any at all, on this diet. All they eat is pasta and bread, and still feel it’s necessary to lecture me on my diet simply because it has meat in it. 

Anyway, I host all of the family get togethers. Out of the 6 people that come to these gatherings, they are the only two that don’t eat meat and they expect there to be food there specifically for them. The rest of the family are big meat eaters. I decided early on that I was not going to make two full meals. Not only can I not afford it, they’re rude about it. They’ll call beforehand to see what I’m making and then decide if they’re coming based off of that. The last time, I offered to pick a separate pizza up for them and they could pay me back. They declined and then got mad that I didn’t order one they could eat and made a scene about it at dinner. They had obviously expected me to order it AND pay for it. 

I feel like it’d be different if they had, like, an actual food allergy or something. But this is just something they’ve chosen to do. Not only that, they use their dietary preferences to belittle others.

AITA for expecting them to bring their own food if they’re going to demand a dietary preference that no one else in the family shares?

654,ESH,AITA for making a post talking about my ex-coworker being rude to me about the stims associated with my autism?,"Edit: she was not mentioned by name at all.

A few weeks ago, I quit my job at a hospital, where I ran trays from the kitchen up to patient rooms. I have autism, and one of my stims includes quietly humming to myself to self regulate while I work. I also tend to make small frustrated sounds when I’m struggling with something. I’m not loud, but I get that it probably sounds a bit weird to people who don’t understand. I really liked my job and I was good at it, but I had one particular coworker who was particularly nasty to me.

OVER a month ago, I was working in the (very loud) kitchen and decided to take a break to use the bathroom. I was wearing a lot of straps from my various pieces of work equipment, and when I pulled them off they got tangled, so I let out a frustrated little yelp and was quietly grumbling to myself while trying to detangle. My particularly nasty coworker went off on a tangent about how “nobody wanted to hear me making noise” and I didn’t really say anything because I didn’t want to start an argument, but I did make a facebook post about how a coworker was particularly nasty to me and it hurt my feelings. I used a different name but it was probably obvious who I meant, since she was the only one who was outright nasty to me. When I quit I just stopped showing up, as my new job wanted me pretty much immediately. I forgot about the whole incident, and I wasn’t facebook friends with anyone from work, so I was happy to forget the place in total.

Fast forward to today, when the coworker commented on that facebook post with this:

“u made noises all the time and everyone was fed up with it. Sorry uve never encounted someone whos gonna be real with u so u dont continue to look like a fool but thats what u wanted apparently and thats exactly what u got.”

“we work in a hospital and he made noises everyday all day and in a hospital setting everyone questioned the reason he made noises”

“when ur making noises right next to me im definitely not going to mind my business...and im very aware u no longer work with us its been so peaceful since and this was brought to my attention so i had to address it”

Keep in mind, I wasn’t facebook friends with this woman. I wasn’t even facebook friends with anyone from the job. I’m also really active on facebook, so for her to suddenly find and comment on this post she would’ve had to go looking for my profile, scroll for at least an hour if not way longer just to find it, and then write all those comments despite not having seen or spoken to me in weeks.
i wasn't loud. nothing i did was particularly rude or especially off putting, i just tended to hum quietly to myself just because i was happy at work. I was never rude to her at any point. We didnt get along, so I made efforts to avoid her. My job was done ALONE, and the only time I was near my coworkers was when I stopped in the kitchen to pick up or drop off trays.

  I personally have never taken a drag of a cigarette, even once. It’s always disgusted me and was a turn off. The 2 of us had an agreement in the VERY beginning before we were even together that if I was to be with her, she would have to stop smoking. I’ve caught her numerous times in the past with packs hidden in her car or her purse. Tbh, I don’t think she’s ever stopped since we got together.. 
So here we are at the end of November and she’s 7 months pregnant and refusing to quit smoking blunts because ‘it’s my medicine’. Now aside from DSS probably going to be in our lives the second this baby is born because he has THC in his system, do I really think she’s stopped smoking butts if she can’t even give up pot? 
At the end of the day, I will love my child no matter what and give him the most love I have to offer. But am I obligated to do the same for her? Am I the asshole for telling her I’m going to leave her if my child is born with abnormalities or deformities? Obviously this is stuff I should have considered before knocking her up, but things happen and here we are. I always held out hope she’d quit but I guess time got the best of me. I don’t even know what to do in this situation. It’s keeping me up at night and making me crazy going thru her stuff when she isn’t home. This is not how I want my child to start his life.

I think I might be the asshole because I want no part in co-raising a baby with someone who only cares about herself.

EDIT; When I said I didn’t want to co-raise a baby with her I didn’t mean I was going to leave and not be a part of that babies life. I want EVERYTHING to do with that child and I dream about being a father every day. I just meant I wouldn’t want to be in a romantic relationship with the mother anymore.

657,ESH,AITA for telling my brothers fiancé that her college fund for her daughter is theft from my brother?,"So this all blew up a few hours ago. I am mostly the one in the family that is good with money so everyone recently asked me to look over their household incomes and build them a budget. When I got to my brothers I realized that about $300-$500 of all of his checks was being withdrawn every time. 
When I asked him if he knew where it was going he said to ask his fiancé as he didn’t know. I went to ask her and she said that she had been taking it out and putting it in a separate account for about a year now to build her daughter a college fund. I asked her if she had ever talked to my brother about this and she said no that she didn’t feel she needed to as he had taken on the responsibility of caring for her daughter (mind you this is not his child.) 
I kind of blew up at this point and shouted at her that not only was she stealing from my brother because he had not given his consent but that this was a needless expense. I help my older sister teach her three kids and her child and I can tell you now she’ll never have the ability to attend, much less the desire to attend college. 
My mother came in at that point (we all live together, but brother was away for work at this moment.) and stopped me, asking what this was about. Brothers fiancé was crying and told mum I had called her a thief and called her daughter stupid. Without getting my side Mum demanded I apologize and when I tried to explain she defended BGF and said my brother had a responsibility to the kid. I refuse to apologize but now my family are all mad at me and I have been asked to stay in the RV we own instead of in the house. 
The question is am I the asshole? I was only trying to stop an unshared upon and unnecessary expense they can’t really afford right now.

EDIT: it was pointed out to me that I could add to the context here. A lot of you have said that my brother could have dealt with this on his own. The reality is the he would never have confronted the situation no matter how he actually felt. I am literally the only person he puts the effort into fighting with. He cares more about his mining fantasies than his real life financial health.

Edit2: after my family cooled down my mother came to the Rv to inform me of two things. 1) while my brother did not know about the money coming out or where it was going she and my father were. 2) my father is coming home from Texas (visiting his father who is apparently about to die of lung cancer.) so he needs to quarantine in the Rv so “you have to apologize today so you can move back in.” 
I refuse to apologize even more now knowing my parents were condoning her actions and Andrew talking to my older sister I’m moving in with her and her family. We’re all cutting off our parents and brother for now which probably means they will have to find another option for FSIL’s kids school.

658,ESH,AITA For walking out of a job interview?,"I (26M) got offered an interview for a job I had my eye on for quite some time. I was scheduled to meet with three people within the actual office itself, and considering this was a job that could be done remotely, that raised my suspicion but I still decided to learn more about the position.

When I got there, the first interviewer (who was with HR) took almost 20 minutes to call me in. The receptionist was nice and all, and kept trying to reach out to them to see what was taking so long, but nonetheless that irked me the wrong way.

My interviewer eventually walked into the lobby and told me to follow him, no apology for the long wait. To describe him, he was a tiny guy, about 5'6, and spoke in that weird valley girl accent (important later). The actual interview went off the rails really quick. My interviewer was rude to me and cut me off a lot. For background, I live with my parents because they have health issues and I help take care of them, so moving out isn't an easy option for me or them. When the interviewer asked where I lived, I told him I lived with my parents in X town. He laughed and asked if I was too scared to move out.

I was still trying to be professional but he kept making snide remarks about some of my experience, the state school I went to, etc. I eventually got fed up and I felt like I wasn't going to get the job anyways so I decided to tell him ""you're being really unprofessional, so we're done here.""

He got mad and said ""so you don't want to meet the team you're interviewing with?""

I told him ""no, if HR is this unprofessional then I can't imagine what everyone else here is like.""

As I was leaving through the lobby, the HR guy followed me and tried to embarrass me by saying out loud to the receptionist ""he is no longer welcomed here, if he tries to come back in call the police.""

I told him to shove it and go make out with his boyfriend so that way no one has to hear his voice, then I left.

I had never walked out of an interview in my life, no matter how well or bad they went. I did kinda feel bad for skipping out on the other two interviews which would have been with some of the managers on the team I would be working with, but I absolutely hate most HR departments as it is since they produce some of the most toxic people, and if this HR guy was really unprofessional, I question the company as a whole.",2020-08-28 18:10:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/iic7yr/aita_for_walking_out_of_a_job_interview/,1117,6154,0.91,0
659,ESH,AITA for expecting my friend to buy me a new phone after she dropped mine off a balcony?,"So, a few years back, a friend and I were drinking and having a good time. We had this thing where we would drink and then drunk dial our friends.

This particular night, my friend wanted to call her brother, but didn't have her phone. She grabbed the phone out of my hands and as she went to dial, it slipped out of her hands, onto the ground, under the railing and down 18 floors.

I was furious that she had grabbed the phone out of my hands to begin with, because I didn't like her brother and didn't want to talk to him and then on top of that she dropped it as she was dialing him. I lost years worth of pictures and videos because I wasn't cloud savvy back in the day.

To this day, we are still friends but it gets brought up from time to time and we get into arguments over it. I still think she owes me a phone. Am I the asshole for thinking that she owes me a phone and being a little bit upset to this day that she's taken no ownership of this?

I get it - nothing good happens when you're drinking and drunk dialing but at the end of it, I didn't drop my damn phone - she did and I'm the one who had to pay to replace it. Didn't even offer sharing the cost. Just nothing.

EDIT: While this did happen years ago, it more so comes up now as a salty jab from me time to time - not an argument. Let me be passive! We are still friends but I still want her to admit she was an asshole, that she dropped it and that she could have helped replacing it. I didn't expect a brand new phone, but covering the cost for a new working phone, that is comparable with what I had, would have at least been nice.

661,ESH,WIBTA if I didn’t let FOB girlfriend into the wedding?,"Warning mobile phone. Ok here goes.... my daughter is getting married on Thursday. Her father and I have been divorced for 15 years and have a pretty good relationship. My daughter and her fiancé have told everyone that only immediate family is to wear the wedding colors. Not an unreasonable request in my opinion. So her dad’s gf sends a pic of a shiny gold pants suit that she wants to wear to the wedding (gold is one of the colors as is navy and burgundy). My daughter reminds her dad that the colors are for immediate family only. She also tells the gf very politely the same thing. Everything seems fine. That was about a month ago. 

Two weeks ago I asked her dad if his gf found a dress yet. He proceeds to show me a navy dress! I told him that our daughter told him AND his gf that the colors were for immediate family only. He got very defensive and told me “she can purchase more than one dress. It’s not my place to say what she can and can not buy or wear”. I told him that if she shows up in the wedding colors I will make her leave, if he doesn’t like it he can go with her. 

Last week he tells my daughter that the black dress she bought along with the navy dress doesn’t fit and she’s having a hard time finding a cress for the wedding...... I call bs. 

Today the tux he ordered for the wedding doesn’t fit so he has nothing to wear..... again I call bs. 

If these two ppl try to ruin my daughter’s wedding I may just lose my shit. Her dad originally wanted to wear a gold suit himself but my daughter said no. I’m afraid he’s going to wear it anyway (yes he has one and it’s awful). I don’t understand why it’s so hard to do something as simple as renting a tux or wearing any other color. 

I am the one giving our daughter away, her choice. So it’s not like the ceremony would be ruined if he wasn’t there. I really want her to have the wedding she desires and deserves. But would I be wrong if I told them to go change??

Edit: I feel like it’s important to give some background here. I’m not trying to be defensive so I truly hope it doesn’t come off that way. When her father and I divorced he chose to not be truly involved. He only saw my kids once a year for approximately 8 years. He would make plans and then cancel only for my kids to find out later that he went somewhere with a woman. (I did not reveal just to be clear) It’s a sore subject with my daughter in that her dad has consistently put a woman he’s seeing before his children. My daughter feels(and I agree) that the choice to wear her wedding colors when specifically asked not to is not only tacky but disrespectful when there are literally hundreds of other colors to choose from. It’s not like anyone is saying don’t wear blue at all. She’s just asking that people who plan on being in the wedding pictures (dad and brother’s gf) not wear navy blue.",2020-10-07 00:52:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/j6he1c/wibta_if_i_didnt_let_fob_girlfriend_into_the/,364,758,0.94,0
662,ESH,AITA for telling my boyfriend he can't get KFC because I can't eat it?,"For the last week I have been experiencing major abdominal pain and vomiting after eating. I visited my GP a couple days ago and he thinks it might be a gallbladder issue, so I've been on a plain food diet until I can some tests done. I've been eating 1 or 2 small meals a day which has left me unsatisfied and ravenous, but I don't dare eat anything else unless I want to be up all night in excruciating pain, puking my guts out.

After another day of pitiful meals, I was complaining to my boyfriend about how all I want is a big juicy cheeseburger or KFC (our favourite guilty pleasures when we order in), to which he replied that KFC sounded good and we should get it. I reminded him that there is no way I could eat fried chicken in my current state, so he said he'd just get it for himself then (as in, get it delivered to our house so he can eat it while I watch from bed).

And this is where the disagreement began. I told him that it's selfish to order the thing I'm craving for himself when I can't eat it. However he thinks it's selfish that I should deny him something he wants to eat just because I can't have it. I asked him to wait until I'm better so we could have KFC together, to which he replied that he shouldn't have to wait if he wants it now. I think he should show a bit of solidarity and forgo fried chicken for a few days while his girlfriend is stuck eating unbuttered toast, and he thinks I'm being controlling.

663,ESH,AITA for agreeing to a trip without asking my wife first?,"So let me begin by saying that this is my first post so I am sorry if I screw up anywhere. I am however someone who frequently looks at this subreddit and it is another post I saw today that was kind of similar though with some big differences that made me decide to post myself.

Me and my wife have been married for a little over 7 years and we have 3 kids 2 girls and one boy. Of course as you might imagine having 3 kids under 7 it all has a tendency to get a little overwhelming for both of us, but we are doing fine all in all. Our day to day is pretty similar to a lot of people I think. I work 50 or so hours a week and help out a load when I get home from work and in the weekends meanwhile my wife is a stay at home mom so takes care of the kids and does most of the housework. 

In the past 3 years my wife had 4 occurrences where she claimed she just needed some ""me-time"" and pretty much booked a short solo vacation the first time around only telling me a week before leaving. I was pretty damn mad obviously, however I figured she needed her time and while it was a big and very expensive hassle to get a babysitter in time that could stay full days while I figured out a way to get days off on such a short notice. Like I said I was mad, especially because of how she went about it not necessarily because she did it, we all need some me time now and again after all. The next 3 times 2 times she went with 2 of her friends and another one was again a solo trip, but all of them were without asking me.

I guess it is pretty clear where this is going. Now I work a shitload, when I am home despite sometimes just being exhausted I pull more than my weight to give my wife some breathing room. On the weekends I take on most of the care taking with the kids and do most of the chores, again to give her some breathing space and I got to be honest, sometimes it feels like she doesn't do the same for me in that regard as she seems to think I never need any rest.

Well a buddy from college invited me on a long weekend fishing trip, I haven't seen the dude for more then casual talks in the mall in over a year and I immediately said yes, I feel like I have just as much right to a short vacation as my wife and given she never asks me before hand, why should I do that? So I didn't really think of it as a problem. 

When I told my wife however she basically exploded, naming every little thing she does in the house and how ""It's not the same"" when I pointed out she has done this 4 times. When she understood I was going whether she liked it or not, she tried to get me to take our son because ""He'd like to fish with daddy."" I said no and it was for me to relax just as she got to.

So you tell me guys, am I being an asshole here? She sure seems to think so.",2020-09-29 08:51:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/j1vkf9/aita_for_agreeing_to_a_trip_without_asking_my/,345,1745,0.96,2
664,ESH,AITA for going off on one of my best friends for her dating life?,"This past weekend one of my best friends came to visit for dinner and I haven't seen her for nearly a year due to covid and the fact that my husband and I were having the worst luck selling our house and were living with his parents so we never invited anyone over.
While catching up I asked her how covid dating was going and she said she was seeing a guy named C, he was a cop and things were okay.  She didn't offer up much else then, and my kids kept interrupting so we moved on.
After dinner she and I were cleaning up and my family was downstairs and she brought him up again.  This time she mentioned she'd been seeing him 2 years.  I asked her if they had been dating that long why had I never heard of him or met him?  And she said well I didn't think it would last this long.
That's when I looked her dead in the face and asked if he was married and she nodded yes and I went off.  I asked her how could she?  And why about his wife?  And how the fuck could she start something knowing he's married and she will never be nothing but sloppy seconds and since honesty isn't his best quality there's probably more.  She will never meet parents.  She can never really have a nontoxic relationship  and it definitely won't be built on trust.  And how could she be so fucking selfish?  I'm a wife and she was my bridesmaid and how would she feel if she found out my husband had a TWO year affair behind my back?!?  Our marriage would be destroyed.
She is upset with me now, but I feel like she needed a come to jesus talk.  She said she accepted that she will never have what me and my husband have but I told her she never will have it if she treats herself like free salsa at the Mexican restaurant instead of guac.

665,ESH,"AITA for telling my wife I don't care if it's ""her turn"" we're not naming our son Tuesday?","My wife (28F) and I (28M) have been together since we were 14. We got married at 21 and had our daughter at 25. Last year, we were going through some marriage difficulties and decided a break would be in both of our best interests, we both just need a little time apart after being together for so long.

So we split, and in this time my wife felt pretty awful about herself (I initiated the break) and ended up hooking up with one of her longtime male friends and she got pregnant. At six months pregnant, we reconnected again and got back together. Her friend had absolutely no interest in the baby (he had begged her to abort) and told us he would not play a role in the baby's life whatsoever. We agreed and plan to raise him together.

Anyway, that's the backstory. It's been two months since then and we've been really late on the names, I know. The deal was I named our daughter Charlotte (my wife didn't actually like the name but she agreed so long as she got to name the next kid) and she can name our next child. She came up to me yesterday and told me she was reading a book and found the perfect name. I asked her what and she said ""Tuesday"". When she first said it, I admittedly laughed out loud and I asked her if she was serious. She said yes, she was, and it's her decision.

I followed her around the house and told her absolutely no way were we naming our son Tuesday, he'd get made so much fun of! My wife said no he wouldn't, lots of kids have unique names and aren't bullied. I told her that yes, UNIQUE names not days of the week. She wasn't hearing it and pointed out she hated the name Charlotte and agreed on the basis she would get to name the next kid.

I argued that's a totally different thing, Charlotte is a NORMAL name, our daughter won't get laughed at because of it. My wife got frustrated and after arguing on and off for the rest of the day she finally told me he wasn't even my kid. I just walked off and although she came right back and apologized and that she didn't mean it, I was fucking pissed.

I'm not talking to her right not but I'm holding steadfast we won't name him Tuesday. I don't think I'm the asshole at all but some ammunition would be helpful when I explain to my wife exactly why it's such a ridiculous name.

666,ESH,AITA for defending my sister nor my wife when she told my sister she needs a condom for her attitude?,"I've been a long time lurker but I didn't think I'd ever make a post on here.

To start off my wife(28F Ally) and sister(26F Carrie) have never had the best relationship, they can be civil with each other but you can just feel the tension some times. Carrie can extremely judgmental when she's in a bad move and Ally  is not someone to hold her words, so yeah not the best combination. To elaborate Carrie has always had a height complex as she's average height but the rest of the family is tall. Carrie is more tolerable to us(the family) but not so much to Ally(also tall), she gets angry when Ally wears heels. If Carrie makes a snarky comment about it, Ally will call her out on it and a few harsh words would be exchanged.

Recently there was a small family gathering that my mom invited us to, we haven't seen her since before lock down so we decided to go. Of course Carrie was there and she was in a terrible mood. For context Carrie had just broken up with her boyfriend of two years and she was being judgmental about most everything but she especially feeling tolerable to intimacy between couples(except our parents). Now Carrie currently has a problem with the clothes Ally chooses to wear, Ally is stunning, has n amazing body and is not shy of showing off her curves. 

Carrie has been on a diet which seems to have something to do with her boyfriend breaking up with her. Ally wasn't wearing anything *scandalous*, just some ripped jeans, a sweat shirt and some ankle boots but as always she was fine as hell. Carrie had a problem with that and was pointing out how Ally knew what she was going through and still decided to wear form fitting clothing. 

Ally ignored her to keep the peace. Eventually it got to a conversation about how Ally was too vulgar and about our sex lives. Carrie was on full bullshit spiel mode and started criticizing Ally, saying was trying to seduce me all the times with the clothes she wears. She got to how much condoms we must go through and Ally broke and said my sister needed a condom for her attitude. 

My dad started laughing, and Carrie just kind of stormed off. We stayed for a little as Ally wanted to play with my niece, Carrie came down at some point and called me an a AH for not defending her. My brother said I was the AH for not tell Ally that ""she made an unnecessary comment"" as he put it. My mom told me I was the AH for not defending Ally before she made the comments, everyone else who my mom told the story to says that I'm the asshole for not defending Ally at any point in the conversation. Personally I think my wife is more than capable to handle herself and I did tell Carrie not to start anything with Ally before I left to play with my niece and I think Carrie kind of had what what coming to her.

667,ESH,AITA for smoking in my house around a pregnant woman?,"AITA for smoking in my house around a pregnant woman? 

I (21F) am roomates with another guy from college (21M) for about 2 years. We are both really chill and never had any problems. 

We have both stayed away from hard drugs but we do drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes and smoke weed. We have hosted some wild parties in this house. 

We don't host parties since Aunt Rona came to town but we both continued to smoke cigarettes and weed in the house. Neither of us had a problem smoking anything indoors and neither did our landlord (It's a crazy college town. He wouldn't have gotten any tenants if he said they can't smoke inside the house). 

Problem came in the form of his pregnant friend about a month ago. He said that she got evicted and that she was jobless and needs a place to stay for a few days urgently. I agreed. Obviously, we both stopped smoking inside the house. It was just for a few days, so I did my best to make her feel comfortable. But the more accomodations we made for her, the more she asked for. She didn't like when we played music or TV as she was a light sleeper and gets headache easily. The smell of meat makes her nauseous, so we can't cook or eat meat inside the house. 

Me and my friend just went to the roof when we felt like having a smoke. Days became weeks and I asked him when she was leaving. At this point, I am getting annoyed at not being able to do what I want in my own place. He told me how he is telling her nicely to leave without saying ""Get out"", but she keeps either begging for some more time or starts crying and he backs out. 

Weeks became a month and I have had enough. Since yesterday, I have started smoking inside the house. I mean, it's not like I deliberately light up when she is in the room. Ashtray is by the window, so I sit there and smoke when I want. If she is in the room, I just give her a heads up and then start smoking. I have also started watching Netflix on the TV when we don't have classes and started cooking meat in the house again. 

Yesterday night, she yelled at me about how an inconsiderate bitch I was and I reminded her that it's my place and unless she has paid rent that I didn't know about, she doesn't have a say in what I can or what I cannot do. 

My roommate is really nice and he tried his best to help a friend out (He isn't the father). But even his patience is wearing thin and he supported me. We aren't going to throw a homeless and jobless pregnant woman into the street but I am also done making adjustments to my way of living for someone who doesn't even pay rent. She can find a way to be okay with how me and my roomate live or she can find another place to stay. 

So, AITA?

Edit: PLEASE READ!!! Hey guys. We have decided to ask her to leave. Whether or not, she has things figured out, she has to leave in a week. 

She gets recognised as a legal resident if she stays for 4 more weeks. And me and my roomate really don't want that to happen.

669,ESH,AITA for telling my wife’s conservative uncle I like it when she wears revealing clothes?,"My wife’s extended family are incredibly conservative and believe a woman should be covered up completely. Whilst her mum doesn’t share these same views, there was still a lot of pressure for her to conform growing up. 

We got married two years ago and I’ve been encouraging her to dress however she wants to. Her style still isn’t very revealing, but she shows more skin than her family would like (e.g. she wears sleeveless tops or skirts that go slightly above her knees) and her clothes are more figure-hugging now. However, she stills dresses conservatively whenever she knows she’s going to be around her extended family.   

Our country is going back into lockdown, so we decided to go out yesterday to get some necessities. Whilst we were at the supermarket, we bumped into her cousin. She decided to go home and tell everyone my wife was dressed like a \[word that would probably get this post removed\] and her father (wife’s uncle) called ME to lecture me about it. He essentially told me as her husband I shouldn’t want other men to look at my wife dressed like that and I should tell her to cover up more. I told him I liked when she wore revealing clothes and I was going to see if she would wear a miniskirt for me. He hung up on me after that.    

He’s since told the rest of their family that I’m a pervert and a disrespectful s\*\*\*. The only reason I think I maybe went too far is because my wife is pretty mortified, and my MIL told me I should’ve just corrected him without “stooping to his level”.

I told her that I love her body but if she's uncomfortable with her weight (she is, she talks about it constantly) then to do something about it. I've seen her working out. She puts in half the effort of her friend, quits readily, makes excuses, and has even overblown medical conditions only to lose all symptoms as soon as she gets home. She claims to be an artist but she spends most of her time on her phone. She claims to be a pro at all the things her friend is actively practicing but she doesn't do any of those things and hasn't for most of the decade we've been together. I don't mind these things but this girl is a good person and a good friend and doesn't deserve to be treated that way, even behind her back, especially by her best friend. My wife doesn't work more than a few days a month and brings in almost no income. If she wanted to pursue anything, she is free to do it, but she instead chooses to complain and tear others down.

&#x200B;

I've been staying in my office the last two nights. Am I the asshole for speaking up about this? I don't know if this is a typical behavior for female friendships.

&#x200B;

\*edit\* I love my wife. We have a very straightforward manner of speaking to one another. Our relationship is not in trouble over this, it is simply an argument. I am looking for advice on how to proceed. I do feel like an asshole but I feel she is being unreasonably cruel.

672,ESH,"AITA for telling a co-worker he was being racist for saying getting my ears pierced at a young age was wrong, causing him to be fired?","I'm a first generation American with an Indian background.

In our culture, a baby gets its head shaved at a year old, and usually for girls, their ears pierced around the same time.

This was done for me. And I'd like to think it's why I have amazing hair. And I'm also very happy that my ears were pierced when I can't remember the pain. I love wearing earrings.

So I'm not saying I would actually do this to my own child since I'm not religious, but I do respect that it's a very important part of my family's culture.

A co-worker of mine went on a tirade saying me getting my ears pierced as a baby was bad, which I highly disagreed with. Especially since my piercing will always close up and is not permanent.

I let it slide for a bit and eventually said we can agree to disagree. But he kept going and I said I felt it was very inappropriate for him as white man to be trashing my culture and that I felt he was being quite racist.

This definitely made him mad but he dropped the topic.

One of our other co-workers brought up this argument to HR. I was then interviewed and I confirmed what was said. My co-worker was let go.

This happened a year ago. But when I told my friend recently, she said I was wrong.

673,ESH,AITA for giving a guy decaf instead of regular for expecting me to break company policy all for the sake of taste?,"I work at a coffee shop that serves both paper and ceramic cups. When we reopened months back one of the stipulations was we were not to serve out of the ceramic cups. Fine honestly I didn't like washing the ceramic cups anyway as I have never realized how disgusting the general populace is.

That aside about a month ago the company gave us the all clear to serve out of the ceramic if asked. One of my bosses has told us if we don't feel comfortable serving out of the ceramic cups we don't have to. All of us at the store don't feel safe serving out of the ceramic cups and really don't want to risk our health over a single cup someone got their saliva all over.

Back on monday I had a guy and his friend come in who was on vacation from california. He comes in and says 'can I get a medium latte?' I go 'sure' and reach for a paper cup.

""You can't use the ceramic cups?""

""We aren't serving out of ceramic due to covid.""

""But coffee tastes soooo much better out of ceramic than paper.""

""I'm sorry we are only serving paper right now because of covid.""

""Awe really you can't make this one exception?""

At this point I realized this was a fruitless effort to tell him no and made his coffee in the ceramic cup. He held this smug tone in his voice the whole transaction and I thought it was rude of him to expect a ceramic cup and not understand I didn't feel safe serving in ceramic. I didn't want to outright say 'I don't feel safe' but I feel like saying no and because of covid multiple times would have deterred him from insisting on the ceramic.

While I was ringing him up we were talking and he asked if it was state law we weren't serving out of ceramic and I said my boss told us not to. He made a sad awe and then I told him he can go to any restaurant in the city and he will receive a straw and plastic silverware with his entree.

However I made him the latte with decaf espresso. I was really irritated he wanted to risk everyone's health for the sake of taste and figured if he was going to be rude he should get decaf.

Note here I would never intentionally do anything to hurt anyone like giving them the wrong milk on purpose or giving them regular instead of decaf. That's the stuff of heart problems and lawsuits.

So after he left I went on one of my meme groups on facebook and shared the story with an accompanying meme just to get it off my chest. This one guy commented on my post and started laying into me about how I am a terrible person for decafing him and how he could have narcolepsy and how I put him at risk making it sound like I murdered him. I got really angry and told him to fuck off. The admins then banned me for 3 days for not being nice.

So AITA for giving a guy decaf instead of regular in his latte?

674,ESH,WIBTA for not attending my best friend's gay wedding because of my inheritance?,"Long story and I think I screwed myself here...

My (29M) best friend (28M) is getting married at the start of October at a smaller gathering at a family friend's banquet hall, catered by his family.

He's, obviously, gay. My mom is extremely homophobic and in poor health at 65, diabetes, obesity, family history of heart conditions and smoking. I'd be very surprised if she made it to another election cycle, 4 years.

She never liked my friend, but let it go once I became engaged to my current fiancee, probably because she thought I might be gay. I told her I was going to not only be at the wedding, but the *BEST MAN* at the wedding and she flipped out. My dad passed away about 5 years ago and provided very well for us, annuity, stocks and 2 property houses rented out and my mom knew the power that has. Even split with 2 other brothers, I'll inherent well over 5 million. 

Her words were ""if you go to that f@g wedding, we'll see how much you get"". Unfortunately, I told her the date before this point and she'll know where to expect me on that day. I've tried to get her to be reasonable but she isn't budging. She's been a bitter, hateful woman for 60+ years and she's going out a bitter, hateful woman.

I told my best friend and he is furious with me, as is my fiancee. We are very well off, I'm a pharmacist who hasn't felt the effects of COVID at all, to be honest, and she's a human resources associate. We are extremely comfortable and have never stressed over money, but not millionaires....which we could be.

I asked my best friend if he would consider a long engagement, him and his fiancee proposed and planned the wedding inside a year. And my mom is not going to last much longer, but he isn't concerned beyond ""you're choosing your homophobic mom over me""

That line hurt me and I'm just choosing her money right now, but even that doesn't seem like it is worth it. My fiancee has said she knows it is a lot of money, but she says we have 6 figures in the bank already and my job has no threat of downsizing or phasing out.

Still..... I would be set for like and take a 10+ start on my retirement. And he's not willing to find a compromise at all, not that he should have to at the end of the day.

WIBTA if I don't attend my best friend's gay wedding?

675,ESH,AITA for not eating my other half’s roast dinners that he makes every Sunday and recommending he stops making them?,"To put into context pre-Covid I was a head chef of a successful restaurant, but due to on going lockdown nonsense, I know run a place doing takeout food and work most nights. I come home from work at 11-11:30pm on average and my partner works 9-5. Previously I would finish early on a Sunday night and we would cook a roast dinner together and it was very nice, but now I’m coming home later, I’m not interested in eating a big meal and he is also pretty much drunk by the time I get home in the evenings.

Recently I’ve noticed the quality of the roast dinner on a Sunday getting worse and worse. Yorkshire puddings aren’t rising or being cooked enough, chicken is over cooked, and I’ve found myself basically ignoring the entire roast dinner, making a sandwich out of some of the dark meat that isn’t bone-dry and having it with some soup before bed.

He was getting upset that I wasn’t appreciating his effort, as he was putting in 4-5 hours prep work into the meal for me to just ignore it and leave it for him to eat as leftovers.

So I said that I wasn’t super hungry that late at night, that the food quality was getting worse because he was drinking more and that he should maybe not bother unless I get time off with him to cook it together.

He got really offended and said I was talking to him like I talk to my staff etc. And that I thought I was Gordon Ramsey when I’m just running a takeout. Which I thought was nonsense because I’m fair with everyone, but I just didn’t want to eat food that I didn’t enjoy out of politeness that late and ruin my sleep because of it.

He said he’s not going to change his roast making, even when I said I would give him recipes to follow l, shopping lists etc and pay for the ingredients. But I just can’t bring myself to sit alone at night and eat a reheated, overcooked, crap roast dinner at midnight after a busy weekend.

Even when I suggested he cook a brisket or roast pork instead of chicken because they “improve” if they get overcooked, rather than chicken which turns to chalk, and he took it as an insult for some reason.

676,ESH,AITA for not criticizing my boyfriend's cooking until he basically forced me to?,"My boyfriend ""Kyle"" and I have only been official for the past couple of months. Usually we hang at my place but last night, he thought it would be nice for me to come over to his apartment as his roommate was out of town visiting his parents. He wanted to cook for me, which I thought was super sweet until it actually happened.

So I went over and watched some TV while he cooked. He didn't want my help at all, which is fine with me because I'm admittedly a pretty shitty cook. Sometimes i'll make pasta but I do a lot of takeout. He made pork chops and sauteed some spinach. When we ate, he kept asking if I liked the food. The pork chops were great so I told him that. The spinach wasn't good, he used way too much oil but I didn't really care because it was really not that big of a deal to me. 

But he just kept asking if I liked the dinner. Like we were talking about work and then he would just bring it back to if I really liked the food. I don't know how many times I had to compliment his fucking pork chops. I was kind of picking at the spinach and he specifically asked me if I liked the spinach. I said it was good because I honestly didn't want to get into a whole thing about it because again, I really appreciated that he cooked in the first place and some oily spinach didn't matter and it was edible.

Then he was like ""You're lying, why are you lying?"" I then basically said I was eating it and I asked him why he was getting so fucking pissed about it. I was pissed off because he was getting so angry when I was trying to be polite and appreciative of his nice dinner. He told me that he didn't want a LIAR for a girlfriend. This REALLY pissed me off and I told him something like ""Fine, your spinach is fucking trash. It's garbage. ARE YOU FUCKING HAPPY NOW?"" I don't think thats exactly what I said but I was like beyond angry. He  got smug and smiled and was like ""I knew it. Was that so hard?"" 

Kyle can be stubborn and obsessed with being right sometimes but on the other hand, so can I. I told him that he can enjoy the rest of his shitty spinach alone and I bounced out of the apartment. We've both texted that last night was ""crazy"" but neither of us apologized lol. But anyway, AITA?

update: I showed Kyle this post and both of us are very amused that the final verdict is we both suck. We agree!

677,ESH,AITA for assigning a racist woman next to an African-American man?,"So my office re-opened last week w/ social distancing cause my team is fairly small, but we all had to take a COVID-19 test. My superior was busy handling re-opening procedures, so he made me in charge of keeping people in line and basically handling the entire first floor. (Again, my office is pretty small) So a lot of people start trickling in and find their assigned place in line, when this woman walks up to me and claims that she feels ""uncomfortable being in line near a black man"". (The ""black man"" she was referring to was actually a friend of mine who I explained this all to, later.) This woman was new here and worked a floor above me, so we didn't know each other well, and when she said that, it took everything I had to keep myself from slugging her.  I instead, moved her up in line next to him. I gave her a new line tag and the expression on her face morphed into some mix of anger and shock. She said I wasn't respecting her beliefs and that I was being rude, and then she stormed off. I told my girlfriend about this and she agreed the woman was super racist, but said I should've just respected her opinion and moved her away instead of acting immature. But I still think I'm in the right for this. AITA reddit?

Edit: So after reading every post, I never realized what I might've put my friend through, so I called him up and I sincerely apologized for unknowingly making him uncomfortable and upset.

678,ESH,AITA for telling my brother (25M) he shouldn't have brought his girlfriend (24F) to my wedding?,"I swear, this sounds fake. My brother has subjected me to a sitcom plot.

My third wedding anniversary was this week. My wedding was absolutely beautiful and I am so happily married to my husband. With regards to guests, I explained to my family that we really only wanted serious partners to attend as plus ones, i.e. spouses and fiancé(e)s, to keep numbers manageable and make sure we didn't have random exes in various photos. Liam messaged us shortly before the wedding asking if we could extend that rule to include his girlfriend, as he would be the only immediate family on his own. We agreed. I had some vague idea of him having a girlfriend, but given how busy we both are and that we are both bad at keeping in contact, I didn’t know or question too much.

The wedding was lovely and went off without a hitch. Rose was a very sweet girl, very intelligent and kind and absolutely gorgeous, and she and Liam seemed like a very cute couple. We spoke very briefly about their relationship, meeting at university, together for a year and a half, and so on. There were a few cracks made about the wedding giving Rose some ideas, and that was really it.  I had no reason to interrogate them, of course.

Fast forward to this week and Liam and Rose are visiting my husband and I for dinner and drinks. We’re relaxing on the porch, a little tipsy, and Rose mentions Liam’s gift to celebrate three years together. Cue my surprise. Rose immediately realizes she fucked up and Liam is cracking up. I say I thought you were together more than a year at my wedding? And Liam replies no, me and Rose matched on Tinder two weeks beforehand and I invited her to your wedding as our first date. Apparently mostly as a joke.

I told him he absolutely should not have done that and that he had really hurt my feelings bringing a total stranger along to an important event for me and for our family. He replied that, with my reasoning, he had done nothing wrong as Rose turned out to be a long term partner and not a random ex – my point is, he had no *guarantee* that would be the case. However, he thinks I am being unfair being mad at a situation that ultimately turned out absolutely fine, and I’m not sure if he’s right or if I’m justified.

There is no chance of me cutting contact with Liam or Rose over this argument; just looking for outside perspectives and judgements. Am I being unfair?

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** okay, holy crap, apparently I majorly missed up with the phrasing of this post, so sorry if any judgements are invalidated when I say that I spoke to my husband and apparently we did not give ANYONE a plus one. We sent out invites to our guests and their partners \[Mr and Mrs John Doe, or Mr Joe Smith and Ms Jane Smith, for example\], there were NO invites labelled ""Mr John Doe and Guest"". This whole time I've been referring to ""our"" guest as the guest and their partner as ""their plus one"", which is apparently... totally incorrect, because they were named on the card. Apologies.

My brother was the ONLY one given a blank ""plus one"" card, and even then he had told me it was his serious girlfriend of a year plus. Turns out he'd broken up with his girlfriend a few months earlier, hence being on Tinder, and hence meeting Rose.

I genuinely threw this down and didn't think much about it but people have really latched onto the photo point, I almost regret including it. The logistics and expense was much more important to me in reality. Tbh, it was mostly just that we wanted to have our family & friends with us for the day, not the guy or girl someone had taken up with for six weeks or whatever... ofc married couples can divorce and so on, but they were more likely to be close to us than New Boyfriend #6, you know?  The photos were a minor point, of course long term couples can divorce and so on, but we wanted to be surrounded by people we knew who were members of our family or friend groups rather than the girl or guy someone was dating for six weeks at the time.

679,ESH,AITA for putting my husbands dog outside?,"Update: I have decided to rehome the dog even if my husband is not happy about it, I understand 100% how wrong it is to keep her outside I was just scared to rehome her without my husbands permission but I now know this is what I need to do. Thank you all who were polite and helpful 


Okay alittle background information here, I got a dog for my birthday about a year ago, the dog was very friendly and well behaved and we never had any issues with him what so ever. But my husband decided he wanted his own dog so he went and got a puppy just a few days before our daughter was born (last year). I told my husband it was fine for him to get his dog as long as he would be the one to train it and clean up after it because 1) I had a c section 2) my hands are full looking after our daughter and 3) I do all the house work. Anyway it's been a year now and the dog is STILL NOT TRAINED! I mean this dog poops in the house, destroys the garbage and nips at me all the time! I've just had enough. And now we are expecting our second child so I know I can not keep being responsible for this dog so I gave my husband three options, 1) Rehome the dog. 2) tie her outside or 3)clean up after her for now on... He chose to tie her out but got extremely upset with me and said it's not fair I get to keep my dog inside and his has to be tied outside. I asked my family about it and they think I am in the right but his friends think I'm not being fair.

Edit: I just want to add in that he says my dog is my responsibility and therefore his is his responsibility as well but I have been the one cleaning up after her, disciplining her and taking care of her. I just don't have the time with another baby on the way to train her and we can't afford to pay for professional training. Also she has a heated shed that I turned into her home not just tied in the lawn (I realized that should be mentioned) oh and she is a German Shepherd Collie mix with very thick fur but we live in a colder climate

Edit 2. My husband doesn't want to rehome her and I would hate to do something like that behind his back. I have always believed keeping a dog outside is wrong but I honestly am out of options. She will still be walked and brought with us when we go places but she is just not coming around me and my kids because I can not trust her and I can't have her destroying my house and costing me thousands.",2020-11-27 14:11:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k21s05/aita_for_putting_my_husbands_dog_outside/,56,19,0.85,0

He said okay, and things were quiet for a minute as we made our coffees. Then, i tell him about some of the Xmas gifts my parents have already gotten for our 7 month old kid. He says “we just have to make sure she doesn’t turn out like a spoiled brat.” Looks me up and down “ask me how i know” 

Now, i had only just gotten the tears done from crying about my dad, grandma, and brother in law dying and suffering due to health issues when he told me he had to work to make sure my daughter doesn’t end up like me.

681,ESH,AITA for throwing my neighbors’ toys away?,"I bought a house earlier this year with my wife and my son. To one side of my house is the green space. It’s pretty much a wide open field with a swing set where the children in the block can go to play, or sometimes the neighbors have meetups there. On the other side, my neighbors and their 5 children, ages 4-11.

These children are very poorly behaved. They also throw trash all over their yard, our yard, and the green space, as well as leaving their toys all over. I pick trash  and toys out of my yard almost every day as well as cleaning up the green space because 1 it bothers me to look at and 2 I want our other neighbors to be able to enjoy the space. Often, when I come home from work, I have to get out of my car and pull scateboards, bikes, or scooters out of my driveway so I can pull in. Also, their parents put their 3 dumpsters out in front of my property and just leave it there for days after trash pickup, if they bother to bring them in at all. 

I have spoken to the children and to their parents about the toys and trash. When that didn’t work, I contacted the HOA about it who said they’d “reach out to them” but nothing really changed. I have started to, instead of returning the toys, simply throw them away. As far as I’m concerned, these things become litter when they are left out, especially on my own property. And I am hoping that they will stop leaving their things out if they realize that they disappear if they leave them laying around. 

I feel slightly guilty because it’s their parents paying for these things and it’s wasteful, but at the same time, I feel justified in doing so. Also their mom doesn’t work, she stays at home with them, sees the messes outside, and doesn’t do anything about it. 

In the past week I’ve thrown away at around a dozen toys (anything from McDonald’s toys, to electronic toys that make noise, to a baseball bat, baseballs, and a helmet), two thermos cups, a pair of socks, a pair of shoes, and a pair of scissors as well as untold amount of snack wrappers and scraps of paper and plastic. Some of these items were left on my own front porch.

682,ESH,AITA for “shaming dating single moms”?,"Provocative title but it’s not what it looks like. I admit I might be the AH here but I’m curious what other people think. 

I (27) have 3 older siblings. The oldest being Eliott (32M) who is dating Lisa, mother to two boys. Elliot and I have never really gotten along. My whole family had dinner Sunday night and my new gf came up, she was not there, neither was elliots gf. Elliot asked at dinner how I met my gf and I said the truth about how we met on an app, which honestly is super common these days. 

He responded something like “I would never date someone I met on the internet. That seems desperate and weird to me”. I responded “to each their own. I would never date someone with kids from another man”. He huffed and puffed and got all mad, which I can’t really blame him for but I only said it out of response to his comment. 

One of my brothers had to excuse himself because he kept laughing but later said it was a little uncalled for. My sister said my comment was a little rude but she gets it because Elliot can be an even bigger asshole and he technically started it. My dads sentiments are about the same as my sisters while my mom is just trying to get us both to apologize and hasn’t taken a side. I love my mom and kind of regretted my comeback because I’m usually better than that, so I agreed and apologized to Elliot but he’s not over it and is still pissed at me and hasn’t apologized for his initial comments. 

He says I’m way worse because I was “shaming single moms”. This isn’t the case it was just a quick witted comeback but I can admit it wasn’t especially nice.

683,ESH,AITA for making my girlfriend pay for a shower curtain?,"My (31M) girlfriend (35f) have been together for about a year and a quarter. We've had a few ups and downs but all told I think we are a pretty strong couple. In fact, we've even decided to live together.

However, I have a problem with one of her decisions which lead to this fight. I had been renting half of a side by side duplex from an older couple. When I moved in a few years ago I paid a $700 damage deposit. The husband and wife took me through the unit and when we got to the bathroom for some reason the wife made a special point about how she'd hung a new shower curtain in there. Her shower curtain was ugly, but I made note of it.

After I moved in I took down her shower curtain and replaced it with one more my style. However I folded the one that belonged to the owners and placed it on the top shelf of a cupboard in the bathroom.

Just a few months later I met my current girlfriend. We fell in love pretty quickly and she ""unofficially"" began to live with me and moved many of her possessions into my half of the duplex. For some reason she became utterly fixated on the shower curtain in the bathroom cupboard and began to insist that it was taking up ""too much room."" When she asked why I was keeping an ""old, ugly"" shower curtain around I told her that it was supplied with the area when I had rented it. She kept insisting that I didn't need to keep it around and kept asking me to throw it away. She wouldn't do it herself, but she kept bugging me to do it. I told her that the shower curtain belonged to the landlady and that I really didn't have a right to toss it, but she kept insisting that she wouldn't care. Finally I relented, just to make the stupid conversation go away.

Anyway, our relationship progressed and we ended up buying a home together. As I (we) were moving out I was going through the unit with my old landlords the woman noticed that her shower curtain was gone and I was honest with her; I told her that my girlfriend had for some strange reason insisted that I throw it out. She ended up deducting me $15 from my damage deposit.  I was pretty annoyed at this; not at her, but at my girlfriend because she wouldn't listen to me and wouldn't drop the shower curtain thing. I told my girlfriend that she owed me $15 for making me throw the shower curtain away. She insisted that she didn't ""make"" me do anything, but I kind of feel as if she did. But I refused to drop the issue until she gave me a ten and a five, So am I the asshole? I think I may be for making such a big issue of it, but it really annoys me that she wouldn't listen to me.",2020-11-24 12:09:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k03ue9/aita_for_making_my_girlfriend_pay_for_a_shower/,32,56,0.89,0
684,ESH,AITA For leaving a date at a restaurant,"I am 28M and single. Now that covid has settled down a bit in my area, I have cautiously started dating again. I use dating apps mostly and don't really meet girls until we've talked for a week or two.  Recently I met up with a girl I've been talking with for a couple weeks and we had coffee. I thought we really hit it off so we set up a date a couple nights later for drinks. That went really well too so we set up a third date for dinner. 

We decided on a fairly casual restaurant where we could sit outside and that wasn't too pricey. I arrived at the restaurant first and waited for her before getting a table. When we sit down she mentions that she forgot her wallet and asked if it was ok if I paid. We had paid for ourselves on our previous dates, but I didn't really think anything of it and agreed. It's not like the place was very expensive anyway.

The first red flag was when she immediately started being rude to the waitress. We hadn't even been sitting for 3 minutes and she made a comment about it ""taking long enough"" when the waitress came to offer us water and get a drink order. I honestly thought she was making a joke in poor taste because she hadn't behaved like this on our previous dates. She ordered a gin and tonic and when it arrived she took a sip and literally refused to believe it was a gin and tonic. I asked to take a sip and it was definitely a gin and tonic. She then accused the waitress of giving her the wrong drink to which the waitress apologized and offered to bring a new one.

I honestly wouldn't be surprised if the waitress just brought back the exact same drink, but the second one was perfect according to my date. She then insisted on having an appetizer because she was starving. Ok, I like apps, lets do this. But then she ordered the most expensive entree on the menu and a little lightbulb went off in my head. She ate half her entree and then decided that it wasn't good and asked for a new one. At this point I had enough and decided I needed to do something. I excused myself to the bathroom, found our waitress, explained that this girl sucked and I was leaving but wanted to pay my half of the bill. I also told her that if she told my date that she has no idea where I went, that I would give her an extra $20 in addition to the tip. 

It took about 20-minutes before my phone started blowing up. Text messages flowed in asking where I was, then when reality sunk in for her, she started asking how she was supposed to pay for her meal with no money. I blocked her after I got home and told the story to my roommate. She agrees the girl sucked but thinks I was a jerk for leaving like I did.",2020-09-25 21:34:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/izsk8d/aita_for_leaving_a_date_at_a_restaurant/,309,1473,0.94,0

He has mood swings and will often be snappy, which cause my wife to yell at him. I try and tell her that he’s just going through a tough time and can’t help it, but she doesn’t listen. The other night, they got in a big fight. They were screaming at each other over something stupid. I intervened and tried to call it down, but just escalated it. 

It ended up with my son going to his room and staying there until after we went to bed. Some time around 2am, he came into our room like a toddler. He said he was sorry and is just confused. He crawled into bed in between us, but my wife got on to him. She told him he should’ve been better earlier, and couldn’t sleep with us. This upset him even more and he started to leave, but I stopped him. I let him sleep on my side of the bed, as soon as he laid down, he started crying and saying he was sorry. I told him that I’m not mad and everything will be okay. 

The next morning, I talked to my wife about what happened. She said she’s still mad at him for yelling and won’t accept his apology because, “if he was sorry, he wouldn’t have done it.” I was pissed and told her he was just going through a tough time and was confused. I told her she was being a bitch and left for work.

687,ESH,AITA? For getting angry and flighting with my husband over something “so petty”,"I 26f and my husband 28m got new phones at the being of the year iPhones 11. When I got my iPhone I got my neon sharpies out and coloured in my phone charger the socket and cord, I also coloured in my headphones that come with it so I knew which on was mine and which is my husband. Now my husband is so bad at losing and breaking things. He also takes some thing of mine sometimes without asking. 

So about a month ago I go into the bedroom to put my phone on charge it’s not there, I ask him where my phone charger is I think (can’t fully remember) he said he took it to work. I got annoyed at him cause again he took it without asking. He said I could use his charger until he brings mine back ok cool. I can work with that.

Now last few weeks his charger not working correctly it works but you have to make sure it put in correctly on the right angle. So I asked for my charger back he say he doesn’t know where it is...so I’ve been using this dodgy charger for a few weeks now. Now I asked my lovely husband (we share bank accounts) if I could buy a new iPad. I had was still deciding if I should or not, when he said he bought one for me yay! (Again remember we share bank accounts) my iPad gets here a few days ago I was going to put the charger that came with it near my computer so I had a charger there and keep using the dodgy one in the bedroom. Anyway I’m heading to bed I walk in an he looks suspicious... I know my husband. I leave go check the iPad box the charger missing..

I have a temper I know. I blow up at him yelling at him he better not be thinking he is using that charger it my charger and no way in hell he is using it, he said it’s  only for one night I said you may think that but it never is you steal everything, I yell saying where my old charger he said I have it. It’s not because mine coloured in! I also yelled that you stole my headphone (I don’t mind that because I don’t use them but took them again without asking) you stole my charger and now you are stealing my charger again. He gets all pissy with me and goes we are not talking about this I’m only using it for tonight. He goes to sleep.

He work early comes home for lunch and ask if I’m ready to apologise for the way I spoke to him last night over something so petty and doesn’t understand why we even flighting about this.

So I a yell (if I’m angry I yell) I am so very that you stole my headphones, charger and now want to steal my new charger again.

He then says well I bought the iPad there for it’s mine.(money comes out of OUR bank account)

688,ESH,AITA for taking advantage of a menu mistake?,"Hi guys, 
I wanted to get your opinions on this one. It's no biggie, just i kept thinking about it and wanted to see what you all think. 

So there's this restaurant that sells sandwiches and pizza etc. In the sandwiches section, there are different sandwiches types along with their respective prices. 

They are set in an ""cheapest to most expensive"" order (or at least supposedly)

So I go there, i find that sandwich D s between C and E, and less expensive than both of them.

 Obviously, a menu mistake, but i thought i would take advantage of it. So I got that sandwich (supposedly 4$) he charged (5.5$). 

So I said on the menu its written 4 so you're supposed to charge 4, he said that they were planning to change it, so i said that isn't my fault, as a customer i pay what's written on the menu. 
So he gave me my 1.5$. 


So order comes, and it's not what i ordered (smth cheaper) and I only found out halfway through (wasn't focusing on the food but rather the company i had) and i thought its rude  to tell them that it wasnt it when i was already halfway through with it, so i ate the rest. 


I was back today to get the order that i initially wanted, menu still hasn't changed so i ordered it again. He charged 5.5$ again, wr had the same discussion, so he apparently recognized me and said arent you the one who came like 3 days ago and i said that that was me.


He then nodded sarcastically and said again to which i said it's my right to pay what's written on the menu. 
He gave me back my 1.5$.

I was wondering, do you think i was an asshole ?

Edit: I'm not from the US, no tips or taxes or anything are added to the prices on menus

691,ESH,AITA for making fun of my sister's sex life and letting my fiance laugh at her when she talked about how I dated my fiance and his sister?,"I became best friends with ""Kayla"" in university. As university life goes, people want to experiment with their sexuality and so did Kayla. At the time I kind of had a thing for Kayla so I was happy to be her ""Experiment buddy"", we were in a relationship for two months before Kayla decided that dating girls wasn't her thing and she was straight.

I was ok with it, I preferred having Kayla as my best friend anyways so it wasn't some major dramatic break-up that broke our friendship. We were still besties and Kayla invited me over to her parents house. I met ""Kyle"", Kayla's older brother. As soon as we started getting close I fell hard and I mean HARD. Kayla was cool with our relationship and it wasn't like a ""dating my sibling's ex"" thing because Kayla and I didn't really see the relationship we had as an actual ""romantic relationship"".

So me and Kyla started dating and can I tell you, he's the absolute love of my life and we got engaged a few months ago(woo!). I was on cloud nine, I love him so much and as an added bonus Kayla just went from my best friend to my sister. However I wouldn't be making this post if something didn't happen. Kayla's family was a little skeptical when me as me an Kayla were pretty open about the fact that we did date. They were worried it would affect their relationship, so the concern was real. Then they realized that there was no hard feelings at all and everything was chill on that side.

When we announced our engagement to my family, everyone was ecstatic and we had a celebratory dinner. My sister said right in the middle of dinner how nice it is that I got to have a sibling trial run before going for the deal. I just kind of sat there in disbelief that she said that and Kyle told her off in a polite way. She then proceeds to double down and asks how nice it must have been ""to fuck around in the same family"" and I told her that the reason she doesn't have a sex life is being she's too busy caring about her other's and she needs to stop being jealous I got the best of both worlds. Kyle and most of the family(including grandma) started laughing at her, and she left the table.

Later she pulled me aside and told me I was the asshole for talking about our ""private conversations"" with the family like that( she texted me when she was drunk that she doesn't have a sex life). My mom also pulled me aside and told me I was the asshole for letting Kyle laugh at my sister like that and ""that's going to start them off on a bad relationship"".Kyle thinks It was hilarious but there's an obvious bias right there, my dad laughed too but has since said that mom is right, so AITA?",2020-10-11 17:07:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/j995cv/aita_for_making_fun_of_my_sisters_sex_life_and/,129,1016,0.9,0
692,ESH,AITA for refusing to pay for my “daughter’s” medical bills? She isn’t even my daughter and my ex won’t contribute either.,"Long story short, my daughter turned out to not be my daughter. My ex wife and I divorced and have been so for 5 years.

My “daughter” turned 19 five months ago and I haven’t had contact with either her or her mother, despite my ex wife trying to insist. 

I get a call last week that my daughter suddenly had a stroke.  I don’t know how this could have happened at such a young age- some doctors think it’s her birth control others think it is a multitude of other reasons.

Anyway, my ex wife’s mother calls and said that 
she has expressive aphasia, incontinence, and is unable to walk. 

She goes on this long speel about how the therapy her grandchild is going to need is extensive and expensive, and that we both need to step up.

However, my ex wife and our “ daughter” have always hated each other. 

My ex wife calls and said that our daughter is the “ cunt that ruined our marriage” and that she “ sure as hell wasn’t going to subsidize her treatment.”

She tells me that I need to step up. However, as she made sure of, this isn’t my kid and I think it’s enough that I had to pay child support for years on end for a child that wasn’t mine.

My ex’s mother calls yesterday and asks why it was taking so long to get back to her, and I told her that if she wanted to preach about “ stepping up” so much, she could get another mortgage on her house and pay for her granddaughter’s treatment because I wasn’t going to be burdened with somebody else’s mistake anymore.

Now it’s been a day and the state of affairs is that 1. my ex wife refuses to pay 2. Her mother says that what she gets in retirement is barely enough for herself to survive on.

However, both are calling me the asshole for not “ stepping up.” So am I the asshole? Because I think it is them that are being selfish once again and it’s almost as if my ex wife thinks that putting her own daughter down will make me feel affection towards her again- a dumb and self centered thought. 

I also assume that a person rendered this way after a stroke would qualify for disability.",2020-09-21 19:42:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ix7oak/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_daughters_medical/,498,787,0.91,1
693,ESH,AITA for not wanting to exercise with my wife because even though she may be sick?,"My wife and I (54 and 57 respectively) both used to live pretty unhealthy lifestyles (habits of our younger days). We ate and drank like we were still 20 up until we were in our 40s, and our doctors told us that we needed to change our habits now or we could expect nothing good to come later on in life.

I took it extremely seriously. I started changing my diet, trying to go on walks or jogs when I could. Things like that. I always bothered my wife about trying to change our lifestyles, but shes one of those people who need something to happen in order for change.

She would try from time to time to get better, but always fell short or made excuses as to why she couldnt do it.

Well, something eventually did happen. It turns out my wife has some sort of plaque build up in her bones (..? Not really sure about what it is, just what may happen), and she may have diabetes or Osteoporosis or both, and now it's just been test after test hoping that it isnt as bad as we think it is. She is the first in her family to have any sort of medical conditions like this.

It's the winter time now, and she wants to go on walks everyday; once in the morning at like 6AM, and once during the night at 6PM, and she gets mad when I dont want to, or when I dont feel like it.

Its getting too damn cold to go outside, theres like a foot of snow outside that we have to walk through which I just dont really want to do daily.

She has thrown out all the junk food from our house, which is a complete waste because I like to enjoy  snacking some times, but I do understand the temptations, so Im not so upset about that.

Today she got upset that I didnt want to go for a walk with her, and actually had the audacity to say that ive been so unsupportive of her during a time when she really needs me, and cant believe how I cant even spend 30 mins walking with her everyday.

I got really upset, I told her Ive been telling her for years that she needed to change, and that I have always supported her, I dont need to be doing what shes doing at all, Im completely fine, and maybe if she just listened to me before we wouldnt have to worry about this. I do want to walk with her, but its just too much for me now in my old ass age.

My daughter made me feel really bad about the whole thing. My wife called her and explained the entire situation, and she says that if I ""truly loved her"" then it shouldnt be about me saying ""I told you so"" but rather ""lets work on this together"".

694,ESH,AITA for saying that I would report my colleague for foul language instead of helping her reporting another person for harassment?,"I(23F) had been transferred to a department since Feb with 12 men and only 2 women, me and another senior lady ""Kat"". In this department we were more like a big family than just colleagues as we are essential workers(make a guess, not telling) and it was everyone's company that kept us going through the busy nights, especially in times like this. 


I was the youngest and newest then, so the guys were very helpful and patient with me. One big guy ""Tom"" was very physically affectionate and he loves to pat, hug, mock wrestle, squeeze cheeks and lightly slap the younger staffs on the back, including me.


I don't mind Tom treating me like the guys, in fact I think that he just a sweet cuddly bear, and sometimes I squeeze him back too. I never felt uncomfortable among the guys and I know they are all decent people.


About a week ago we had one additional staff, another lady ""Amy""(21). As you may have guessed from the title now, Amy got mad when Tom attempted to hug her and when Tom realized that, he quickly apologized and mentioned that he thought she wouldn't mind because I didn't. Amy said something like this.


""Just because dirty sluts love getting touched by guys doesn't mean all women do!"" 


Obviously I took it as an insult, I haven't done anything to Amy and she straight up said that in front of all the guys. I was tired and I didn't want to start a fight so I pretended I didn't hear it, but Amy kept yelling at Tom as he apologized profusely with a few other guys trying to calm her down.


Later on Amy approached me and told me that she needed my help to report Tom for harassment, and she got Kat backing her up. Still tired and in a bad mood, I replied sarcastically ""Yeah, I shall report too, you for your foul language, and the guys will back me up because they heard what you called me.""


Amy got really upset at me because she assumed that all women should stand up to the men, but she's got nerve wanting my help reporting my friend after insulting me out of nowhere. Kat told us to sort it out before leaving because she feels that she is too busy for drama and Amy got angrier because now she has nobody to back her up, and she blames it on me.


Just to be clear, I am not reporting anybody, too tired for that shit. Tom and Amy can sort it out between themselves and I am not going to bother with either of them. Go on.


Info: After reading some comments there are some common misconceptions that I would like to clarify.


1. No, Tom does not touch butts and breasts, if he does forget about Amy don't you think I would have long did something about it?? Common sense people. Tom is like a brother or uncle to us younger staffs. 


2. We do work professionally but because our job requires us to work away from home, lots of communication and moving around, especially when we work overnights it us common for us to talk casually and joke/mess around to some extent so that we can stay alert. This us more than common office like environment so despite being tiring we a have god relationships with each other.


3. Kat is one of the seniors in the department, so naturally Tom does not mess with her, but she knows about Tom and as as I have no complaints she doesn't care what he does. When Amy got offended, Kat is also one of the first to reach her side and told Tom off. I suppose Amy then convinced her to help her to report Tom for harassment but since she changed her mind, Amy is alone in this now.


4. I don't mean to justify Tom's actions. He made a wrong assumption and that's on him. However, since Amy had be as nice as to imply me for being a ""dirty slut"" a, I see no reason helping her.
Had she also apologized to me we could have worked it out with Tom in a civilized manner without resorting to complaining to the upper management. But now, I don't want anything to do with the case between Amy and Tom, they are able adults and pretty sure they could work it out themselves.",2020-08-11 11:57:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/i7qh6k/aita_for_saying_that_i_would_report_my_colleague/,1333,5906,0.94,4
695,ESH,AITA for saying i'm the stronger sister and beating my sis in arm-wrestling?,"So, this is just so fucking petty and annoying. 

So, We were having a family get together, over the course of 3 nights, and me(26F) and my sister(27F) were swapping the roles of babysitting whilst the other got some rest. Now, my nephew(4) and my son(4) were both talking about wolves, because they saw a tv show about a wolf pack. I think it was a documentary or something. They asked me about wolf packs and how the whole Alpha Beta thing worked. 

I tried to explain that wolf packs were one big family, and that the Alphas are the strongest from each gender. This is when nephew piped up and said ""oh, so is Mommy the alpha of our pack?"". I found it cute that he was trying to make us like a wolf pack, but, without thinking, said that ""no, Sis isn't the alpha"". And when Nephew asked who the alpha was, I said I was the alpha, once again, without really thinking. ""But you said the Alpha's the strongest? Mommy's stronger than you"" 

I said that I was stronger than my Sis. Now, here's where my son started making fun of nephew and said ""my mom's stronger than yours"" I didn't realise it at the time, but nephew is on the spectrum, and takes so many things personally, and get's really competitive about everything, similar to my sis. 

My sis came up to me later, and asked why I was insulting her earlier. I said I wasn't but she said that I was openly claiming I was better than her. I said only the truth, and that I was stronger, but Sis says that son won't stop mocking nephew, even though I told him to stop. 

So, my Sis's solution, was to challenge me to an arm-wrestling match in front of the kids. Now, I'm pretty sure she thought she was stronger than me, so without thinking just challenged me, thinking that it would put my son in his place. I beat her easily, and my nephew immediately started bawling. My mom came to later and told me that I should have just taken the loss, but how was I supposed to know what to do, Sis never told me anything. Sis is now busy consoling Nephew, and doesn't want to speak to me. She told me quietly that I had embarrassed and humiliated her in front of her own kid.

My ex-wife and I divorced mostly amicably and co-parent.

I'm now remarried and the topic of children has come up. I'd love to have another child. I'll admit my wife is a little clinical and wanted to know my ex-wife's medical history to see at a glance if it was ""her fault"" my daughter has her condition. My wife wants to have children but wanted to know if we should expect this condition to come up again and what difficulties we may face.

I thought this was a fairly innocuous question so I explained that this condition was shared with her brother, uncle, and grandmother. I don't think this condition was even a discovered thing going further. I don't like to think of it as ""it's this person's fault"" but I think everyone is in agreement this condition runs in her family, not mine, so it is ""her fault"" if you wanted to frame it like that. At no point did I frame it like this except in this thread.

697,ESH,AITA For Wanting to Stop My Son From Smoking Weed,"Hey Reddit! First time poster here!

Recently, since I have been off work due to the COVID-19 pandemic I have had a lot of time at home to myself, especially with my son being back at school now and I have taken to cleaning the entire house and I have made it my routine to clean the house once a week.

Usually, I don't touch my sons room as to not invade his privacy, but I thought I'd be doing him a favour if I cleaned it for him so he didn't need to when he got home, but I was extremely alarmed when I found a small bag of weed behind his drawer.

Personally, I've only ever drank and I've always been heavily against all types of drugs, so seeing what in my head is the start of my son taking a route that too many other have taken and ruined themselves because of obviously made me furious.

I texted his mother and told her about what had happened and she said she'd leave work early but didn't seem to put much effort into her texts at all and honestly didn't seem too bothered at all, but I thought that it was just because of her mannerisms while texting.

Once my son got home, we sat him down and showed him the bag and he started shouting at me telling me I shouldn't have been in his room to which my wife agreed and said I was invading his privacy. Now, I fully believe in privacy, but it was out of pure kindness I'd even went into his room and I was mostly annoyed at him as in Northern Ireland where we live, weed is completely illegal.

After agreeing about his privacy, my wife started saying that weed isn't even that bad and that he's 17 and can do what he wants, this infuriated me and I shouted at her and called her heartless for not even caring that her son was doing illegal drugs and ruining his brain, to which she told me to fuck off and stormed out of the room.

I have punished my son and took the weed but my wife still isn't happy and is being really bitchy towards me, which I find unbelievably stupid as this is over our son doing things he could be locked up for. Reddit, does my wife have a point? He is 17 and I suppose it's better than him doing cocaine or MDMA but is it not our job to protect him from that sort of lifestyle as parents?

698,ESH,WIBTA if I ask my boss to tell my new coworker to stop talking to me,"I’m 20F and I am a manager at a store, not THE manager but A manager. I am second in command at the store I work at. We just hired someone who is 28F as a part time worker. Usually we joke around with the staff, have fun, and mess with eachother it’s an overall chill environment. But I think this lady is taking it too far. This 28 year old is acting really strange and it makes me uncomfortable. Today while I was training her, my boss was on break ( he is THE manager, first in command) and she kept talking about her ex boyfriend who apparently abused her and going into detail about what he did to her. I never asked her for this information. It makes me uncomfortable because I’m not friends with employees like that, so I don’t really care or want to know their personal life details. It makes me feel awkward, and I grew up in an abusive household so it’s not something I enjoy thinking about. She also asked me if I’m on birth control, talked about periods, and kept trying to have some kind of “girl talk” but I’m not that kind of person and I don’t want to be. It was just really weird that she would speak to me like this given that I am her boss, and also the age difference between us. Idk how to handle someone who overshares constantly, and I probably won’t confront her directly, but I might tell my boss to speak to her about it. Would that make me an asshole? I wouldn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings or make them feel like their problems aren’t important. It sounds like she is in desperate need for a friend who is also a woman, but I can’t be her friend like that, not with a 28 year old.

Edit: I think everyone is right in that I need to boss up and confront her. But I would also like to add that although I am a higher up than her, I have never had any type of training for handling work conflicts like this. But my Manager has had that type of training. Usually if people are posing problems, or are being fired, my manager handles that. My job does not entail that I handle conflicts like this. I wish I could say what store, and what my position is formally called, but I don’t want to say where I work lol. Also, people have said I may be unqualified for this position, but I have held this position for over a year now and have done very well. I just wanted people to know that it’s not really in my job responsibilities to be the one who handles conflict. Not sure if that adds more context or changes the story.",2020-11-25 00:37:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k0hj95/wibta_if_i_ask_my_boss_to_tell_my_new_coworker_to/,31,31,0.92,0
699,ESH,WIBTA if I asked my husband to replace the Christmas tree he always had while raising his kids?,"My husband and I have been together for 5 years. Before I came along, we had three kids (the youngest is now 17) and three ex-wives. 

Recently we were talking about a barbecue that we have in the backyard that we don't use because I originally bought it for the partner I had before him. He said that he doesn't feel comfortable using another man's bbq. In the past, as we've both been through other relationships, we decided that wherever possible, we would get new things that don't have the connotations of other people associated with them. 

So with that idea in mind, I'm thinking of asking him if we can replace his 27-year-old fake Christmas tree that has always been used while all his kids were growing up. I'm not saying that he'd have to get rid of the decorations that the kids made over the years, so he would still have items with sentimental values, but I'd like something that hasn't been associated with his ex-wives and that would give us a fresh start for creating family traditions together.

700,ESH,AITA for taking pictures of my girlfriend in a bikini.,"Throwaway.

My girlfriend and I have been together for 6 years now. We have a 15 month old together, and I’m very happy and content with my life that we’ve created together.

My parents, especially my mom, don’t like my girlfriend. They’ve never said, “I don’t like your girlfriend.” but they’ve never respected her. She would always be on the receiving end of their backhanded compliments and passive-aggressiveness.
Obviously, I couldn’t tolerate that shit and I started to distance myself from them. 

When we announced our pregnancy, my mom’s first reaction was to blame my girlfriend for getting pregnant before marriage (I’m not going to explain how stupid that sounds.) and to get mad at my girlfriend for choosing to continue her education while expectant and caring for a child. (she’s currently getting her masters degree) I told my mom several times to shut up.

My girlfriend was still working out through most of her pregnancy, and very quickly fell back into that routine after she gave birth. It was completely her decision, she’s happy working out and she looks great either way so who was I to stop her. 

My mom caught wind of this through a family friend, and essentially shamed her for it through a series of badly written text messages. I had to put a stop to it, and my mom just kept going. We eventually stopped responding to my mom’s texts for a while.

My parents came to stay with me because my mom’s best friend, who was living with her, passed away. I was very hesitant to let my parents come over, but my girlfriend convinced me to take them and let her grieve properly. I did tell them that I wouldn’t hesitate to kick them out if they insulted my girlfriend. They’re staying with us for a week.

My parents and my girlfriend managed to stay o it of each other’s hair. My mom actually gave my girlfriend a genuine compliment about her food (I know, it’s the bare minimum, but I think it took everyone aback) and my dad didn’t complain about anything.

Good things only last so long.

My girlfriend made a one-piece swimsuit and a bikini from scratch. She was really proud of herself and wanted to take pictures of herself in her bikini in our backyard, around/in the pool. It was all in good fun, she thought she looked nice and wanted to see her hard work. The “photoshoot” lasted almost 10 minutes, and my girlfriend immediately wore a robe when we were finished.

I’m assuming my mom was watching us; because her first thought was to ask my girlfriend why she was so eager to reveal her body. 

Then she went on to basically call my girlfriend a slut for posting “revealing photos on her Instagram” When my girlfriend took offense to that statement, and I got mad at her for being rude. My dad chimed in claiming that she could have waited until later to avoid being too distracting.

My girlfriend began to wear looser clothing around my parents because she was starting to see their point of view.

They’re out of my house now and I’m still pissed, but everyone thinks I’m overreacting,

EDIT: I did kick them out. However, I did give them a day to move out though so that they could find a hotel or somewhere else to stay - hence the my girlfriend started to wear looser clothing around my parents.",2020-09-09 21:46:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ippxww/aita_for_taking_pictures_of_my_girlfriend_in_a/,315,3919,0.96,2
701,ESH,AITA for expecting Dogs to listen and obey?,"This happened very recently and I am getting confused. I live next to my parents, our Properties touch so, and we see each other often. Both Properties are quite open and border onto the street, but we live in a village, so very few cars, mostly people on walks.

Today was the second time a dog ran onto our property to chase my cat. My Cat is an outside cat, but he doesn't move around much. When we are sitting outside like today, he wanders around us and will sit somewhere near. Last time, he was sitting on the grass when a little dog came rushing onto our Ground. My cat fled under one of our cars. This time he was sitting close to the street and rushed behind the house when a larger Dog from the house behind ours chased after him. Of course, I jumped up and rand after them, not touching the dog. My brother though was faster than me and took the dog by the collar to get him away. My Cat was fine.

The thing why I am asking here is the following: both times the owners of the Dogs stood nearby, just calling their animal and it obviously didn't listen. It took both a while to make a move to go after their Dogs and get them back. And today the woman even yelled at my brother to never touch a foreign animal, because ""People don't touch other peoples dogs."" To that my Father commented that dogs should not run onto other Peoples Property, and she lost her mind. She was screaming about how our cat would come onto her balcony, and we should keep him inside and how her dog is harmless and so on.

Thing is, both times the owners acted like nothing was wrong. Like ""of course they will run after a cat"". Like it's completely normal for Dogs to do this sort of things. Now, I never had a dog. I don't know much about dogs. I expected Dogs to come if their owner call them, no matter the circumstances and if not to be on a leash at least where there a houses and people. Or at the very least for people to be apologetic. If my Dog ran onto other ppls Garden and chasing their animals, I would be beyond myself with embarrassment. Am I expecting too much? Is there really nothing they could do, is this normal? AITH here for being mad at the owners, should I apologize for being somewhat rude today? The fact that both people reacted similarly confident about being in the right here makes me questing myself. Are there people who own dogs who can bring some light into this?

Also: I live in Germany, there is no such thing as ""stand your ground"". And my cat is fine. And the dog today wasn't aggressive, I think he really was just curious. I was just really shaken about the whole thing and didn't expect her to be this mad and deflective.

Edit/Update: Thank all of you for commenting and most importantly, giving me another view and a reason to rethink. I wrote the Post whilst still being under a lot of stress and worry for my cat being hurt or hurting the Dog. I will read up on Dogs and on what to expect from them and talk to a view dog owners we have around to which we have a friendly relationship.  

Onto my neighbor: I will talk to her when I see her next. I'm going to apologize again for my Cat being on my balcony and offer to get her one of the air cat repelled thingys for her to set up if she wants. We will also have the entire property, as well as my parents fenced in next year, as soon as possible. But I will also be adamant about her apologizing. My Cat was fine, her Dog was not aggressive, but still it chased my cat, and she stood on the road just calling, instead of getting him back. I want an apology for her negligence and slow reaction. I will also ask her to keep the dog leashed just for the way down her driveway and until past our House, which is about 8 Meters, I think that is a reasonable request.",2020-11-08 15:11:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jqd7z4/aita_for_expecting_dogs_to_listen_and_obey/,99,40,0.82,0
702,ESH,Aita for withdrawing my daughter’s college tuition?,"I’m father to a son (15) and a daughter (18). While we can afford basic living expenses and the occasional vacation, we are by no means rich. My daughter only has a minimum wage job, and my wife is a stay-at-home mom, so I’m the family’s main source of income. 

Last year, when my daughter was applying to colleges, we came to the agreement that she would enroll in a community college. The universities she wanted to attend were expensive, and I felt it wasn’t worth it because 1: I have two children to consider, and 2: she wanted to major in classical music performance, and would likely end up switching majors anyway due to poor job prospects.

Later, I found out she’d applied to several universities without our knowledge and was accepted to one. I was a bit hurt that she went behind my back and spent $200 of her hard-earned money on application fees instead of using them to help our family’s financial situation. But in the end I agreed to pay 75% of her tuition, given that she switched to a more useful major. 
 
My daughter ended up attending college via zoom due to the pandemic. Last week I found an amazon package of music books addressed to her, which I thought was suspicious because her new major didn’t require music classes. I confronted her about it and she confessed that she had never actually switched majors. She had been lying to me the whole summer. 

I was extremely hurt, as she was essentially scamming me out of money by going back on our deal and lying about her major. She had already betrayed my trust by wasting money applying to colleges she didn’t need, then again by tricking me into paying 75% of her tuition. I told her I was withdrawing my share of the tuition and that she could pay with her own money if she wanted to attend this university. She started crying that she couldn’t afford it on a minimum wage job and didn’t want to go into debt from student loans. She said her chosen school’s music program was better than the community college’s and she didn’t want to major in any other field. I told her she should’ve thought of all that before lying and disrespecting me like she did.

She started screaming terrible names at me and accused me of favoritism, complaining about how I was willing to buy a new computer for my son but not pay for her college education. I explained that 1: it was because my son had never betrayed my trust,  2: he needed his own computer because he intended to major in software engineering, and 3: it’s not like I never bought her anything. I payed for her clothes, extracurriculars, the band instrument she’s currently trying to major in. I gave her everything and she’s been nothing but ungrateful. 

My wife sided with my daughter and said I was being unreasonable. I just said that as our household’s primary source of income, I have every right to decide what to do with my money. I’d be happy to forgive and support her if she chooses a more realistic major or transfers to a less expensive school.

Clarification edit: my wife has her personal reasons for not being able to work, which I don’t want to state here because they’ll make our family very identifiable to the people who already know us. But her being a stay-at-home mom is very much justified and I don’t appreciate people attacking her for it.

Edit: I wasn’t upset with my daughter spending $200 on application fees because I desperately needed the money, I was hurt because she did it behind my back while knowing that I’d have difficulty affording any of the colleges she applied to. She placed me in a difficult situation and jeopardized her brother’s future purely on a whim. Not only that, she’s also an adult living in my house without paying rent. We had a deal that she’d pay whatever amount she was comfortable with every month; it’s more of a symbolic gesture than anything. It was such a shock for me to learn that after all we had talked about, she still prioritized a fantasy over her real family.

——————

Update: after reading through the comments, I’ve realized that my approach with the whole “symbolic rent” idea has caused a lot of problems. I’ve spoken to my daughter and set a proper rent. It’s very low, as I see no point putting her into unnecessary debt, but at least now there’s no more confusion over what she’s expected to contribute as an adult living under my roof. We are still working out the issue of college tuition and majors.",2020-09-14 09:58:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/isi0go/aita_for_withdrawing_my_daughters_college_tuition/,599,729,0.89,2

He (35m) drove to pick up a tinder date knowing she has kids. When he arrives, before he processes what's going o there there are now two kids in the back sit (his car) and the date is saying let's go to the restaurant. He drove there with her and the kids (he says she did not mention they were coming along) and then after dropping her in the restaurant, he said he has to gas station and went home (as far as I am aware he did not go to the restaurant order food and ditch her, he just ditched her before that). He said that way he was a gentleman because he did not hurt the children by disappointing them since they ended up going to a restaurant. Our friendgroup consensus is that she is off but he is the asshole, but he is definitely an asshole in general so we might be biased.

704,ESH,AITA For not wanting to vacate the house during my sisters med school interview?,"Hey, so my sister and I are both staying at home during Covid. Usually we would each have our own places in a major city. We are part of a large family four kids both parents, so the house was pretty noisy growing up. The house we are staying at is empty most of the time, both of us are there about 40% of the time. Anyways my sister has an upcoming med school interview. Last night at dinner with my entire family around she requested I be quite during the interview, everyone else will be away. All good no problems there I'm generally pretty quite person in general (maybe wake up around 7-8 and make eggs take a shower that kind of quite). The house has been no louder then general conversation volume for 6 months while we have been around. So I said as much and was like sure if I'm even home (probably going to see my girlfriend). She keeps making more requests along the same lines until she then requests that I leave the house for a couple hours since me being there at all 'distracts' her and would impact her performance. The examples I was given were of during her last interview I took a shower and made eggs. I pushed back on this pretty strongly basically saying that look I get you are nervous about this but that's somewhat unreasonable. The kitchen is separated from her room by a floor and probably 60 feet, and that I could shower downstairs since that's closer to her room (if I even showered during that hour). She continued... saying that even me sleeping would impact her shes nervous about people listening to her interview. At this point this had been going on for 5 minutes and I was pretty fed up with being told that my impact from breathing during her interview was mine to address. So I said something along the lines of this is neurotic behavior and I get this important to you but its not my job to go far outside of anything reasonable to cater to that of behavior. And that you should probably go somewhere else if shower noise through a floor or walking is going to impact your performance (note we have an office with a conference room 15 minutes away that will be completely open and empty).

At this point everyone in my family freaked out on me saying how inconsiderate and thoughtless I am. How she has worked for 6 years and you can't even give up an hour of your life for this. Basically that I'm a selfish thoughtless prick.

My mom (35F), on the other hand, LOVES instagram and is always posting our pets and family photos. She has a public account and she follows me, so a ton of guys at school thought it would be funny to start following her. One guy started commenting a ton of sexual stuff under her selfies and instead of blocking him like most moms would do, my mom just made fun of him. 

It was honestly pretty funny, so other guys started doing that, and my mom keeps coming up with these roasts back. A lot of her clapbacks have become inside jokes and some of the guys in our group will quote them, and now they've started showing them to guys that I don't know that they're friends with and these guys will start doing the same thing.

My mom's also a bit younger than their moms and it started as a joke but now I'm sure they're actually into my mom. They honestly feel like they're flirting with her when she makes fun of them and it's so gross having the general consensus of my own friends be that my mom is based.

I told my mom to stop responding to them, but she said that they're being assholes and she has every right to tell them off. I tried to tell her she's embarrassing me, but she just says she won't stop unless they stop bothering her first. I finally called her a gross cougar and now I'm grounded.

706,ESH,AITA for prohibiting my mother from seeing my child because shes tricked him into thinking she's his mom?,"Throwaway to avoid anyone recognizing me. I have a now 3 year old son, who was living with my mom(his grandma) for a year while I was away getting myself together. For personal reasons I will not explain why I was away for so long, but I felt I needed to better myself for my son. My mother agreed to take care of him while I was away. (I facetimed with him whenever I could)

Fast forward to last month, I come to my mothers house to pick up my son. He's happy to see me and me and my mother are talking while hes playing with his dinosaurs. He suddenly looks up at my mother and says ""Mommy, I'm thirsty"". I was obviously confused, and asked my mother if she heard him call her mom. She laughed nervously and said that he had been calling her that for awhile. She basically explained that while I was away she told him that she was his mom and to call her that.

I laughed and told her that I wasnt comfortable with that, since she wasnt the one who birthed him. I told her he should know that shes his grandmother, not his mom. She got upset and told me that he needed a mother figure while I was gone, and she was just trying to fill that role for him. She said something along the lines of ""Ive been his mother for a year now, and you cant change it"". We went back and forth until it got to the point where we started raising our voices. She spat out some insults about me being a bad mom for being away for so long and how she should be his mom cause he doesnt need a mom like me.

I simply told her that she isn't going to be seeing him anymore because I'm not comfortable with him calling her mom. We gathered his stuff and left after that. She blew up my phone for days, talked some mess to family members, anything she could to make me look/feel bad. But I refused to forgive her, especially after all that stuff she said. 

AITA?

Edit: A word

For those of you saying I abandoned him, I didnt. I was too sick to take care of him. That's all I'm going to say about that. I couldn't be the best mother to him cause of my medical issues. I wanted to be there for him. I didnt just ""dump"" him on my mother. I feel the need to explain that cause people are getting the wrong idea.

It was possible for him to visit but my mom said it would be best if he didnt see me like that cause he'd be too young to understand. And I trusted her, so I didnt allow him to visit.

No, I wasnt in a mental hospital or rehab. It was physical health reasons.

A lot of you are saying you think I was in rehab because of the way I've worded things in my post. Rather than edit out the original, I'd just like to explain that its probably not the best wording to use for this situation and I understand that now. What I meant to say was I felt I needed to be in better health for my son. ""Getting myself together"" in my head pretty much means getting better and healthier. I apologize for that.

This will probably be my last edit. My son is getting a therapist like a lot of you have recommended.

707,ESH,AITA for protecting myself against false accusations of racism,"This incident happened quite some time ago while I was attending University.

I shared accommodation with people of multiple ethnicities, including from the sub continent and a black American. I arrived back from Christmas holidays early and had the place to myself. I had been watching reruns of The Fresh Prince. Believing myself to alone, I started to recite the opening theme in an imitation Indian accent, while I was cooking. I was also chopping vegetables while making “Hiyaaaa” sounds imitating Bruce Lee. The kind of stupid shit people do while alone. Unfortunately my (white) housemate had returned early as well and had been sitting in the next room listening to me.

She had always taken a disliking to me, for no reason describing me as “conniving” and warning others to be careful around me. We had a very frosty relationship. She informed me that she was going to report me for being racist to the university authorities, and that she had recorded me. I believe she was serious and I could not persuade her otherwise.

To preempt this, I reported her first to the student officer in the accommodation. I said she had developed an unhealthy obsession with me, took videos of me on a regular basis without permission, and upon requesting her to stop she had uttered a common racial trope (I can legitimately claim Jewish ethnicity). I felt I had no other choice to protect myself against her false accusations.

The matter was escalated and she denied the accusation, making the counter accusation of my kitchen performance. Fortunately her recording was was just of me making silly noises while chopping and counted against her, as was evidence of her obsession.

She ended up being forced to move to a different flat and (her choice) did not complete that year of study, returning after summer to do so. She was reprimanded while I was not. She appealed and escalated the matter but again the ruling was in my favour.

As a result, two of my other flat mates requested they be moved from the accommodation. They also repeated the claims online about me my flat mate made - that had been disproven the the university board. They genuinely believed I was the asshole here!

I excitedly told my parents how now I can finally get the dog I wanted and I had an appointment with the shelter next week.

Then my mom goes, ""Looks like your new puppy is going to have a sister!""

I literally freaked out a little thinking my mother was having another kid.

Instead, I found out that they'd reserved a puppy with a breeder and were going to pick her up in a month.

When I tell you I lost my shit, I mean it. I went full exorcist and was screaming at them like a mad woman.

Like every resentment I had just erupted and I called them some really mean stuff. My parents and I were in tears by the end of it.

I've refused to talk to them since.

Yesterday, I got a text from my 13 year old calling me a bitch because my parents were cancelling the puppy reservation.

I then sent them a message in the family WhatsApp group saying that if their goal was to completely exclude me from the family then congratulations, they've succeeded.

I then left the group and blocked my parents.

709,ESH,AITA since I was displeased with my birthday gift?,"Hey Reddit, I'm having a bit of a crises at the moment hahaha.

It was my birthday recently, turned 16 so it was one of the big ones. In the weeks leading up, my mum was asking me ""subtly"" about things I would want. ""Your phone's a bit outdated... are you thinking of upgrading?"", ""I think your earrings are a bit old, how about some new ones?"". You know, mum stuff.

The thing is, I expressed my distaste for the above two suggestions. I said to her very plainly and very flatly, ""I like my phone. The new ones are too bulky and are essentially the same."", as well as literally LAUGHING when she suggested jewellery. ""I never wear jewellery. I only wear these sleepers (earrings) because you gave them to me when I was 2."" Instead of the gifts, I suggested she just give me money like every other year. I had my eye on this jersey I wanted and I didn't have enough money to buy it yet, so I was REALLY hoping for money. I even told my mum this.

My birthday rolls around and I'm opening gifts and, shockingly, the iPhone11 and a $300 necklace with my initial are on the table. I would be lying if I said I wasn't upset, maybe even a little mad. I explicitly denied these gifts because I knew I would dislike them and I knew that the jewellery would not be used. I said thank you, I didn't have a tantrum. I just feel like my own wishes were disregarded and, for MY BIRTHDAY, I feel like I was ignored. I said to my mum ""Didn't I say that jewellery was off the cards?"" and she rolled her eyes ""You'll grow into it! It's your 16th, you needed something special, and anyways, you need nice jewellery for later in life!"" and I felt like I knew then that she hadn't listened to me at all. They still gave me money, but it wasn't nearly enough to buy my jersey that I really wanted. When I told my mum about this, she got really upset with me, saying that ""These are really nice gifts!"" and that I should be more appreciative of what I got because they cost a lot of money and that ""Other kids don't get anything!"". She hasn't talked about it since then and it's been a little awkward when we see each other.

I feel like I'm being a spoilt brat because these gifts were REALLY EXPENSIVE and they are nice gifts, but I also feel like I wasn't listened to at all, as well as the fact that I will almost certainly never wear the necklace, I cannot stand jewellery and how it feels on me. I use the phone, but I miss my old one a lot. It felt like that, for my birthday, my mum bought gifts that she thought I SHOULD want.

710,ESH,AITA for having a go at my dad for doing too much when he is helping me?,"I (25f) recently bought a house and am pretty much stripping it back to the walls and floors and completely redoing it. It's about a 10 minute drive from my parents where I'm living until it's finished. I really enjoy doing DIY and am really looking forward to taking everything apart and working on it with my parents and we've all taken next week off to do it. 

My dad decided to also take this week off because he has a lot of holiday that he can't carry over so he needs to use it. There were some fitted wardrobes that had mirrored doors and were too big to fit in the car and my retired neighbour has a special drill to cut through glass so I asked my dad if they would be able to take those and get rid of them. That was fine and they did that yesterday.

The chimney was also blocked up in quite a shoddy way but I haven't decided if I want a real fire and so will need it unblocked which I had said to him. He pointed it out to my neighbour who said he could build a nicer block that I could leave or rip out depending so they are going back today. 

Now my dad keeps saying he will start ripping up the carpet and taking wallpaper off. I've asked him not to at least 5 times but he keeps bringing it up an hour or 2 later as if he's doing me a favour. The last time he said it I said 'it's my house, I want to do it. Why is that so hard to understand?' and he rolled his eyes and said I'll be glad that he's done it because I won't enjoy it and don't realise how much work it will be. I shouted at him that I want to work hard and I don't care and he just stormed out.

If he says it again today I'm planning on just taking the keys from him and saying I'll get a carpenter in. I feel like I'm being really ungrateful because him and our neighbour have been really helpful and are trying to help but it's my house and I want to enjoy all these things. There's also no rush because my plasterer can't come till January and I'm not planning on moving in till I'm back in the office.",2020-11-26 08:49:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k1bry2/aita_for_having_a_go_at_my_dad_for_doing_too_much/,27,24,0.93,0
711,ESH,AITA - Boyfriend chose weed over an anniversary gift.,"Me (19F) and my boyfriend (21M) have been together a year on the 30th. It's not long I know, but he lives in a little village and doesnt have a job. Hes 21. I live in the city and had a job but have been on furlough since march. I'm 19. I've spent the last 8 months creating a scrapbook and a little box of his favorite items and things that he'll like and I know he hasn't gotten me anything yet. Hasn't even thought of it. He doesnt have any money but I told him he could just get me a card or make me something personal. I'm not materialistic at all but it would be nice to get something in return for a project that took 8 months to complete. His grandma gave him £10 this week when I was next to him and he told me hes get me a card and a little something, even if it was cheap. I was more than okay with that. Half an hour later he told me hed be back in ten minutes. He spent the £10 on weed. When I called him out on it he said that hed borrow some money from his grandma or mum to get me a card but that just makes me feel like shit because it's not from him and it, and I, wasnt really his first choice. Weed was. I know technically the £10 wasnt from him either but everytime I mention going on universal credit or jobseekers he just shrugs it off. He is looking for a job, but it seems half assed.

712,ESH,"AITA for Telling My Wife to ""Shut her F***ing Mouth""","I (28M) usually sit when I go and pee, so the other day while I was squeezing the lemon, I was a little off my game, and made a little it of a mess on the side of the toilet.

&#x200B;

Once I was done, I went to go and clean it up, but my wife (27F)  was there and she asked ""Why are you getting cleaning supplies?."" I kind of didn't want to answer and said "" I'm just cleaning something up, don't worry about it, babe."" She pressed on though and asked what it was that I was trying to clean up, but I REALLY did not want to answer, and just tried to blow her question off and just said ""oh nah don't worry it's not a big deal just gotta wipe something up."" She kind of shrugs  and I go off and start to clean, but once I start, I notice her over my shoulder. I look up and she's giggling and asked if I made a mess, with a kind of condescending baby voice, and I just kind of awkwardly laugh and say that I kind of missed and was just embarrassed to tell her. She kind of laughs and walks off and I don't really think anything of it.

The next week or so she just REALLY does not let it go. Every chance she gets she makes some remark about pee and missing and needing diapers, and just goes on with this kind of annoying baby voice. She does it any chance she gets and I really start getting annoyed after a bit. Even when we talk about something mundane, she feels the need to make a joke and I don't want to tell her to stop because we joke around a lot, but it is honestly getting annoying and I have to pretend it doesn't bother me. It makes me feel like a bit of a child and that she isn't taking me seriously. One day my mom calls just to see how I'm doing and we are just having the routine ""mom call"" kind of conversation. The conversation ends up being about something in my childhood, and my wife overhears and runs in with the baby voice and says ""OOOhhhhh baby PeePeeThroeaway made a messy wessy in the bathroom the other night."" I just kind of lose it at this point after having to deal with it for a few weeks and just shout ""SHUT YOUR F\*\*\*ING MOUTH WITH THIS SH\*T ALREADY"". As expected it just kind of gets awkwardly silent, and my mom says she would call me back another time.

&#x200B;

That night we don't really speak and I feel kind of guilty about yelling at her. I feel like I should apologize, but also she just wouldn't let this go even when she could tell it was making me a little bit uncomfortable.  AITA for yelling at her to shut her mouth?

713,ESH,AITA For Hubby’s (M35) birthday I (F24) planned a surprised dinner and didn’t invite his mom (65) who will invite his ex wife (F35),"I coordinated the Resturant, paid for food and drinks but didn’t handle the guest list. I had everyone one wear his favorite color and it was outside in the most beautiful setting. I messaged his dad in FB messaged asking for help and he said “I’ll take care of the guest”. I don’t personally know his extended family to easily organize this.

His mom is best friends with HCMB who is polite to my face but rude and racist to me other wise (see previous post). For the most part she knows time and place so she wouldn’t say anything outwardly racist with so many people around. Something more so like “I’m so happy to be here with family because all of the Black people conversations are getting tiring”. She’s said that before amongst other things and it really only makes me uncomfortable because I’m the only Black person in a family. She always finds ways to sneak in comments that apparently no one is either bothered by or cares to comment on, if not chucking alongside here.

Anyways, his mom ALWAYS wants BM involved. I guess I didn’t want to deal with it and was selfish for that. So I just left it up to his dad (they’re divorced). I also know that his parents don’t get along.

He says that his mom is the one that raised him and it was fu**ed up. As soon as I got in the car he began driving erratically and calling me selfish and a narcissist. I know I have selfish tendencies sometimes but I didn’t think this was one. I surprised him with breakfast, a haircut, spa day , a football jersey and a few other gifts. I thought about him in all of this.

714,ESH,AITA for going off on my(27M) sister(32F) when she criticized me for having a baby out of infidelity?,"I have a a two year old baby girl who is my life right now. She was conceived out of wedlock and after I had an affair while with my then fiancée. I got the girl pregnant and kept this secret until a few weeks before the my daughter was born. Once she found out my then fiancee dumped me of course. I was going through some things at the time so the girl I cheated with wasn’t much of a class act. She ended up in jail about 7 months later and will be there for a very long time for child endangerment and cocaine possession. Luckily my daughter is only in my hands now.

My daughter being a result of my sleeping around is kinda like the elephant in the room. Most of us never talk about it because frankly it’s embarrassing for me, and I’m not sure if I ever want her to know how she was made. I say most people because my big sister loves to bring up how awful I am. She got divorced from her high school sweetheart 5 years ago because he cheated on her multiple times. She’s bitter and is now taking it out on me and my daughter. 2 Sundays ago, we had a family dinner with her kids, my daughter, our parents and our younger sister.

Before dinner we were chilling in our living room, after talking for a while about how we want our kids to grow up, she said,”Well let’s hope your daughter grows up more like your girlfriend than her mommy or daddy.” I asked what was wrong with me, and she said that my daughter was gonna have tons of men that want her someday, so she needs to learn to not run around on her partners, and obviously I can’t teach her that. I was offended but I let this slide, because she likes to say stupid things like this a lot. 

When we finally sat down to eat she was still cracking jokes at my expense. The final straw was when she told my girlfriend that, if we get engaged, she’d “better get ready for another baby because Mr. Manwh*re over there might wanna slip into another druggie behind another fiancées back”. I was incredibly pissed off. My girlfriend hates hearing about this, and I don’t like her having to think about how much I messed up two years ago. I also feel like it implies that I am ashamed to have my daughter from that situation which I am not. I told her she needed to stop acting like a b&tch. She told me she would if I learned to keep it in my pants. This escalated into yelling fight over dinner, eventually I got fed up with this and decided to leave with my party. While getting up my mom told me I was acting immature and needed to start thinking like an adult and not argue with my sister.

This set me off even more and I left without saying a word to my family. Since that night I’ve gotten calls and messages saying I needed to give an apology and I have refused every time. My girlfriend says I reacted to harshly but she understood where I came from. I haven’t talked to my sister since.

AITA?

Edit Okay I left this out, but at a point in my life, before me and my current GF got together, I may have been a serial cheater. I have cheated on every girlfriend or partner I’ve been with, except my girlfriend, at least once. I had some severe self worth problems and emotional issues. I fucked up, and I hate to say this but I didn’t learn my lesson until I cheated on two other girls between my ex fiancée and current girlfriend.

715,ESH,AITA For not wanting to raise a kid that isn't mine?,"My girlfriend became pregnant 7 years ago. It wasn't planned. I didn't want to be a dad, but did the right thing and married her. She gave birth to a girl who is now 6. I tried to be a good father, bought her toys and shit. But things changed back in April when I found out that around the time my wife became pregnant, she was fucking around with a lot of guys and the kid may not even be mine. 

&#x200B;

I got a dna test done and turns out I'm not the father. My soon to be ex and I are in the process of getting a divorce. As soon as I found out about the kid not being mine I told my wife  to take her kid and get teh fuck out of my house. She went to live with her mother. When they were leaving, I didn't let the kid take any of the toys and stuff I had bought for her. I paid for them and she's not even my kid. My wife called me every name in the book but I stood my ground. 

Yesterday was the kid's birthday. My soon to be ex wife called me and told me I needed to be there for her birthday party. I told her to go fuck herself. I wasn't wasting anymore time and money for a kid that isn't even mine. She berated me for abandoning ""my daughter"" and how she's been crying for her ""father"". I told her to take the kid to her real father, whoever the fuck he is. 

&#x200B;

Now my brother got to know about this and chewed me out. He said I was  being a dick and I should have at least shown up for the kid's birthday party.

716,ESH,AITA for calling out a girl who was acting like a hoe during dinner at a restaurant?,"I (21f) don't make friends all that easy. I'm picky about who I want to hangout with because I believe you really need to vibe to be friends. That said, I'm not a normally mean person, just selective who I really let in to my life. My bf (22m) knows this and asked if I wanted to go to dinner with a few of his military buddies. We are both in the army so this would be a great way for me to make some friends since I tend to vibe pretty well with other military people.

Anyway, so we go to this dinner at a family restaurant and there's 3 other guys and an air force girl. I shit you not when I say she was acting like a hoe all night and immediately didn't like her. Some examples of her behavior:

1. Calls her 2 yr kid a ""crotch goblin"" and brags that she ""pawns him off"" to her mother because she hates how much he cries 

2. Mentioned loudly and several times that she's slept with 2 of the guys also eating dinner. Also VERY in depth description of said sexual encounters.

3. Told my bf that she was going to steal me from him and showed me a picture of her breasts.

4.asked my bf if he would eat her ass later, winked, and slipped him her number

There's more but for the sake of the post, I'll stop there. So at one point, one of the guys was showing us a picture of a guys dick that had been bitten by a snake (he's fine now). As a medic, I really wanted to see purely out of curiosity. She kept trying to get him to put the phone away and making a big deal about how we were in a public restaurant and it wasn't appropriate. I had had too many drinks at this point and finally snapped and said something like ""why tf are suddenly concerned about you're public image? You've been acting like a hoe ALL night and OBVIOUSLY you've seen plenty of dick. Can't handle one more?""

She got pissed off, left in a huff after throwing water in my food, and called me a bitch. The guys all laughed and said she had it coming but I feel kinda bad. AITA?

ETA: forgot to mention she kept grabbing one of the guys dicks after he said no and had JUST had his fiancee of 5yrs leave him for a friend.

ETA: I apologize for not making it clear, but the rest of the group tried to politely get her to stop several times (both groping and comments). We were actually all being fairly respectful but she really took it to another level. Also none of us were drunk, just having a few drinks with our meal.",2020-08-25 11:56:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/igaoox/aita_for_calling_out_a_girl_who_was_acting_like_a/,523,5351,0.92,10
717,ESH,AITA for telling my sister in law not to buy a gay onesie for our baby before I checked with my husband?,"My sister in law is bi and my husband and I are expecting a baby. She was at Target and they had some gay pride merch up. We were on the phone while she was shopping. She said that she had found a $15 pouch that she had loved, but that she didn’t have the money for it. She has been in a really bad financial situation for quite a while now, and normally I’m the one she comes to when she needs some $ to get by until she gets paid. Anyways, a few minutes later, she found an onesie that had a rainbow on it and had “we’re all family” written on it. She said that she was going to buy it for the baby

Here’s the thing, my husband and I had already talked about how we would introduce the subject to our kid. We want our kid to be raised seeing that love is love and that his aunt and great-uncle (my husband’s uncle has been married to his husband for over 10 years) have the same kind of relationships and share the same love as we do. pretty much we dont want our kid to think differently about gay relationships. 

Also, my husband and I, even though we go out to gay bars with my SIL during pride week (actually not only during pride week lol) we have never worn any shirts or dressed up. So, since I knew that my SIL was really struggling with $$, I felt bad letting her buy the $5 onesie bc I didn’t know if my husband would be ok or not with the baby wearing it. So I told her to let me check with her brother (my husband) first before she bought it. 

That was all it took for her to REALLY upset. She started crying on the phone with me and started saying stuff like “you understand that your baby’s aunt is gay, right?!” And asked me if she was going to be able to have her gfs around the baby. Which, she knows that she obviously would! 
However, things escalated on her end and she said that she knew her brother wouldn’t have an issue with the onesie and that she thought that I was having an issue with the onesie and being homophobic. She said that she was shocked that I wouldn’t allow the baby to wear it and that she was really hurt but that now she saw how I really felt. Which, again, is crazy as she knows me and knows that some of my closest friends are gays. And at no point did I say anything about the baby not being allowed to wear it, I just wanted to make sure my husband wouldn’t oppose to it. That’s literally what I said.

I obviously felt horrible about the whole situation and if I had known that she would get so hurt I wouldn’t have said anything. But I did feel bad at the moment letting her spend her money on something I knew the baby might never wear. Anyways, I did bring the onesie up to my husband and he veto it (!!) So now she thinks I’m homophobic and has no idea that her brother was the one who didn’t really want the onesie. I feel like if I were to tell her that, she would get even more upset. 
She is known in the family for being dramatic and over sensitive, but we were REALLY close and I never would have thought things would get to this point.",2020-11-20 05:46:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jxjkoq/aita_for_telling_my_sister_in_law_not_to_buy_a/,58,16,0.78,0
718,ESH,AITA for disrespecting Japanese 'culture' by wearing shoes?,"I'm a young professional living in a major city in the U.S., and I live in a group home with 5 other 20-somethings. Our house is an old, four-story row home that was built in the 1920s, and although we keep it neat and clean, some parts of the house are just a little worn down from being a group home for so long. For example, the first floor of the house is all wood flooring, and although we sweep and vacuum it regularly, it is a bit dirty from the accumulate years of footsteps. 

One of my new roommates is a very close friend of mine from college who just moved to our city after living and working in Japan for almost 5 years. He's been a kind and considerate roommate, and I love spending time with him. However, he recently told me that he's planning on asking everyone in the house to take off their shoes in the entryway, since it really bothers him when people wear shoes inside. He talked about how, in Japan, everyone takes their shoes off before entering a house and puts on slippers, so as to keep the floor clean. While I want to be respectful of his wants and needs as a housemate, I am absolutely unwilling to take off my shoes EVERY time I enter the house. I also don't own a pair of ""house slippers"" like he does, and I frankly do not want to spend money on some. Our entryway is also very narrow, and it's already getting clutter by all of HIS shoes that he takes off before coming inside, so I don't think it's feasible for all 6 of us to take off our shoes. 

More than that, he suggested that we all deep clean the flooring on the first floor of the house, which would definitely require a ton of work and potentially paying a professional. He says that the dirty floor also really bothers him, and wants it to be clean so his house slippers don't get dirty. I am also unwilling to do this, since I already do the majority of sweeping, vacuuming, and cleaning up, so I do not want to have to scrub the floors in addition to the housework I already do. 

I told him that I didn't think it was practical to force everyone in the house to take off their shoes, and that he was asking a bit too much for someone who had just moved in. He told me that I was being inconsiderate of his needs and his Japanese 'culture' (he is white and was born in Oregon). He hasn't told our other roommates about this plan yet, but I really don't want to be the bad guy in this situation. On one hand, it wouldn't be THAT difficult for me to take off my shoes before coming inside, especially if this is something that really bothers him, but on the other hand, I feel like he's making demands of the rest of us and isn't willing to give any ground himself, even though this is a 6 person house and we all need to compromise. I feel like I'm being extremely petty about this issue and would love some feedback.

Yesterday, my ex wife starts ringing the doorbell 5 times in succession. I look at my phone and see a bunch of texts saying she was done with my daughter (14)’s attitude and needed to be away from her.

My new wife (34) is currently pregnant and her sisters are staying over at our home. I already had my week with my daughter at the start of September where she lived at the house.

My wife doesn’t want to deal with her stepdaughter right now because she’s pregnant and just wants to hang out with her friends and sisters in peace. Especially because she says she feels my daughter giving her stink eyes.

My ex wife kept on ringing the doorbell and my daughter texted saying she wanted to stay with me for a while. 

However, I refused to open the door because legally this wasn’t my one week a month and my wife and her sisters want to drive up an hour up to Hilton Head to do shopping and have a mini staycation.

We can’t do that with a 14 year old around and they’ve been planning this for a while now.

We have a good middle class income however my wife has extremely high student loans that we are trying to pay off within 5 years. We pool our money together and we each get a personal account for clothing, drinks/food with friends, hobbies etc. As a side note, my wife is frequently at a balance of $0 in that account as she spends it all. We roughly get $2k-$3k/year each for this.

We had originally planned a vacation in December that we are canceling due to the pandemic and have an ""extra"" $2k to use. I'd like to save the money or put it towards the student loans but since my wife had some recent accomplishments I thought it would be a good idea if we took half the money and got ourselves something nice. 

My wife is obsessed with Christmas and came to me and suggested we get a prelit family christmas tree. I don't care for holidays at all, and despite being annoyed that the idea isn't really something for the both of us, I asked her the price. $2k?!?!

I can't for the life of me remember the last time we have been on a date. I don't remember her initiating anything. In the last year or so it’s like she is avoiding going out in general. And no, before anyone asks, she is not cheating, she just ""likes to work"" -\_-.

When covid happened, we had to stay at home and all, I thought this was a good opportunity for a house date. Nope. from 9am to 1am, work and sleep the rest. It did not help that on weekends or any breaks she took, she literally spent the whole day sleeping. She was mostly finished with her work and was taking up more work because it paid and that her coworkers or juniors messed stuff up and asked for her help. Every plan I made ends up coming second to work. This has been the source of regular arguments now and she promises to make it up but never does.

Last week, it was our 5th wedding anniversary and for me that was a big deal for me. I planned one month before for this day. since the covid restrictions were easing up in my area, I reserved a rather expensive restaurant and bought a platinum necklace for her. We were to meet at the house and leave at around 7pm for the 9pm reservation (restaurant was half an hour away but i wanted to visit the aquarium near the hotel.) At near 7 when she was a no show, I called her and she told me there was trouble at work because of her junior and she HAD to take over. I did not respond and just cut the call.

I met her sister 25F outside who lives with her parents, my in laws, a few streets away. She could tell I was pissed off and I gave her the cliff note version and she was just empathetic. I don't know why but I asked her if she wanted to go to that restaurant because I still had time to make the reservation. She accepted and even in laws had no problem (she is my little sis in a way). We made the reservation, had a nice chat and meal. I had the gift in my pocket and I decided to give that to wife’s sister who refused at first but I still insisted her to take it as an early birthday present and dropped her off home.

It blew up the next day when wife found out how I spent our anniversary and made a scene Infront of in-laws. That I betrayed her and my actions were disgusting, predatory to name a few. What pissed her off more was the gift I had given to her sister and now demanded I apologize by getting her a new necklace as such or sister give the one, I got for her initially. Here is where I was the AH by saying that I don’t get gifts for roommates, that maybe if you acted more like a wife than a roommate, I would consider. Even in laws took my side on this one and asked us to arrange another date this weekend. I refused and told her wife has to now.

Wife got angry and went to stay at a hotel. AITA here ?

723,ESH,AITA for Causing Someone to Lose their Salututorian Position?,"**\*Important Update at End\***

Background: The school she (17F) goes to is the same one I (18F) attended before I left for college. Our school does as many valedictorians as 4.0's, but usually 1-2 salutatorians.

I graduated as a Valedictorian with a full ride to a Top 20 school (not trying to brag, just setting the stage). Because of this, a lot of people have come to me for homework and assignment help. I review/critique essays for $5 but usually don't write them. A senior DM's me one day and says, ""Hey, I know you're really good with Essays, and I'm so stressed that I don't think I'm going to be able to write my final paper for Dual English."" (it's an English class taken in partnership with a local college for college credit once she graduates) I ask her to explain to me what's going on and she says she's been so stressed with work and her other classes and trying to keep her GPA up that she doesn't have time.

I ask her how long the essay is and she says it's a minimum of 6 pages. I've done longer, so I'm not too worried. I tell her that finals and my own papers are coming up so I can get it done but it might take me a week or two. She says, ""it's due in three days."" I am blunt and tell her, ""If you want me to write it in three days, you're gonna have to pay me."" She's down and we agree on $30, to be sent once I tell her (and send the first paragraph as proof) I have finished.

I spend about five hours on this essay. I tell her I have finished it and she says, ""I know it's not due until tomorrow but I get extra-credit if I turn it in tonight."" I tell her that's fine as long as she pays me. She then says, ""I don't get paid until tomorrow. I promise I'll send the money then.""  I ask if she can do a down-payment of $10. She says yes and does. So, I send her the essay. She tells me to remind her the next day just in case she forgets.

I remind her. She leaves me on read. I remind her again, and she says, ""I didn't get paid as much as I would like to. I'll pay you next week."" I argue with her and tell her that isn't the agreement. She removes me from her followers list (not blocking).

So, I email her professor and tell him I wrote her final essay for her.

I get another message from her the next day, and she says he gave her a zero for the final and she'll end up with a C in the course without it, causing her to lose her salutatorian status she ""worked so hard for"". I told her she should've thought about that before pulling what she did. My friends are mixed about it, but some of them are friends with her inner circle. AITA?

Update: No one asked, but I figured some honesty was necessary. A few weeks ago, I saw a post on my main account about a girl who made up a story for research purposes for a class. While I did not make this story up, it was not me it came from. I am actually a current junior on my University's honor council. This semester, we were coursed with coming up with more appropriate punishments for violations based on three factors: how the general public would view our school after, the behavior of the student after confrontation, and the severity of the violation. 

This particular case is from the 2017 school year, and the girl who committed the violation is now a senior after receiving a warning her freshman year, along with a requirement to complete an academic honesty training course. Her attitude throughout the process was deemed as ""haughty and falsely superior"". I tried responding to comments in ways that reflected that and in ways that reflected someone more conscious of their moral misjudgment. The responses I received from those two behaviors cary greatly. 

For those who commented and I replied to, I am deeply sorry if my logic came off as harsh. It is hard to come up with an argument for something you disagree on. Our final meeting is Friday, and I am excited to share (anonymously) the opinions you have provided.

724,ESH,AITA for being upset that my parents tore apart my room?,"This just happened, so I’ll do my best to describe it. My parents have been fixing some things in the kids bathroom, which is right next to my room upstairs. In my bedroom closet, there’s a panel that allows access to the plumbing of the shower.

I (17F) have been in online classes all day. After my last class, my iPad died, so I went upstairs to grab my charger and found my room absolutely ransacked. 

I’ll admit, my room has never been the cleanest. It probably hasn’t ever been fully clean. Before corona, my schedule was absolutely insane, and during corona, my mental health has plummeted. My parents have consistently been on me for years now to clean my room. I’ll get sudden bursts of motivation, get halfway there, and then everything piles up again. 

The room is a mess, but I always know where everything is. It’s organized chaos, in a way. To make it clear: this is not the way I want to live, but my bedroom isn’t really my top priority right now, as I’m in the college application process.

They very clearly did not take any care when moving my things off the floor. Things are all over my bed, all around my bed, and I have no idea where anything is now.

What I’m really upset about is the fact that they didn’t even tell me. I had to find out for myself. I know it’s not huge in the grand scheme of things, but my room is the only personal space I have. Walking in to find it like that was a huge shock and felt like an invasion of my privacy. I told my parents this much, but they say if my room had been clean (read: if my sh*t had been picked up) this wouldn’t have been an issue to begin with, and that I don’t have any personal space as the house belongs to them. Their argument is that they had to do it to reach the panel in the closet for the plumbing, and maybe now that my stuff is on my bed I’ll finally put it away. I think I may be the asshole because my room wasn’t clean enough for them to reach the panel, despite them telling me to clean it constantly.

I really would have just appreciated a heads up.

726,ESH,AITA for insisting that my daughter has her own room?,"There are 6 kids total in my wife and I's house: 15m, 14f (twins), 11f, 3m, and now 1mo m. My wife and I got together 4 years ago, had an unplanned pregnancy with 3m early on, and have been living together since. 11f is my daughter from a previous reationship. 

The house is a 4 bedroom, but one bedroom is just a loft on the 4th floor and another bedroom is so small that it would only be okay for one person, even if they were a child. 

The loft has a bathroom, the two good-sized bedrooms have ensuite bathrooms, but the small 4th bedroom would have to go into someone else's room for a bathroom. 15m and the twins are very close to each other, but have never gotten along with 11f. The oldest 3 ganged up on 11f at the slightest issue, and had no problem excluding her regardless of anything we tried to do. Even now, they will manipulate 3m into ignoring 11f by making it subtly clear that giving 11f attention leads to them excluding 3m. 

When we first moved in together, we tried all of the girls together in the loft, but the fighting was so bad that we put 15m and the twins together in the loft, gave 11f one of the bedrooms, and used the small room as the nursery. Now we have another baby, and the small room isn't big enough for two. We need to move rooms around again.  

My wife wants to put the youngest two in 11f's old room, put 15m in the small room and make the loft the girls' room. I know that the babies need more space and that someone is losing something, but I think 11f needs to maintain her own room, even if she would have to walk through what would be the new nursery for a bathroom. She deserves her own space because she is unfortunately more alienated than she should be and deals with more conflict. 

My wife is adamant that the single bedroom should go to 15m because ""he's way too old to be with the girls"". She won't acknowledge that her kids hate 11f and says they all just need to ""deal with it and get over it"". She was an only child so she just doesn't understand what sibling relationships are or that her oldest 3 are unnaturally close even for that. Even besides that, if 15m got the small room, he would still have to use the loft bathroom due to his height, which could lead to problems. 

It's at a stalemate right now but something needs to happen soon.",2020-10-05 16:13:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/j5mb01/aita_for_insisting_that_my_daughter_has_her_own/,228,232,0.92,0
727,ESH,AITA for wanting to be in charge of my own finances?,"I’m a 23 year old autistic woman. Five years ago I went to university and had a lot of money (student loans) for the first time in my life. I went a bit crazy and ended up in debt of about £1000. My mum had to pay it off.

I left university after a year and a half because I wasn’t coping mentally. At that point it was decided that there would be two bank accounts- one my money went into it and that I couldn’t access and one that I could access. Every week my dad would take some money from the first account snd put it in my account.

This system worked and once I proved I could manage weekly it moved to a monthly amount of money, this time handled by my mum. At this point I was back at uni and had student loans again. My mum was saving some of the loans because we weren’t sure I’d get full funding for my final year. 

As it turns out we did. So I was left with £5000 in a bank account I cannot touch. My sister and I decided to go on a celebratory trip to disney world and universal studios and mum agreed to let me use my £5000 to pay for it. That was last year.

The pandemic means I am at home living with my mum and currently jobless. I graduated university but have struggled to find work. I get £342 a month in unemployment. 

My sister and I have had to rearrange our holiday twice. This is made extra complicated because I don’t know how much money is in my account and I’m not allowed to make any decisions using that money without asking my mum first. 

I got fed up of this and said to my mum that I am an adult who should be allowed to do what she likes with her money and not have to go through my mother. It is my money and I am the only one who gets a say in what I do with it.

I said I’d be willing to sit down and sort out a proper budget and everything but mum blew up at me. Said she’s had to bail me out before and she’s not doing it again and that she thinks I’ll spend it all and need bailing out again etc.

The thing is, my older brother (now 30) has always been terrible with money. Mum bailed him out for almost a decade; she must have given him over £10,000 over the years. She never once tried to control my money like she does mine.

So I can’t help but feel like I must have missed something that explains why she’s treating me so differently.

729,ESH,AITA for refusing to pay for my daughter’s college?,"My daughter Abby (17F) is a senior in HS, and is applying to college for next Fall. She has been working hard, has a lot of extra curriculars, but not the best grades. We live in a small town, and she has expressed that she wants to go to college in a big city, across the country. 

We (my wife and I) had always made it clear to her that should she decide to go to college, she’d have to find a way to finance it on her own, and encouraged her to get her grades up to get a scholarship. However, that hasn’t really come to pass, and it turns out, her options for funding are quite limited if she does want to go to a reputable place. 

My uncle passed away earlier this year, and left a sizable inheritance for me and my siblings. I hadn’t mentioned it to Abby, but she found out through her mother recently. She was absolutely ecstatic because it meant we could afford to pay for her college, and “it would increase [her] chances to get in to so many places”. 

I told her that the deal is still the same. She needs to find a way to pay for her education, and apply to places that would make financing it easier. She blew up and has been extremely upset since. Her mother is very sympathetic towards her (encouraging this behavior, even), and says I’m being unreasonable. 

Abby hasn’t been out of her room much since the conversation and has refused to look at me. I think she is being childish and entitled, while she is accusing me of “clipping her wings”.

730,ESH,AITA for walking out on cleanup after dinner?,"We are having Thanksgiving at my grandparents as we have my entire life. This is the first one celebrating with my family with my Fiancé, as a separate party from my parents, and we brought dessert and wine.

As long as we’ve done this, we’ve always served buffet style, cleaned our own plates and helped wrap up dinner as a group. 

I’ve always gone out of the way to help, whether its set up, getting drinks, bringing out food. Whatever it is, I’ve always made myself available.

For some reason, this year my grandfather decided to hand out “assignments” during dinner, singling out my sisters boyfriend and young cousin. He specifically said “you need to clean the plates, stack them, rinse them, and put them away.” Keep in mind, this is extremely odd, theres never been problems with cleanup. I’ve always done this, and everyone is very respectful. Sisters BF joked that he guessed he was still a pledge here, and thats honestly how it felt.

My uncle apparently had a problem that his son was asked to do this and complained, why cant OP and his sister do it? So my grandpa decided its now our job to clean their table. 

Initially, I brushed this off, it was out of character and I was a little offended he felt the need to assign us their table to clean. I suppose I felt this way because it’s something I’ve always done on my own terms, and my uncles complaining irked me. So I went about dinner, helped stack our plates and let my cousin take them to the sink. Grandpa comes in ask condescendingly says “Ok, group two, we’re ready.” Odd.

I walked in to help, and the everyone is up from the table set around the room ready to watch us clean their stuff up. Stuff strewn around the table, nothing stacked, almost felt purposefully cumbersome. My grandpa even made a comment “here he is, this is who i really wanted to see clean up.” It’s as if I’ve been completely invisible to this man my entire life. It felt like everything else I’d done around didn’t matter. I looked around, said this was stupid and walked out. My grandfather had some choice words “oh well hes not my son, everyone needs to contribute” all that bs. 

It felt oddly derogatory cleaning up that way. As i type it out, it seems like no big deal, but I was furious, and embarrassed.

731,ESH,AITA for eating scrambled eggs toastless?,"English isn’t my first language. 

I am staying at a friend’s (Thiago) house for the next two weeks. It was a rather unexpected thing, but my friend’s family are chill, and now I am in their house.

Today was the first breakfast, and Thiago’s mom made a lot of food, of which scrambled eggs was included. I get a helping of scrambled eggs, and the mom asks me if I would like toast. So I ask her for what, since I’m eating eggs.

“For the eggs.”

What.

So I go, no, eggs do not belong in toast. Eggs are to be eaten in their pure eggy form. The only exception is boiled eggs. That is for toast. Thiago overhears me, and he goes no, you can put them on toast. Seriously.

I am not eating scrambled eggs on toast. His sister (Maria) is now annoyed, and she asks me if I am trying to be funny, by pretending that I don’t eat scrambled eggs on toast, and I explain, again, that this is an awful idea, and that they can all do it however they want, I am not desecrating eggs like that.

Thiago for some reason is finding it funny, and he asks me if I have ever noticed that nearly everyone else eats scrambled eggs on toast, and that in this situation, I am actually the odd one out. 

This is confusing and distressing information, and I‘m like “WHY.” No one in my house does it. We all eat eggs without toast. Boiled eggs go on toast. Nothing else. (I also realise now that sometimes people add butter which ??? WHY.) 

For the most part, this is still light-hearted, but Maria gets annoyed, and demands I eat eggs properly, and I’m not doing that, because it is going to be a sensory hell, and I respect eggs. Maria now thinks I am lying about not knowing that, and the more I explain that I am completely serious. The more confused I get as to why eggs belong on toast, the harder Thiago, his parents and brother laugh, and the more annoyed Maria gets and tries to convince me I must’ve known.


Maria is now super pissed, and I’m no longer doing hot, because she is yelling, and Thiago intervenes with a “Leave them alone, they’re weird, wait until you see how they eat salads,” and Maria leaves (without having breakfast), after insulting me.*

Maria clearly thinks I am an asshole for how I eat eggs, so reddit, AITA for everything that happened? Should I just have shut up?

This is a bit of an... uncomfortable one. Sorry to anyone if this is a bit gross (number twos). She won’t talk to me and it’s been a day since it happened.

My (23M) girlfriend (24F) and I are both on low FODMAP diets, basically, we can’t eat a variety of foods because they upset our insides.

We (mutually) decided that with COVID we would treat ourselves to a night free from restrictions just to break up the drudgery of day to day life with the way things were going and ordered a meal from a delivery app that bore none of our dietary restrictions.

We had a lovely meal and night and went to bed with no issues. Here is the part where I may be the asshole. I wake up in the night and my guts are quaking, I feel vile. I rush to the toilet and lock the door, this is going to be a big one. 

I sit down and to my surprise nothing happens, just chaotic gurgles coming from my belly, so I relax and hope nature will take it’s course. I’m sitting there for what must have been ten minutes. I’m actually on the verge of falling asleep and hear this frantic banging on the door and shouting, well, it scares the shit out of me, all of the pent up nightmare inside me comes out in full force. My frame of consciousness widens from solely the task at hand after the initial wave and I realize my girlfriend is what let the flood gates go loose.

She is shouting through the door saying she really needs to go and can’t hold it any more, I can hear the desperation in her voice and I know she is in the exact same situation as me but I know I don’t have enough time between blasts to even get up and open the door for her to get in and use the sink or the shower and she goes in her pants.

Most of my close friends understand my tics and laugh about them and I also have friends who also have Tourette's. I was hanging out with some friends and one of them brought their neighbor who was new to the area and looking to meet new people.

She had all these misconceptions about tourrettes like that if I tic someone I secretly mean it or sometimes I could just yell swear words for the fun of it, or that I just shouldn't go into restaurants and stuff because of it. Well then I had the \*offensive word\* tic out of literally nowhere. Keep in mind she is not a part of the race it offends.

She kept telling me to apologize and I was like ""to who?"" and she was like ""Everyone"" even though she was the only one who seemed to care. My friends are pretty good at ignoring my tics. I was like ""Why does it bother you? Your not \*certain race\*""

She replied ""Well I have this thing called empathy and I care about other people when you are bullying them?"" Most of my friends stepped in and tried to educate her and also say that I was allowed to say it either way. She wouldn't listen and was insistent that I secretly meant it.

On a regular basis, they let their dog roam unleashed, they don't pick up after their dog, and pretty often flick their cigarette butts (still lit) into our bush.
Lately (for the past 2 weeks or so) my house *reeks* of my other neighbor's cooking. The smell from the food is so strong and so regular that it's now in my clothes. I can't even open my windows because the smell is so overpowering. 

Additionally, I've noticed they've been working out of and storing cooked food in their garage (the garages are detached and in the center of our community). They've been having large units (of what, I don't know.. even if I looked, I would be able to tell. It covered with wood and shrink wrap.) on pallets delivered and whoever drops it off, takes something from their garage. When the truck (a regular pickup) comes by to drop of ""the pallet,"" it's for about 30-40 minutes at a time and blocks either my car port parking spot or my garage. 

Carrying trays of food and transporting whatever they received, they have to pass my door to so. And when it is happening, it's regularly been all day. Like from 10am to maybe midnight. Sifting and putting whatever in a machine that makes a lot of noise. From the backyard to the garage that sits about 100-150 feet from my front door. I bring that up because it's not like I've spied on them. I don't hold a glass up to the wall to hear, I don't hold up a mirror to look. 

Whatever is going on is pungent, is loud, and is something that I consider a nuisance.

I've thought about talking to them, but I don't think that is safe (pandemic and whatnot) to talk to them m, as they have a lot of people that don't live there coming through the house. And I've considered that this might be how they're getting by for now.

I've been fighting with myself about whether or not I should say anything to the HOA property manager. I don't want to cause problems, especially since we are all home *all* day.

Will I be the asshole if I tell him this? I do feel guilty because I'm the one who agreed to get her with him.. the original agreement was to be co-owners.

Edit: Thank you for the honest responses! I realize that I could do better myself. Our cat is a sweet girl, I just need to talk to my husband more strictly about this. I think I'm projecting a lot of my anger towards my husband on her because he used to be abusive and manipulative towards me. Not the cat's fault.

737,ESH,WIBTA if I make it clear I don't like the Thanksgiving guests?,"So, my parents are polyamorous, and I hate it. It wouldn't be so bad, but a swear, they've acted like flanderized characters that only talk about their polyamory ever since they told me and I hate it. Now that's probably an exaggeration, but probably because I'm asexual, it feels accurate. Their only friends are polys like them, and I hate that too. So I went to my mom house for thanksgiving. I expected her ex-boyfriend (basically a baby daddy of my brother) to be there and maybe my brothers, but apparently, there's going to be four more people there (well exceeding the 6 person rule) and they aren't family, they're just hoes. One I've heard countless stories about and he's a huge slut. What doesn't help is every time I mention the people limit (which I admit, bringing it up as much as I do is an asshole move), I get told that two of the people had tested positive before and recovered so they 'are safer to be around'. I didn't know about this until a few days ago, so it's too late to back out now.

I don't hate polyamorous people, I hate my parents being sluts. WIBTA if I don't interact with anybody, or if I do, I seem like I'm not enjoying the conversation enough to get them to leave me alone. I've never met these people, I don't really know anything about them beside's their my parent's hoes. Is that enough reason to justifiably act like an asshole to them? Will I call them hoes and sluts and curse them out to their faces? No, most likely not. Will I give them a tone of voice that might make them think that I'm mentally calling them sluts? Yeah, probably. WIBTA though?",2020-11-26 03:34:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k17iyl/wibta_if_i_make_it_clear_i_dont_like_the/,23,15,0.81,0
738,ESH,WIBTA for telling a highschool friend she's whoring herself out for money,"I have a friend I met in high school youth group. We weren't best friends or anything but we mostly kept in touch during birthdays and holidays through college and then fell out of contact. A while back she reached back out to me through facebook and we chatted a bit. And then she hit me up to try Monat (one of those MLMs). I left her on read hoping that she would get the message and she didn't contact me for a while before going back to birthday and holiday posts. Over the past few months her social media is almost completely about Monat and how she's a boss babe and her business is covering her rent. She recently made a post about how much money people could make if they ""just worked hard enough"" like her.  I can't take her MLM shit anymore.

It would be shitty of me, but I really want to send her a message back about how turned her social media and relationships into a profit pool, how Monat isn't a personality trait, and ask if she feels good about making money off the backs of her friends downline.

This would definitely ruin any remaining friendly feelings towards each other, but would it be an asshole move?

Edit: forgot to add that she messaged me after the ""just work hard enough"" post and pitched it again

Edit 2: whoring was a really bad choice and I shouldn't have use it. I am absolutely an AH for using it. What I was trying to say was that I'm felt hurt that it seem like she's turning what used to be a meaningful relationship into an opportunity to make more money. I hate that she turned into someone who only seems to care about me and my other youth group friends as potential profits.

Last edit: thank you for the replies and judgement. This post is coming from a place of hurt and I was absolutely TA for using the words I did. I'm gonna tell her no to joining, have a good cry about losing a friend, and maybe reach out in a few months to see if we can have a relationship outside of this MLM. Thank you for the kick in the pants, I can see that I have a lot of growing to do if this is my response to a perceived hurt.

740,ESH,AITA for blocking these cars?,"So I was on the highway overtaking a car (in the far right lane in my country), but that thing was happening where the car you're trying to overtake ends up going basically the same speed as you so you're stuck there for ages.
This large car rocks up behind me and starts tailgating me because they want me to speed up so that we can both overtake this other car, but I'm driving a friend's car *plus* I'm on a probationary licence so I'm not willing to risk speeding.
They then flash their headlights at me to try and get me to speed up, but I'm already going a couple k's over and not willing to do any more. A little while goes by and they aggressively flash their lights twice more and continue to tailgate in the hopes I speed up... finally the car I'm trying (and failing) to overtake moves across to the far left lane and is out of the picture. The tailgating car quickly and angrily gets around me and once they're in front of me, they slow down just enough so that my car is uncomfortably close to theirs. This of course prompts me to change lanes and they are finally out of my life.

741,ESH,AITA For not telling the couple I slept with about my genetic disability?,"Let me first ask y'all to leave your kink shaming at the door. I got enough from the first layer I talked to. 

This isn't lewd erotica so I'll keep this simple. I was born with a genetic disability. You can't tell from looking at me but it was very challenging growing up. So much so I vowed to myself never to have children. I bet you can already see where this is going. 

A few years back I met a couple on OkCupid that were looking for a third. They swore to me up and down that the girlfriend was on birth control. We all exchanged recent clean STD results and the rest is an exercise left up to the reader. We meet on and off for a few months until they went no contact. Honestly it happens all the time with couples. No biggie. 

That is until I get a phone call from them back in July demanding that I give them five grand for my daughter's (?!?!?!) special home aid because money is tight now. They muddled through some explanation of how we had an ""oopsie baby"" and the husband doesn't have the gene (if 23andme is to be believed) so it must come from me. I told them there wasn't a chance and blocked them on my cell and social media. Now I'm getting fake one-day-old accounts posting on my wall that I'm a deadbeat dad and some of my supposed friends have responded asking for more information. 

I don't plan to pay up but I wonder if this all could've been avoided if I told them like ""hey just in case I have this shitty recessive gene"" or something idk.

742,ESH,Aita for not taking my dog to the vet when he's hurt?," My husband and I (28f) have a 3 year old husky named Banjo. When Banjo was about 6 months old we came home from work to him limping around and not putting weight on his front left leg. We took him to the vet and he had broken his leg, we aren’t exactly sure how but we think he probably fell down the stairs or something. 

We felt bad for him so we gave him a ton of extra treats and attention while he was in his cast and when he limped around. A few weeks after his cast came off, Banjo had randomly started limping again so we took him back to the vet. The vet told us that he wasn’t injured and that sometimes dogs will fake being hurt especially if they know they get attention and treats from it. Since then, every once and a while when Banjo believes he hasn’t gotten enough attention or treats that day he will start limping around and acting like he’s in pain. We’ve definitely reinforced his behavior because we always give him treats and love whenever he’s ‘hurt’. 

We had my cousin over yesterday and Banjo limps into the living room and dramatically plops onto his bed and sighs loudly. My husband and I laugh because we think his dramatics are funny and we explain it to my cousin. She told me that we need to take him to the vet because he could be hurt. We try to tell her that he does it solely for the attention and he’s definitely not actually in any pain. She tells us that is doesn’t really matter because he might not be faking it one day and could actually be in pain. I tell her that taking him to the vet every time he’s ‘hurt’ would be a waste of time for us and for the vet because there is nothing wrong with him. It’s also $50 per visit to the vet and since he’s ‘hurt’ at least twice a week that’s $5,200 that we are giving the vet for him to tell us Banjo is dramatic. My cousin told us that we ‘shouldn’t own pets if we aren’t willing to properly afford to care for them’ and that the ASPCA should come take Banjo and find him a home that actually cares about him. She ended up storming out telling  us she was going to call the ASPCA on us. Banjo is both my husband and I's first dog so we aren't experts but taking him to the vet that often is ridiculous right.

743,ESH,AITA for telling my ex-girlfriend that my ex-best friend is probably just trying to get in her pants?,"I’m so lost right now. It really sucks losing a girlfriend, especially when I’m the one that broke it off because I wasn’t 100% sure what I wanted and she was practically begging for a ring on her finger. We were together for little over a year and I just don’t think I’m ready for marriage. I’m still trying to finish up school and figure myself out before I’m ready to commit my life to someone like that. But it got to the point where it would negatively effect our relationship. The conversation of being life-time partners started to come up very often and would usually end in tears and tension. I couldn’t let that drag on any longer. I figured it was the best thing for me and for her to end it. But that doesn’t mean it was easy for me. I took it pretty hard and naturally I looked to my friends for support. One friend in particular has been a long time friend. We have been best friends for 8 years. I’ve been through thick and thin with him. Everything from being an emotional support for him through break ups to bailing him out of jail for getting into a physical altercation with a girlfriend (now ex-girlfriend). However, when I needed him, he was nowhere to be found. In the sense that he would take days to text me back. Was always too busy to hang out and kick it like we used to. The worst part was that he had no problem finding the time to hang out with my ex-girlfriend and her friends on the weekends. They would go to bars and participate in activities that we used to all do together. This made me pretty upset. I was furious. I felt like the bro code had been broken in so many ways. Why would he rather spend time with her than with me? There’s not many reasons I can think of... seemed like a classic case of being the nice guy that’s making sure the newly-single and emotionally vulnerable girl has some support (wink,wink). I took it upon myself to tell my ex-girlfriend to tread carefully as he may just be looking to get into her pants. When he found out about this little conversation, it lead to an inevitable texting boxing match, but hey, this is the most he’s talked to me in a while so that’s a positive right? Our friendship at this point is unsalvageable I think. Perhaps it may seem too far of a jump to conclusion to accuse him of trying to get with my ex-girlfriend, but she has complained to me multiple times of him flirting with her while we were still together.

Now I just don't date and honestly, I don't really blame women for not wanting to date my insecure ass since I wouldn't either I cut off contact with him and tried to make everyone else in the family do it too and they agreed. 

I also destroyed any family photos on the internet and off the internet so It was like he never existed at all, I all got a call from his lawyer and he said he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and that he was dying and would like to make amends with everyone he hurt. Especially me, I told the lawyer I'm glad he was dying and he will live with the shitty thing he did for the rest of his life and that I'll never forgive him since he ruined my life. The lawyer gave me the details anyway like I'm going to go and advised that I should consider seeing him anyway 

After this interaction, I told everyone what had happened since I thought they had the right to know and they asked me if I would see him and I said no and that I'm happy he is dying. My mother shouted at me saying that I'm a bitter asshole and that I need to get over it and that he has probably changed and that I was being unfair. My sister said similar things to me but I don't think he deserves closer and the only way I'd go is to let him know that he isn't forgiven they got angrier and said I was an asshole and hung up.

745,ESH,"AITA for making my parents reveal the truth about, then “sl*t shaming” my(26M) mom about my conception?","I, this past Saturday found out that I am a product of my mom’s infidelity from a dna test.

Just some context, me and my dear old dad haven’t had a good relationship. Every since I was a kid, I picked up on the fact that he resented me. This kinda fed into my suspicion I was adopted. He was never physically abusive but was absolutely emotionally abusive to me as a kid. 

I have 2 sisters one older(28) and one younger(22) and my dad is extremely loving to them. I was always jealous and *HATED* my sisters for it until I was like 22. Me and them have since reconciled and now have  relationships. Me and my dad didn’t find some common understanding until like last year and still he is very withholding. He’s never once hugged me, he hasn’t said he loves me in nearly 20 years, every time I went to him for advice he’d berate me. He has told me on multiple occasions that I am a regrettable stain on our family. 

Honestly I wanted to just cut him out of my life but him and my mother are still together, and my mom wants me to have a better relationship with him. She was the one I went to after my dad hurt me, she was extremely loving and compassionate to me, she always told me that my dad was trying to show me how to be a man. 

I got everyone in my family at my place Saturday so o could make my discovery known to the whole family. I told them I knew I was adopted and my mom started crying. My dad then said, “You’re not adopted you’re just not mine.” Me and my sisters just sat there with mouths agape. I asked what that was supposed to mean.

According to my dad, my mom fucked one of her coworkers for a few months in 1993 and got knocked up with me. When she got pregnant, she ended the affair and just hoped I’d be my dads. When I was 3, my mom shacked back up with my bio dad and was caught white handed. They got a DNA test on me and my older sister, and a prenatal paternity test on my younger sister when mom found out she was pregnant again. I’m the only one that wasn’t his.

Upon learning I was so enraged at my mom and her husband, I yelled at them for making me find this out when I was 26 and not younger. I yelled at my dad saying, “Why the fuck would you stay in my life and show me so much hate. I couldn’t help it, I’m not the wh*re who couldn’t keep her legs closed.” And gestured at my mom. She began weeping and begged her husband to leave. They left and it was just me and my sisters, my baby sister was still crying and was pissed at my mom and dad, while my older sister was mad at me.

She told me I was being dramatic and wanted to put on a whole show, then called me a monster for speaking to my mother that way. I said she was being a wh@re, and my sister went off on me for sl?t shaming our mom. They both eventually left not before my older sister told me I was a massive asshole and needed to apologize.

747,ESH,WIBTA if I sold my roommates clothes?,"TLDR my roommate is refusing to pay rent. Should I sell her things?

I (19F) am living in a 2 bedroom apartment with my roommate (20F) Lily. We have been living together for a year and a half rather harmoniously while attending the same college. With 6 months left on our lease, she moved back in with her parents in a foreign country since we have online school this year. The past four months have been great having the apartment to myself. 

Last week she informed me that for December and January which are the last two months of our lease, she  will not be able to send the rent and that she wants to sublet. I told her that that’s fine as long as she can find someone who will move in in the next couple weeks as December is approaching. 

Today, she messaged me a long essay about the reasons why she can’t send the rent the next two months and that she cannot find a subletter. She said that her parents had been laid off due to covid and that they’re mad at her for spending money on rent when she could have stayed home since last may when lockdowns started. They’re refusing to give her money. I was shocked and confused because legally, our landlord will have to sue the both of us as both of our names are on the lease. I told her that as much as I understand her situation, she has to get a loan from the bank or something because she can’t just not pay rent??? 

Our conversation really started to turn sour when I realized that what she really wanted me to do was ask my parents for the money because she knew that my parents would probably rather just pay her rent rather than have to deal with legal issues. (My dad is a lawyer and he hates frivolous suits that waste time). Anyways, i really feel like I’m getting played here and I feel betrayed by someone who was my best friend. Needless to say, our relationship is forever ruined. She ended the call saying that she will not be paying rent and that her friends will come by to collect her things. 

Here’s the juicy part. My roommate has many designer goods in her closet including, but not limited to, clothes, shoes, and bags. If i sold some of these items on craigslist or something I definitely would be able to pay her share of the rent. However, I’m not sure how much of an asshole this would make me. Don’t give me legal advice, I’m just asking for ethical guidance because when I told my boyfriend he said i was a huge AH and that I should just tell my dad who will sort it out. (But i already know that he will just pay her portion and I really don’t like feeling.. used even if it is my parents’ money) I think I might be an AH because this is a snake move. 

WIBTA if i sold her things to pay her portion of the rent


INFO: there was a month last year where my roommate paid her rent a couple weeks late and the landlord sent us mail threatening to sue us. I reached out to her and said it was my roommates small mishap and she told me to watch out for more violations because they have company policies where they sue the tenants after a set number of weeks that goes by without receiving full rent, and she explicitly told me that we would both be sued if one of us didn’t pay. The landlord/manager that I deal with doesnt really have sway over company policy so i am presuming that they will not be lenient.",2020-11-19 13:10:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jx2eax/wibta_if_i_sold_my_roommates_clothes/,39,14,1.0,0
748,ESH,AITA for ruining my wife’s birthday trip by insisting either our son comes or no one goes?,"Long story but I’ll keep this brief.

My wife’s birthday was 2 weekends ago. We had planned to go on a long camping trip (6 days) and everything was all set and paid for. 

Roughly 3 days before departing, my wife got into another huge fight with our 12 yo son. They’ve been getting into small arguments and butting heads more and more but nothing like this. Apparently he was playing Minecraft on her laptop and downloaded something that crashed the computer. Nothing too terrible but my wife was worried her computer was permanently broken.

So there was a pretty easy solution to everything: go to a repair shop. But like always it devolved into a massive fight between them because our son was adamant he didn’t do anything wrong and my wife was adamant he did. 

It eventually got so bad my wife threatened to send him to stay with our neighbor by himself while we went on our trip if he doesn’t confess. He says fine leave without me. So my wife made up her mind to actually leave him with the neighbor for 6 days while we go on our trip. 

I tried to mediate but it’s the night before and my wife is still set on dropping him off at the neighbor’s. He’s also upset and has packed his stuff in preparation. At this point I basically put my foot down and said there’s no way in hell we’re actually doing this. This is insane, we’re a family, and if we can’t go together we shouldn’t go at all.

Long story and lots of drama short, the trip was cancelled. My wife refused to let our son come along and I refused to leave him behind. As a result she’s accused me of ruining the one week this year that she’s been excited for. I don’t know if I did the right thing in the end.

**Edit:** to everyone asking about how the laptop broke. It’s a really old computer and my wife accidentally spilled orange juice over it roughly a year ago when the problems started. The computer honestly crashes all the time. I’ve got no doubt my son’s games overtaxed it and crashed it again, but I don’t think his games were to blame for the problems starting.

**Edit2:** my son did have permission to play games and download specific mods related to the game (limited to a site we trust) without our knowing. So he didn’t really break any rules by playing the game or downloading. But the laptop was in increasingly poor shape and what used to be fine no longer was. My wife just seemed to forget about all the other times the laptop crashed and pinned every problem on this one instance.",2020-08-20 14:39:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/idbhkz/aita_for_ruining_my_wifes_birthday_trip_by/,665,2956,0.95,2

Sometimes I have my mini meltdowns that I deal with in private because this is some very heavy stuff to deal with at times and I feel like a bother when I come to people about it . My best friend knows what’s happening in my life . My best friend also lost her mom to cancer 6 months ago and I was there for her for everything . I even helped out with paying the bills . So I try not to bother her with my sickness too much as it still seems like a touchy subject . I had a mini melt down and called her crying . I told her I needed a friend just to grab coffee or anything so I wouldn’t be alone with my thoughts . After a couple minutes of talking she said she’s using the washroom and will call me right back . 15 minutes go by and no call , so I phone her 3 times (we usually call and call each other until someone picks up if it’s important) , no answer .

Im a loud person, not that I mean to be, and shes yelled at me in the mornings before for being too loud, that I will wake the baby and prevent her from sleeping, so I changed and am quieter in the mornings.... but what im gathering from her is that she wants me to deal with him crying, her watching TV, and keeping all the lights on while I'm trying to sleep for work... and i just feel like there is some sort of double-standard or some shit going on, cause she doesnt sleep until a couple of hours after he falls asleep and then they both sleep for like 12 hours.

751,ESH,AITA for laughing at my parents after they let my sister blow 140k of their retirement fund on pharmaceutical stocks?,"My parents are middle class people and are looking to retire hopefully after my sister finishes medical school. Also for ages, I am 27 and my sister is 22. I have been working for a while now and been investing the money I have. I basically bought some AMZN and some TSLA but most of my money I just keep in index funds and whatever funds they offer me through my work's retirement program. 

About a year ago my sister got into investing and I was happy for her, but since she didn't have money of her own she wanted to use my parents. And when I advised my parents not to, that they should just keep it in their stable mutual funds. 

My sister accused me of being sexist, that I am denying women the right to hold and control wealth too.. And my mom basically strong armed my dad into letting my sister manage some of their money.....

The account had $210k now it has 72k (during this time the market went up).......  When my dad found out about this he flipped out. I felt bad for them but then my mom said its okay this is the risk with stocks they go up and they go down. That see what happens in 10 years. 

After that, I was like you know you guys deserve this and started laughing at them. My dad is just upset and avoids the conversation entirely. But my mom and sister think of me as the bad guy because I am discouraging my sister from being financially savy and learning.",2020-10-21 18:23:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jfihnd/aita_for_laughing_at_my_parents_after_they_let_my/,59,309,0.93,0
752,ESH,AITA for not wanting to attend my SILs wedding without telling her?,"Okay, this is going to be long... a little back story, me (28F) and my husband got married this January.

The day after the wedding, on our post-wedding lunch, my MIL brought up that it was SIL to be wed next. My husband and I thought nothing of it at first, SIL and her BF were just 6 months into their relationship then, and they are not even engaged.

A few days later, while texting with a cousin, her congratulating me and the wedding and stuff, she told me that during the reception SIL announced that she'll be getting married next and basically took it as a chance to invite their side of the family. This, and the fact that she changed into another dress in the reception irked me. (All in the entourage wore the same gown and her changing made her stand out in the pictures)

NGL, I felt disrespected. I have been to many weddings and I've read enough reddit to know that you don't do that on someone's wedding.

I told my husband how I felt and he told me my feelings are valid. I waited for him to talk to his sister about it but he never did. I understood though as he's naturally introvert and it's in his nature to avoid conflict. I never brought it up myself as we have this deal ever since we've started dating to ""deal with your own side of the family"".

We kinda already forgot about it (cue pandemic) and have never thought of it again. We thought their wedding is going to be pushed back a few years cause of the gathering restrictions in our country.

Now a couple of months ago, she announced her wedding date, Jan 31. Our wedding was January 26. My husband's birthday is January 30. My birthday is January 28. I was furious. There are a lot of dates in the calendar. Why near the special days for us?

My husband told me she's so used to having the attention on her and can't take it when someone else is in the spotlight. She's a very sweet person though so everyone in the family is under her spell. We're afraid of bringing it up and just be told that we're just making a big deal out of it and/or we're the AH for not wanting to share our special day with a ""family"".

Now I'm thinking of planning a special trip for my husband and I on our anniversary/birthday. That is a valid excuse to not attend SILs wedding.

I'll tell them when the date is getting near cause I don't want to have a big confrontation and/or I don't want his fam to guilt trip us into attending. 

AITA?

Add: no im not claiming January as what some comments imply. I might have worded that poorly so it's my bad. What made me upset is that she chose the date expecting us to just not have plans and be there. It didn't matter that we told her when she first mentioned it that we are planning to be away around that time. (Hence saying a trip is already booked sounded a good idea, we already told them before) She still booked the date. As our birthdays are so close together, if we aren't out of the country, we always have just 1 big party on my husband's birthday. If family are already expecting to drive 3 hours to attend her wedding, I'm already expecting them to not be there for ours.

Lastly, I know my judgment is flawed and I accept that my hurt could be clouding my rationale, which is why is opted to ask here. I'm an introvert too and I can't talk about this with my fam so I chose to ask strangers instead.

I'm just hurt by the fact that I am expected to be of decorum when I didn't even get the same courtesy.",2020-11-18 02:43:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jw7jm8/aita_for_not_wanting_to_attend_my_sils_wedding/,44,12,0.88,0
753,ESH,AITA for telling my dad to hold on when I was the middle of something,"So earlier today I got grounded for telling my dad to hold on when I was in the middle of a match on my computer. Here’s how it went down.

So I’m just casually playing my computer.

Dad: OP. Come here.

Me: Hold on, I’ll come do it.

Dad: Now.

Me (still finishing up what I was doing): Just a second.

Dad: I don’t give a shit about your game, come here.

Me: Wait a minute.

My dad proceeds to run right to my room.

Dad: WHEN I TELL YOU TO COME HERE YOU STOP WHAT YOURE DOING ON THAT GAME. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU DONT CARE. GET BACK ON YOUR GAME, GO AHEAD. APPARENTLY ITS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THIS. (He needed me to move a bench)

I silently get back into my chair, when my dad busts into my room again.

Dad: MOM SAID YOURE GROUNDED. THAT GAME ISNT IMPORTANT, ITS A FUCKING GAME. 

My dad later half-apologized, telling me when he needs something done he needs it done now. He said that he can tell me “hang on” because what he’s doing is usually more important than what I’m doing.

754,ESH,AITA for getting tired and not consoling my girlfriend when she has mental breakdowns?,"My (26m) girlfriend (30f) has deep self esteem and abandonment issues that she says she’s been working on. We have talked about therapy over and over. She goes... sometimes? I used to try to make her feel better every time she cried... until I realized nothing I say or do makes a difference anymore. 

Yesterday we were both hungry and so instead of me normally going to go to get it for us, I asked instead if she wanted to pick up the food  for us right down the road. (Hoping she says yes because I can’t remember the last time I had time alone) she says “if you come with me, yeah” . This upset me so much because it meant that I had to do it no matter what. (There’s been times in the past where she was unable to do basic things and I had to do them on my own and it really frustrate me) 

Anyway, I go to pick up the food and my online order didn’t work and I didn’t have my card with me. So I wasn’t getting the food and I was driving back home entry handed, That made me even more upset. As I come in, she can tell I’m frustrated and I tell her “I’m just not in the mood right now” “I’m not in a good mood” and she knows that when I say that it means I’m asking for space. 

Well she doesn’t take space very well. Instead of her leaving me alone, she starts to ask me  “what are you eating?” “Is it good?” “What are you watching?” 

I admit I was a little rude when I snapped back asking her why she’s all of a sudden so curious what I’m doing and especially at a time I asked her to leave me alone. 

This was yesterday. She has been moping and crying for the past two days. She bought a 6 pack earlier and is now on her last beer after crying back and forth in the bathroom and in my car and in the bathroom and back to my car.

I really just want to shove headphones in at this point. I feel bad for her, I really do. And I’ve tried to help her in the past get over her fears and anxieties. But nothing I say helps. I can’t sit there and pretend everything is okay when she refused to give me space and then has been making a scene these past two days. 

She will inevitably say that I “shut her out” and “ignored her” and she’s right to an extent. I was upset that she couldn’t just do the simple thing of getting the food on her own. And I would have told her why I was upset, and I will tell her why I was upset, but she knew I wanted space and then proceed to cling on me harder... and then when I told her again I wanted space again, she mopes next to me for TWO DAYS so technically I still haven’t gotten my space!

755,ESH,"AITA for telling my friend, who thinks he's God's Gift to Women, that he's not qualified to give dating advice because he ended up with a 35-year-old single mum?","I'm still in touch with a few of my former HS classmates (we're in our late 20's) and there's this one guy, Luke, who thinks he's a bit of a player cause he used to sleep around a lot (mostly quantity over quality) up until last year. He's now in a relationship, so he's stopped having fuck-buddies and hooking up, but he's not shy to talk about his ""glory days"".

Anyway, we had a get-together on Friday and another one of my friends, Harry, was telling us how he has some issues with the woman he's seeing, so Luke thought it fell on him to ""educate"" Harry and impart his wisdom. He started going on about how Harry's girlfriend is only acting out because he's not ""playing the field"" at all and that he needs is to make her aware that he has other options beside her.

We all kinda thought he was joking at first, but it soon became clear he was serious, so Harry told him he's not interested in doing that and to grow up.

Luke insisted and told Harry that nothing drives women more than competition, so even if he doesn't have anything else going on, he should still let her think that he does, just to make her jealous a bit.

Harry told him to cut it out and that he's not qualified to give dating advice anyway. 

He laughed and said that he that if anyone knows what he's talking about in this table, it's him, cause he's the most experienced of all of us (which is technically true).

I had started getting annoyed at Luke too, so I jumped in at that point and told him that if he really knew what he was talking about, then he wouldn't have ended up dating a 35-year-old with a toddler for his first serious relationship.

Everyone else laughed, but Luke didn't find it funny at all and asked me what the fuck did I mean by that. 

So I told him that if he's such an authority on dating, then he could probably do better.

He said he's perfectly happy with his partner and told me to stay in my lane.

I told him to take his own advice and to stop offering his opinion when no one asked for it.

Things were a bit tense after that, but we moved on from the subject. Still, was I the Asshole for piling on?

756,ESH,AITA for basically calling a rude woman fat?,"First things first, I am male, 19 years old, really tall, skinny and look quite sporty.

Two days before this happened I went downhill biking and fell quite bad. Due to the fall I had my wrist in a splint and my leg was killing me when standing or walking. Yes, I am dumb for not going to the doctor but I didn't feel like sitting in a waiting room for hours with covid out there.

Now let's get into the meat of what happened. I was sitting on a bench at a bus stop, waiting for my bus. A quite overweight lady (not older than 30) walked to the bus stop and just stood about half a meter next to me, not saying anything. My mind was somewhere else because it was a long day. After about 5 minutes my bus arrived, I got up as the bus was approaching when this conversation happened.

Her:""Finally you let me sit, why not sooner?"" (Annoyed exhale)

Me:""I'm sorry, what?""

Her:""You heard me. You entitled brat just hug that space without toughts for anyone else!!!""

Me:""(Points to splint) My arm and leg is injured, it's agony to stand...and you didn't even ask""

Her:""Pffff, You're young, how bad can it be?""

Me:"" OK...Judging by your appearance the word sport injury doesn't mean anything to you.""

Her face as the realisation hit was priceless 10/10 would insult again.

And also, I Translated everything into english.

Now you be the judge, was I in the wrong?

&#x200B;

TLDR: I didn't offer a woman my seat, she was annoyed about it, told me I couldn't be injured because I was young and I pretty much called her fat.


Edit: You have to keep in mind that I was in quite a considerable amount of pain, had a long day and didn't have a shit left to give.

757,ESH,AITA for telling my roommate he can take the money he owes me off of my portion of split bills?,"Ima try to make a long story short. My roommate was my best friend. We moved in together to leave shitty situations we were in. He’s bought me food when i didn’t have money, paid for ubers for me, i’ve done the same with him and have picked him up when we needed rides. He would tell me not to pay him back for anything because “If he had it and could help the homies, he would.”

When he moved he said he’d pay half the money for the uhaul. That half was around $50. I let him use my headphones, he lost them. He said he’d pay me back, that’s $20. 

I kept asking him for my money, and noticed he was eating my food, not properly taking care of his dog. It came to a head when he was at his girlfriends and his dog pissed and shit on our new couch. He came home, i told him i wasn’t okay with taking care of his dog anymore cuz he barely takes care of the dog himself. We ended up getting into an argument about it. We’ve only spoken when i noticed he has money to buy weed and a bong but can’t pay me back. He asked me to pay him back for all the ubers and food he bought me. I told him nah, cuz he told me not to pay him back multiple times when he asked, and that’s his fault for spending the money if he wants to be vindictive about it now. 

He put me and my mom in a group chat (she was our co-signer for the apartment) detailing what i owed him for the bill in his name. I told him he can take the money he owed me off the total since he’s been refusing to pay me back, but buys drugs, alcohol, and orders take out multiple times a week for himself. An argument ensued, and he told me i can’t use personal debt for money for bills. I told him the money is all the same, because i would’ve been paying bills with the money he owed me anyway (i am deep in debt after losing my job due to the pandemic).

758,ESH,Aita for threatening to take back the toilet?,"
I am a 25 y/o ftm trans guy who lives with my 28 y/o cis boyfriend and my 2 1/2 year old son. My boyfriend and I are both bi, which will factor in later. My son is autistic.

Last fall, my grandfather unexpectedly passed away and left my grandma alone in the house they built. She had never lived by herself before and thought she wouldn't be able to do the repairs on the house by herself. None of my family wanted to help her so she asked my boyfriend and I to move in and repair the house. She offered to let us live rent free and help watch my son while we did repairs. We have a lease that clarifies all this as well.

So far we have repaired a shed, repaired a greenhouse, bought and put in a new toilet, bought and put in new pipes for the heating system, bought and put in a new stove, got the septic tank pumped plus a new septic line, got tile to redo the bathroom and kitchen floors,cleaned out the garage and my grandfather's effects, starting working on completely overhauling their second half-bath, helped get her cat put down and buried it, planning to replace the fridge, planning to replace the shower

All while working to pay for it all and taking care of a toddler with special needs.

To thank us, my grandma has been awful in return. She swears at my son and tried teaching him to call my boyfriend and I ""stupid worthless hoes"" and telling him that he is a ""stupid worthless hoe"" because he's our child. When I caught this, and asked ""why?""   she excused it by saying that ""he won't say it back because he's nonverbal so it's fine."" 

Very not fine, but we talked and I stopped letting her alone with him. Then the homophobia began. She began calling my boyfriend ""tinkerbell"" and ""Liberace"". She began making snide comments to me about ""Chaz Bono being a loser for not staying Chastity"" in reference to myself also being a trans man. Just rude little comments. 

It ended up coming to a head when she said something about how of course my son is (her words) ""r*tarded"", and that it's because I'm ""a worthless queer"".

I snapped. I reminded her that we just signed our new lease so we have 10 months left here, legally. If she wants to make them difficult, she can, but...

""...When we leave we're taking the toilet."" 

She got so mad and started asking why and saying that was elder abuse. I replied, ""if you hate people who aren't straight, why would you want a toilet bought with fag money? Get a straight person to buy your new toilet.""

My whole family is mad at me now but tbh I don't think I did anything wrong. Aita?

Edit: I thought it was pretty obvious by how ridiculous the idea of taking a toilet with someone is, but I have zero intention of actually taking the toilet. I said it sarcastically as an empty threat to demonstrate that we didn't have to move in or help but we did anyway.

Edit 2: for people not getting it, after that one incident, my grandma hasn't been around my son and we have several nanny cams anyway. He isn't in danger or being mistreated and we're moving back to the state we're from December 8th anyway.",2020-11-22 17:48:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jyzvo4/aita_for_threatening_to_take_back_the_toilet/,30,9,0.81,0

I'm trying to get more established so I can stop working in the kitchen and do my own thing. I had a very good friend serve a party for me with a couple other people I know. I wasn't present at the event but prepared everything and sent the food out with the servers. I paid $150 cash per person (3 total servers) for 4 hours of work, so $37.50 an hour. I paid one person in cash the next day, then owed 2, say Joe and Ryan their money. I unfortunately don't use venmo because of some conflicts with a new phone number so ""Joe"" was going to take the $300 and send the $150 to ""Ryan"" but Joe decides since Ryan owes him $20 that I should pay Joe $170 and Ryan $130. He said he would just send him $130 and he'd never know. I refused to let that happen. I said what you two owe each other is not part of my business and I want to pay each person the $150 I said I would pay.

764,ESH,AITA for refusing to sell my son's painting to his mum when she couldn't go because my wife went to his exhibition?,"My childrens' school has this yearly art exhibition fundraising event thing where people can buy various works from the art students. The kids have dress all smart and try sell to us. It's always nice and I try attend every year but this year my son was amongst the students. Due to covid the school was pretty strict and limited two guests per student to allow a few potential outside buyers to come as well. My son asked me to be one of them but was stuck on who to give the second space to between my wife and his mother since he wanted both to go. I told him to sleep on it and the next day he chose my wife since he'd be spending the weekend with us afterwards so it would be easier. Makes sense but his mother was not too pleased and told me to tell him that he mustn't feel obligated to take my wife only because of the weekend and ask him if he's was still sure. Wasn't comfortable with that so I said no. She can tell him herself. She was mad but accepted it.

The event was last friday evening and was rather fruitful for my son. He had three complete pieces and two of them were bought almost immediately after it started by this other outside couple which was fantastic for him. All three were amazing but one (which coincidentally was the unbought one) was just perfect for my wife's office and so we bought it. Went home, celebrated then enjoyed the rest of our weekend together. The morning after he went back to his mum, she called giving me an earful on how selfish we were for first blocking her from going and then for buying his art for ourselves and not thinking about her when she also wanted it. Apparently she wasn't aware that they would also be selling it at the exhibition. I told her that there was only one left and I wasn't going to muscle two because its better for 'outsiders' to buy the majority and not his parents. She then said that it was only fair that she buys the one we bought off us since we went to and she's now missed out (she used 'robbed') on the event itself and the opportunity to get his art. 

I kind of understand her but no. My son chose who he chose to come and we want the painting. I said she could get a printed version of it but she doesn't want that and is making a big kerfuffle over this.

765,ESH,AITA for wanting to keep my Nonna's pasta recipe a secret?,"My Nonna (grandmother) made the most delicious version of a well known pasta dish but she vowed to never tell her recipe. She wouldn't even let people into the kitchen when she was cooking it! 

Recently my Nonna got sick and passed away, and my family has been sorting through the items in her house. My boyfriend located a drawer full of handwritten recipes and found the recipe for the pasta, with two surprising ingredients. We didn't tell the rest of my family at first because we wanted to make it first to be sure it was really the recipe. A few days later we made it and it was like Nonna was back and in my kitchen. So good!

I told my boyfriend that I thought it was a sign that we found it and that we were meant to carry on the legacy of Nonna's secret pasta. I said we should make it for my family at our next get together but still not tell anyone what the recipe was, and he agreed that would be funny.

Yesterday though I got a message from one of his friends saying that my Nonna's pasta was delicious???? I asked my boyfriend and he told me that he had posted the recipe in a groupchat. He said it casually as if he did nothing wrong!

I got angry at him and said that he knew she wanted it secret. He said that it was honoring Nonna to share her good cooking with everyone and that her memory would live on through the delicious pasta. I started yelling that it doesn't work like that and it got worse from there where he said I was overreacting and that we have no idea what she would have wanted for the recipe after her passing. He even said that if I really believed it was a sign that we found it, that HE was the one who found it and it was up to him to decide what to do with it!!! Eventually he apologized, but the damage is done.

I answered his friend and told her to please get rid of the recipe and never make it again. I asked my boyfriend if I could look through the groupchat and he was resistant but then let me. He shared the recipe with 11 people!! And after he shared it one of them responded with 👻🍝 emojis, which is so insensitive. I did make him message the chat to ask them all to please delete the recipe. I worry they won't though.

I have not told my family yet but I am going to before they find out from someone else. I am so hurt by my boyfriend's actions and it's difficult to look at him the same way. My friends all say I'm being melodramatic but this secret recipe is a big part of my Nonna's identity and casually sharing it feels SO disrespectful.",2020-09-05 16:57:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/in4kh4/aita_for_wanting_to_keep_my_nonnas_pasta_recipe_a/,341,1407,0.93,1
766,ESH,AITA for saying my boyfriend needs to be more active with our dog?,"We had adopted a pure bred. He had his mind set on a high energy dog. He doesn’t have much experience with bigger dogs or any with high energy dogs. And he’s allowed to want what he wants. Of course he is. Prior to moving in together for the first time we opted to get a dog though. And he’s only ever had a small dog, once in his life. 

I tried telling him that high energy dogs you really need o keep them active a lot throughout the day otherwise they get destructive and stray from their training. I talked him about it so many times. He assured me over and over that he gets it and bias his heart set on this breed. 

So we get the puppy and move in. She’s now 5 months old and her energy is growing with her. Which I know all about and get it. But he doesn’t. He works from home and I work out of the house. 

On my days off I encourage him to bring her out to get her energy out. But she is now afraid of the car. We live on a small block and walking hr up and down  it isn’t enough. We live near some main roads so walking her around the neighborhood isn’t an option. And we don’t have a house with a fenced in yard. 

But he’s just not doing what’s he should while he’s home for her. He won’t do what’s necessary like training her and helping her be more comfortable in the car. Because you can work over with that. She used to be but she got spooked so we need to help her get more comfortable so we can take her on long hikes and stuff. So since he’s not doing that and then she gets in the car she drools a lot and throws up and then he gets mad about it. 

Then he gets mad about how energetic she is in the house. He says he takes her out twice a day for half an hour to play but I know he doesn’t. And even that isn’t enough. She needs more stimulation. 

He lets her jump up to signal she needs to go out so now she jumps on all doors and counters. And he lets her chew on “her” towel so now she chews on all fabrics. 

Instead of helping her get her energy out the right way he just gives her a bully stick and she goes through them so quick. It’s like he’s giving her bandaids.

Every time I bring up the right way to get her energy out he gets mad at me and says I’m being critical. I try to not sound harsh and approach it nicely. But it’s true that she needs more stimulation then a bully stick and being taken out ion a leash a couple times a day, and maybe for a walk every couple of days when I have the time to do so. 

tl;dr: boyfriend doesn’t help high energy dog get her energy out productively, gets mad at the dogs behavior and then gets mad at me when I try to correct it.",2020-11-22 14:36:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jywll0/aita_for_saying_my_boyfriend_needs_to_be_more/,39,6,1.0,0
767,ESH,AITA for being rude to my best friend after she backed out of signing a lease,"So my best friend (of over 5 years) and I were planning for several months to live together and sign a lease starting in July, since both of our leases were going to be up. My previous apartment’s lease was up mid-July, so I definitely needed a place before then. Because of covid we weren’t able to view the apartment, but the pictures on the company’s website all looked really nice so we decided to go with it. Long story short, the apartment was nothing like any of the pictures and had water damage, so we both decide to cancel the lease.

We’re in the process of searching for an apartment in a location and price that works for us both, I find a place we agree on, until my friend refuses to sign a lease unless we can tour the apartment — understandable since we got screwed over last time, but the pics for each individual unit were online so we knew exactly what we were getting and, again, covid precautions wouldn’t allow tours.

I manage to get the landlord to show us the place, and my friend doesn’t even want to see it, claiming the rent would be “too expensive”. The rent is actually CHEAPER than the first place we planned on renting, even with electric & internet (which ends up being less than $50 after it’s split every month, despite her telling me internet alone would cost over $100). So I’m pretty pissed off because this girl has either been extremely unaware of her financial situation for months (and honestly, you’re not gonna find a place for cheaper than what I’m paying rn unless it’s in a sketchy area, so I don’t know how she can possibly afford wherever she is now), or she’s using this as an excuse to get out of living with me, because things did get a little tense between us while looking for the second place. I did ask her if she was open to taking a loan out for rent, since she said that’s what she did for her previous lease (a place that’s at least $200 more than the ones I found), and she took that as me *expecting* her to take out a loan, which was very clearly not what I said at all.

I was definitely rude at times, because it’s tiring to keep hearing excuses about why an apartment won’t work but not have her offer up any alternatives, but I never crossed a line or overreacted, just called her out on her bs. I did get argumentative about her backing out and leaving me with less than a month to find either a decent roommate or a sublease, but I don’t see why I’d be nice and friendly to someone who’s screwing me over and doesn’t feel bad about it. She sent me a sublease ad for a place saying “this would be great for you!” and maybe she was genuinely trying to help and cared, but the apartment was 1) not in a preferred area, and 2) a 3BR/1B for the price of my 2BR now in a great area. I responded that I don’t know why it would matter to her what would be great for me since she was so ready to screw me over in the first place. We haven’t talked since, except to get the security deposit from the first place back.",2020-11-21 16:06:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jyd775/aita_for_being_rude_to_my_best_friend_after_she/,16,32,0.9,0
768,ESH,AITA for refusing to pay for anything under $100?,"My boyfriend (24M) is out of his normal job due to the worlds circumstances, he’s doing small jobs to get by and is making enough money to buy video games, food, gas, bills, etc. I (21F) just got promoted to a high management position in my job, I make enough money to pay for things comfortably and don’t mind it because at some point, I was out of a job and he “held it down” in a sense. 

Our house is currently being built, so we’re living with my parents, and during this time they refuse to let us pay for any big bills so we’re sneaking $100-$200 in whenever we can convince them to let us. 

My boyfriend wants to “save” his money and claimed he was paying for everything, mind you, he’s only making about 1000 month vs my 3400) so when I asked him how that’d work to save money when he’s hardly bringing anything in, he told me he plans too save 50% of his pay.

I then asked how he plans to help me pay for anything, he told me from now on, he’s ONLY to pay for small things (Gas, oil changes, minor car problems, little fast food trips and small purchases like basic hygiene items.) He then wants me to pay for major things (Phone bill, groceries, car insurance, and any major unexpected expense) all while claiming he pays for “everything.” 

I obviously know this isn’t the case, as I was paying half or all of most necessities and any luxuries since he is currently out of his normal job and I’m currently making triple what he is. I never bring up what he pays for, how much I paid for xxxx and how he owes me half, etc. because I don’t hold it against him but since he decided he “pays for everything” and wanted to do it this way, I agreed because I know this is false and that he’ll see how much all the “little things” add up.

It’s been 4 days since pay day, I still have about $700 left after paying for car insurance, phone bills, groceries, and my own health insurance which are all the major expenses I agreed too since he said he refuses to pay ANY THING that’s a “significant” amount. He has about $100 left after paying for gas, hygiene items, oil change, fast food, games, small items.

He said, “I only have $100, what do you have?” When I told him how much I had, he assumed I’d be paying for the rest of our gas, and small items until pay day. Here’s where I may be TA, I told him no and that I refuse to pay for anything else because he claims he already pays for everything anyway and I never help him. Since I’m only responsible for large expenses so I did my part of the plan HE made without consulting me. 

I’m more than happy to pay for a majority of things since I’m making more for now, I’m more than happy to help him save and budget but I’m not happy that he demanded we do this without ever talking to me about it and said I don’t pay for anything.

769,ESH,AITA? I told my mom to stop talking about my nephew because I'm tired of Golden Boy.,"(Note: everything has been anonymized, but the core story's still the same, of course.)


I have a nephew named ""Jack"". No point in trying to hide this fact: I'm jealous of him. I'm so jealous my blood probably runs green. The fact isn't super relevant to the post, I just wanted to acknowledge it upfront.


Four years ago, Jack's life started coming together (of course he worked hard, too, like taking overtime whenever it was available, networking, etc) and he got a nice tech hardware job. Since then, Golden Boy Jack has lived under a lucky star.


He *never* shuts up about it.


You will always hear about how great he's doing, how much money he's making, the expensive house he's going to buy, etc. If it wasn't for the bragging and the family always talking about him, I would be able to shrug and move on. Jack and I are different people who are at different life stages. He hasn't had to deal with severe mental health issues to clear his way.


He won't let you forget about how *awesome* he is. Oh, he cured his anxiety with weed. Of course, if there's something he doesn't want to do, oops! Anxiety, gotta leave. 


He chased off a car-jacker with a frying pan. He has a pretty girlfriend. He's going to buy an expensive house. He's making 10,000 a month (after Covid, it'll be a paltry 8,000). He outsmarts everyone in arguments. On, and on, and on, and *on* about his every ""cool"" action and accomplishment.


The family eats it up. Pretty sure his parents have a shrine to him somewhere in their basement. My mom and grandma adore him. I used to as well . . . until Jack turned into a braggart.


My accomplishments? If Jack is around, he starts talking about himself. It must be an automatic response by now. Otherwise, everybody shrugs off what I say. I've gone so far and worked so hard, but because I don't have the big paycheck, the cute girlfriend, the expensive house, and the big mouth to go with it, I'm a nobody.


The ""Jack is God"" thing has been going on for about four years now. It comes up any time family is discussed, and of course, when he or his parents come around, it's Jack Time. You should listen to Jack Time when Jack himself is hosting it. 


I am at my absolute limit.


This afternoon, mom and I were sitting in my office and she started talking about how Jack is making 10,000 a month. I told her that's great and I was tired of hearing about how great Jack's life is going.


I told mom that I didn't want to hear about the Golden Boy, that listening to someone be lauded day after day while you've been scrabbling for success for years gets tiring.


Mom called me a jealous asshole, told my grandma, and now grandma thinks I'm an asshole as well. I don't think I am. I've held my tongue for **FOUR** years.


Let him enjoy his luck and success, but stop making me listen to it so much. Can't he send a postcard or something like normal people?

770,ESH,AITA for yelling in the Chic-fil-a drive thru?,"Ok... so I just finished grocery shopping and went by Chic-fil-a to pick up dinner for my 4 year old daughter and myself. The line is wrapped around the building but moving pretty well. I get to the split near the ordering stations and an employee approaches my truck. He takes our order, I pay, and then dont move for about 5 to 7 minutes. Mind you, the other lane is just flying by. This woman in a white Audi SUV was giving the employee taking her order a hell of a time. I saw her hands flapping, him pushing buttons on the tablet frantically, and my patience was wearing thin. I stick my head out the window and said, ""Hey dude, is there any way you can get her to pull forward or something?  I paid like 5 minutes ago.""  He looked at me, nodded 'Yes' and then went right back to what they were doing before. Then after another few minutes, I looked in my rear view mirror and EVERYONE in the drive thru was looking past my truck with their heads hanging out their windows. Cars even started to beep. Then I stuck my head out the window and said, ""Cmon dude... this is getting ridiculous. Please make her move up or something.""  Then the lady pulls forward to where you get your receipt. Her order still isn't done. I hear her complaining about me yelling and then proceeds to order with 2 other Chic-fil-a employees. She kept saying, ""I dont care whatever you charge me but I want to be able to see the extra cheese on all the salads.""  She single handedly stopped the drive thru for a good 10 minutes. She finally pulls up to the window and keeps giving them instructions on how she wants her salads, keeps adding to her order, ""I dont care whatever you charge me, I want blah blah blah.""  She pays and the employee at the window asks her to pull around to a parking spot in the front to wait for her food. The employee asked her about 5 - 10 times to move to the parking spot. Mind you, at this point, my 4 year old is in the back seat doing the pee pee dance in her car seat.  I almost got out and was gonna help her pop a squat in front of this ladys truck. She stalled so my times to spite me. I know this, bc when she finally started to pull up and out of the drive thru, she went as slow as possible then looked at me in her side view mirror, smiled and waved at me. I hit her with some unpleasantries and flipped her the bird. Then when I drove past her leaving Chic-fil-a, I stared her dead in her face and she wouldn't even look at me.

771,ESH,AITA for washing kids’ artwork off my property?,"My neighbors’ kids (7 and 9) vandalized my driveway with elaborate chalk art. I caught them when I came out to walk my dog. 

They had covered the length of the crosswalk and my, admittedly large,  driveway completely. Apparently it was for an online art contest, and they needed the space, and had to take pictures when they were done. I think they, or at least their parents, should’ve asked me first before claiming my property. 

I immediately told them to move, grabbed my hose and washed it off. The older child started to cry very loudly and the younger followed, and they ran off. Later in the day I got a phone call from their mother about how they’re heartbroken that I could be so “cruel”, and that they weren’t causing any permanent damage. She said they would’ve cleaned up after they were done, and I should apologize to them.

772,ESH,AITA for not taking my plate to the sink and basically suggesting my partner's parents raised him wrong?,"A bit of background. Been with my partner for 5 years. Get along really well but right now I'm working full time during the week and work about 5 hrs per day every Saturday and Sunday at a second job. I don't have a day off, essentially. He does not work and is awaiting entry into a university program. I have been the sole breadwinner for awhile. I'm ok with that, but I am stressed. 

The other night we were eating around 8pm in living room as I had gotten off around 7pm and he got back from helping his parents around 7:30. I finished the dishes  and swept and vacuumed and separated the laundry before he got back. 

He cooked  and we ate in the living room and I sat back on the couch just to kind of relax and watch tv before I got a bit of work done and then went to bed. 

I finished eating first and would have taken the plates  to the kitchen sink but I just wanted to relax after working such a long day (my profession has me working long hours). I'm just so tired all the time. I have anxiety which hits at night so sleep is precious to me. 

Anyway, he finishes and takes his plate and his cup only to the sink, leaving my plate and cup there. 

So this is where I think I might be the asshole. I got up, taking my dishes and told him ""hey thanks for taking my plate."" 

He responded that he cooked and I was like, well I finished cleaning the kitchen after work and I take your plates to the sink every time I take mine.""

And he told me ""when?"" 

I was like ""ok"" and put my dishes back on the coffee table and went to my desk to work without talking to him. He asked me why I was mad and I told him that the polite thing to do was to take my dishes too.

He argued that I was rude when I said it and should not expect him to be my slave and that I'm an adult and should clean up after myself. I told him that i work two jobs and still take care of my chores (sometimes a little late but I'm the only one to do the bathroom or mop and deep clean). That this wasn't about the division of labor but about simple courtesy but if he wants to make it about the division of labor, let's go. I told him that with him not working, and me working two jobs and still being responsible for a good amount of house work, the division isn't fair. 

He said that while he doesn't want to compare me to his mom, his mom is still able to work full time and take care of a much bigger house basically on her own without much help from his dad. I told him I guess that's why you are the way you are and who am I to try to change 29 years of skewed gender roles and fucked up parenting in his household.


He says I'm the asshole for bringing up the fact that he doesn't work, suggesting that  he should do more when he already does a lot (he does but not close to everything in our apt.) and bringing his upbringing in this (his mom works full time, does 100% of the cleaning and cooking and did the child rearing) I say I'm not because he was the one who brought up everything and it's all true.

Obviously there are bigger issues going on but AITA in that moment?

773,ESH,AITA for telling my dad that he is disgusting?,"My dad is very mean to me. He always snores very loud at night, and I can't sleep at all because of him. The rumbling sound is so scary, and it sounds like the house will collapse the next minute. When he sits on the couch, he often just starts snoring, and I find it annoying. We've tried medication and therapy on him, but nothing seems to stop his snoring.

Apart from that, he also eats with his bare hands. He slouches on the couch and eats everything with his bare hands, and he puts his feet up on the table in the living room. He slouches in front of the TV, and he never eats with the rest of the family. After he eats, he just puts his dirty dishes back in the cupboard without even bothering to wash it. He also touches things with his dirty, greasy hands.

The worst part about it is that my dad never brushes his teeth. After he eats dinner, he just resumes watching TV. He always has bad breath, and his teeth are all brown or yellow. His breath is intolerable, and when he talks, it smells gross. He eats several hard boiled eggs for breakfast, and he rips up a muffin into 50 tiny pieces to eat it, which I totally don't understand.

So a few days ago I told my dad that I'm fed up with his gross habits. I told him that his behavior is unacceptable, and that he is setting a terrible example for the family.

774,ESH,AITA for going over my professors head to avoid a presentation and landing her in hot water?,"This happened last year, but I'm still wondering.

I took a required fine arts english class in my final year that didn't have anything to do with my major. The prof, A, spent most of the time chatting. He would also show us videos in other languages with no subtitles. It was a strange class and it lead to almost no one taking it seriously. He then injured his hip pretty badly, and this happened on a day I was supposed to present something worth a lot of my grade. He said everyone who had to present for the rest of the year would get an A if we emailed him what we had.

My FU: I didn’t. I have no excuse other than being overloaded. He also gave no deadline, so I forgot. But I acknowledge that this all could’ve been avoided had I just emailed my project, which was done!

The course got taken over by J, who was considerably more strict. She was angry that no one took the course seriously as we were 2/3rds of the way through (ex. she spent one day just yelling at us bc a few students left early.) The curriculum was so vague that I don't think even she knew what to do, I don't blame her for being upset.

A few days before the final week, I smashed my head. I then threw up, and then promptly took myself to the doctor’s office and got sent home indefinitely.

Then, me, and four other students got an email from J, saying that since we never emailed our projects, we had to present on the last class in less than a week. I emailed back saying I’m sorry, but I had zero time to prepare, and I had a concussion: here's my doc's note and my project. To which she said no, come present (in front of a giant, bright lecture hall), or fail. 

I asked if I could present to just her over the phone, or in a dark office alone. She said no, I ""really needed to make some sort of effort” and that my letter from the doc was “clearly expired”? Two of the other students had asked to just not present and she just agreed and they passed. She dismissed that completely when I mentioned it. My friend hypothesized that she was still upset that no one took her seriously, and she didn't want everyone to get a handout, which I get. My doc wrote a second note directly to J. She still didn’t care and was rather condescending.

So I went to the head of her department with the email receipts, both of J and I's back and forth, and A's original email, my finished project and both doc's notes. The head was horrified and sent me home. I didn't present and apparently J was clearly upset I wasn't there. I'm fairly certain that she got in shit as I got a very short apology and passed. 

I was never mean to her, and I felt like I tried so hard to compromise. I've never argued with a prof about anything else.

Some friends and my mom disapprove of how I handled this. It was my fault for not just sending it right away. And I do understand the frustration J was facing, maybe this was out of character for her and I got her in shit.

775,ESH,AITA for telling my friend's wife what his Magic The Gathering collection is worth?,"So my friend Jared and I used to play a lot of trading card games when we were younger.  We mainly focused on Magic the Gathering.  As we got older we had less and less time for the game so I sold off most of my collection while Jared got into collecting cards as a hobby/investment.  He was pretty good at it too.  Having seen what his collection is up to recently I would conservatively estimate its value at about $50,000.   For those who know MTG he has several pieces of Power 9, a binder full of alpha, beta, and revised dual lands, and several binders of valuable cards from sets spanning the entire life of the game.  He also has a few boxes of unopened booster packs from old sets and a few unopened booster boxes.  

&#x200B;

Jared and I have spoken at length about his future plans with the money he hopes to make selling off his collection down the road.  This is why I was surprised to find out later that his wife Kim had no idea what those cards were worth.

&#x200B;

Kim had stopped by to pick up some things from my wife and we got to talking.  Kim was talking about how she'd like to go on a little vacation once the pandemic was over, but couldn't justify the expense.  Thinking nothing of it I joked about having Jared sell a piece of his ""retirement fund"" referencing his collection.  Kim laughed and said she couldn't see them getting much of a vacation out of a few trading cards.  I asked her what kind of vacation would she be having that would run her over 50 grand and she got confused.  Turns out Kim had always assumed the cards were worth some money, but nothing even close to their actual value since she had no knowledge of the game.  I told her his collection was worth a lot more than just a few hundred dollars and gave her my estimate based on what I'd seen before.  Kim thanked me, grabbed her things, and left.

I got several angry messages from Jared the next day.  Apparently Kim had been furious with him for not telling her how much the cards were worth and was now trying to get him to sell off some cards to put toward a vacation as well as some things around the house she had been wanting for awhile but holding off because she didn't think they could afford it.   Jared told me I should have kept my mouth shut about the value of the cards and that I started a whole mess of drama that didn't need to happen.  He has since stopped responding to my messages.  It has been almost a week and from what I hear from my wife things are still pretty tense over at their house.

776,ESH,AITA for not showing up to a driving lesson I didn’t even know was scheduled.,"I took a summer course covering driving laws, and the driving school was supposed to contact me to schedule me for driving lessons. 

The lady from the driving school, who I’ll call Cindy (fake name) was trying to call my mother initially, but my mother told her that she needed to deal with me directly. I have gotten calls from them the past week, but I’ve been swamped with university work and quite frankly just don’t have the time or energy for this right now. I also work both days on the weekend. For this reason, I have ignored every single one of their calls (I might be the asshole for this, at least my dad says I am). I never ONCE spoke to ANYBODY from this company and confirmed a driving lesson and neither did my mother. 

Cindy took it upon herself to schedule me for lessons at 8 am on saturdays despite not having spoken to me ONCE. So the poor driving instructor who was just following his schedule showed up at 8 am to pick me up, but since I had work this morning, and I NEVER booked this class in the first place, I can’t go. My mom agrees it’s not my fault (but she says I should’ve picked up my phone at least), but IMO I’m well within my right to ignore their phone calls and I feel they should’ve just left me alone after the 2nd missed call so I could contact them when I had the time. Why Cindy would proceed to schedule me anyway and hope I somehow magically become aware (and was even available during this time in the first place) of the lesson is beyond me.

My dad is blaming me for this because “it’s my responsibility.” Well yeah, it IS my responsibility but how can I be expected to know about and show up to a lesson I never booked and never knew existed? Like I’ve been ignoring them for a reason. When the dentist calls to remind you you’re due for a cleaning and you don’t pick up your phone, they’re not just going to schedule you anyway and charge you the no show fee when you inevitably don’t show up. I feel for the driving instructor because he’s an innocent party in this, and I hope he still gets paid for his time, but I don’t see how this is my fault.

777,ESH,AITA for saying my having Autism (which I have) is not a disability?,"I was on an online Discord chatroom (yes, I know...) and someone asked me whether I was neuroatypical. The people involved were all relative strangers to me but to my understanding they know each other reasonably well, at least over Discord. I said I was, I have Autism, but I don't let it interfere with myself and I have turned down accommodations at school because I do not want them, I want to succeed or fail on the same rules as everyone else, and I do not want extra time or some such because that is unfair. I was told this was ""sad, and internalized ableism"".

I bristled a bit at that and said that I am not internalizing ableism because Autism is not a disability, I do not need accommodations, and it is my own problem if I'm unable to deal with it well enough, not the school's. Someone else (who also has Autism, though I didn't know that until slightly later) said ""Autism is a disability"". I found that offensive, and said as such, to which I was told ""I find it offensive that you refuse to acknowledge it as a disability."" I made a comment about how high-functioning Autism is not the same as severe Autism, and several people immediately jumped on me and said that those terms are ""total bullshit"" and ""not real"", and that they exist only because some people wanted an excuse to keep society just so or some such. It would likely have grown more heated but the server's moderators stepped in and put a halt to it at that moment.

I ultimately stand by my feelings. I am not disabled and I am doing just fine without extra assistance, and I am frustrated by the implication that because I have Autism I *need* extra help and refusing it means I'm internally self-loathing. However I am not certain if my behavior and responses were appropriate here. I can see how both sides could be seen as in the wrong here, even if my (highly biased) feeling is that I am correct.

778,ESH,AITA for refusing to switch around our wedding plans simply because my fiance liked everything at his sisters wedding?,"My fiance and I were due to be married at the beginning of this month but obviously due to life events, shit changed. My husbands sister did get married last week however and since then, my fiance has wanted to switch around all of our plans because he saw them at his sisters wedding and thought they were cool.

Our original plan was to have our two sons walk our rings down the aisle and have our daughter be the flower girl. We also had plans to have his band play at the wedding, where he intended to do a few sets. We were going to have almost 150 people attending. It was going to be a pot luck. I was going to have my brothers walk me down the aisle and have my sisters be brides maids. 

Now, since attending her wedding, he has decided that he wants our dog to walk the rings down the aisle because that is what his sister did and he thought it was awesome. He wants to rent a DJ, instead of have his band play because he liked the music played at his sisters wedding. He wants to cut back our guests from 150 to around 60 people instead because his sisters wedding was ""small and perfect"". He also wants to change our pot luck idea to a full caterer service because the food at his sisters wedding was ""delicious"". Now he doesnt want my brothers walking down the aisle because its ""too much"" (theres 4 of them).

All of this shit will not only cost us more money in the long run but.. this is not his sisters fucking wedding and I dont want to change shit around simply because he enjoyed himself at her wedding and thinks ours should be practically the same as hers. Hes mad at me saying that this is his wedding too and that I am ""cutting him out"". When in all actuality he was the one who made most of the plans for our original wedding idea and decided to switch it up simply after seeing his sisters wedding.

It was the first time I burped around her that day, and earlier that day my brother made a loud fart and all she said was say ""what was that?""

I then replied ""I'll do whatever the fuck I want"" and walked off before she could say anything.

I heard her say ""what did you say!?"" As I was walking off and next thing I know she got up and left the house to go to her appartment.

I typically go out of my way to avoid interactions with my sister but all I did was let out a burp.

780,ESH,AITA? Mom in the middle and son-in-Law suddenly starts treating me like poo on his shoe,"I recently was a guest of my eldest daughter (43 - hereinafter referred to as ED) - she got my plane ticket, and covered all of my eating-out expenses - after she invited me and I told her I had no traveling money - she was very insistent I come. After I consented to come, ED - despite my very known concerns about COVID (my lungs are compromised due to having survived hantavirus) - planned herself a fairly elaborate, maskless, afternoon birthday party for the day after I arrived (ED's actual birthday). ED and I drove over to Youngest daughter's (YD) house to surprise the grandbabies with ""Auntie's surprise birthday present"" - me. The grands were delighted, and asked if I could stay the night with them. I checked with ED who said she was okay with it. YD & I prepared a impromptu birthday celebration of ED's favorite Mom meal (literally hours of cooking) cupcakes, candles, etc. Afterwards, YD REMINDED ED she had a tattoo appointment day of the party (that had been scheduled 3 months prior) and that she would likely be late for ED's party, but would show up with bells on. ED acknowledged, stating perhaps YD's hubby & kids could come to the party on time, and YD could join later. YD acknowledged this as an idea. YD thought the party was at 2, it actually started at 1. Day of, I  accompanied YD to her appointment, and we impulsively got mother-daughter tats (very simple, about 15 mins each), thinking we'd still be only a little bit late to the party. Appointment ran WAY over expected time (11 - 2:30). About 2:15, YD's hubby got a PO'ed phone call from ED, asking why he wasn't there with the kids yet. Then YD got a nasty call from ED, too. YD's hubby gathered kids and ran to the party, YD & I went to her house to gather my luggage and phone and ran for the party. YD's hubby got lost on his way there, & YD & I ended up getting there before him. YD & I apologize profusely for being late, and YD for the time of the party mix-up on her part. ED was cold & distant to us all, including neices and nephew, throughout the party. She was also very distant towards me throughout the rest of my visit. ED's hubby, who has always been warm and very jokey with me, made several kind of mean comments at me throughout my visit; but I just treated them as jokey. I did ask him several times if he was angry with me throughout the week; but he never fully answered, said 'I'm angry at everyone!' , no more than that. But the last full day of my visit, he was especially nasty to me: ED asked him to pick up a pack of smokes for me while he was out, when she pointed out they were the wrong ones when he got back with them, he remarked 'maybe they'll kill her faster' which resulted in my spending the last day intermittently crying. It broke my heart! I was always so happy to spend time with them both prior to this. I don't understand - AITA?

781,ESH,AITA for smoking weed in my house where a baby lives with me?,"Sounds bad I know but hear me out. I (19F) live with my (19M) husband and another married couple (F32, M43) and we share a flat. When they moved in, there was no baby and they knew we smoked, they told us it was fine as they also smoked. They were also fine with our 2 cats so we thought, perfect. We can smoke without bothering our flatmates and they may even come and join us whenever they’re feeling it. Let’s call the wife Martina and the husband Jacob. Few months later, Martina told us she was pregnant and that she found out last month, but that she was too afraid to tell us because she was scared we’d move out. We did not want to live with a baby. We felt forced to accept it as we were in a tough situation. (Lockdown coming) From then on, our lives became harder. She would tell us we couldn’t smoke anymore in the house and that we would have to go out if we wanted to smoke. Overtime she told us we couldn’t have a cat litter box in the bathroom anymore as she is “sensitive” to smell (cat litter was cleaned every single day) so now we have the cat litter in our bedroom. I would hear her shouting and go to the living room to see one of my cats being scolded for sleeping in one of her baby beds in the living room. My cats were not free to do what they wanted anymore. Now the baby was born about two weeks ago. Since this, she’s been telling me to put my cats in my bedroom so that they are far away from the baby because he could inhale cat hairs. And we can only let them out when the baby isn’t in the living room. Today, we had our friend Cathy over. Martina and Jacob left the house with the baby and said they would be back later on. We started smoking in the living room. The cats were out playing. Martina and Jacob seem came home quite early. As we are smoking, she comes into the living room with the baby, seeing that we are clearly smoking and continues to do stuff in the kitchen before returning to her room. We finish up, and go to my room to chill there with my friend. I leave cats in the living room. Then I heard crying I went there to see if she took the baby back there when we had just smoked there. She sits there looking displeased with me as I walk in. Then she tells me to put the cats back in my bedroom as the baby is now there. She grabs all the cats toys aswell and shoves them in my bedroom. 
Good to keep in mind that her husband smokes cigarettes every 20 minutes or so 
and sometimes sneaks in to join us in smoking weed. She never tells him anything about him smoking.
M-  “don’t smoke in the living room again, This is the second time this happens”. 
Me- “you were out and said you’d be back later.”
M- “i had to go through living room with my baby, it’s horrible”
Me- “maybe you shouldn’t have walked in here with your baby knowing that we’re smoking.”, and walked off to my bedroom.

783,ESH,AITA for hating my husbands gaming habits,"Quick backstory - I am living in the UK from the states, I am a freelance graphic designer and my husband is a marketing officer. He has been furloughed since March/April, but we were basically evening out Money wise before then. He pays for our housing bills, I take care of anything else, because I get paid in dollars so it’s easier that way. When covid hit my business also was non-existent (so instead of getting paid 80% I was getting paid 0) so I had to use my cc, and have now gotten $7k in debt to have food in the house, etc. 

At the beginning of furlough he slowly got back into his gaming habit that he has pretty much abandoned since he was in his early twenties. To my belief, this was behind him when we first started dating so it was never an issue with us. A few months in it has become a huge part of his life again. 

I grew up with brothers so I understand the gaming life, but it was always when there was extra time, etc. it has now gotten to the point that we are working around his gaming schedule. It started off to where we couldn’t go to quiz nights because it was the same nights that he had his games set up. Of course since lockdown happened that hasn’t been an issue, but yesterday was thanksgiving and being away from my family on a family holiday is already hard, but he had to play his games all night because “he already committed to it”. I’m to the point now that I want him to just stop playing games in total but I know that is harsh. I know this is a tough time for him too being furloughed and not being social, but I’m just feeling like he could use this extra time to do something lucrative and maybe helping me get out of the $7k debt that we got into while I wasn’t working. I’m back to work now and working to bring that number down but it’s very annoying working from home and watching him just game ALL DAY!",2020-11-27 21:35:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k2a772/aita_for_hating_my_husbands_gaming_habits/,16,9,0.92,0
784,NAH,"AITA for saying ""I just hope that you are proud of yourself."" to my niece when I lost my job after she reported the company I worked for?","I(35F) lost my job after pandemic struck and found another working in a meat company. It was much lesser paid, more tiring and longer hours but beggars can't be choosers, I have 3 kids to raise and need a job or it would be too much for my husband to shoulder. I was going to continue to work there until I find a more suitable job because the boss of that company is quite an asshole.

Some time ago my niece(19F) was looking for a part-job and since there were vacancy in my workplace I recommended her to my superiors. My brother's family is quite wealthy, fully funding my niece's studies and living expenses and my niece only wanted a job for extra allowance. 

My niece soon found out that many of us working there are not paid the standard for over-time and our workload exceeding the norm. She was disgusted by the environment and wanted to file complaint about the company to the authorities. I begged her not to, not because of my love for the company(I was going to leave eventually), but because like me, many of us there have families to feed and needed the job.

My niece ignored me and ended up making quite a big deal out of it, posting pictures, videos and long paragraphs on social media and file some reports to ""fight for our rights"". I have no idea if it changed anything in the company. However, as a result of this drama, the company decided to dismiss a portion of its staffs, and including me, a few other coworkers of mine had lost their jobs. They did not voice it out directly but they have been avoiding me, probably blaming me for introducing my niece to the job.

I have been avoiding my niece too because, despite her good intentions, I still lost my job. My niece had been texting me giving all sorts of reasons that what she done was for what is right. When I ignored her texts, she sent more with long paragraphs basically wanting me to acknowledge that she is right. I really don't want to put blame or argue with a someone half my age still living in comfort with her parents, so in the end I replied ""I just hope that you are proud of yourself.""

My brother texted me later saying that I was being unkind to his daughter, that as her aunt who witnessed workplace toxicity with her I should encourage her to continue to fight for what is right(still going on between her and the company).

785,NAH,AITA for being completely honest to my biological parents about how my childhood was really awful?,"I was given up for adoption right after I was born.

Unfortunately my adoption didn't work out and I grew up in foster care until I turned 18.

I'm now 19 and in college. 

In February, I got a Facebook message from a man claiming to be my father. We messaged back and forth and while I kept a lot of my childhood details private, we did make plans to meet him and my mother. They weren't married to each other by the way.

When I got to the restaurant, I was very shocked and honestly upset to find my father and mother had brought their spouses, as well as their children to surprise me. My father's mother, so my grandmother was also there.

I was already feeling very emotional about the whole thing and seeing everyone there didn't help.

So I sat through an hour of listening to them sharing all about their lives while I fake smiled through everything. Honestly, I felt very jealous that they had kids they really loved and how they all had really happy lives after ditching me.

Then they started asking about me and my parents, and how my Facebook gave very little away about my life.

I basically lost it and started crying like a little bitch (lol) and told them how shitty my adoptive parents were and how shitty foster life was. 

I was pretty snarky and sarcastic when I said  that I'm glad their lives worked out for them because mine sure as hell didn't.

I couldn't stop crying and my father had to drop me back home. He was very apologetic.

I feel very shitty about it. I made my mother and father cry at the restaurant. They were really nice people. 

I got a few messages from my mother and father separately where they've been apologizing and if they could make it up to me.

My mother in particular seems really upset by everything and I hate that I may have messed up her happy life. Her last message basically said that she's been unable to sleep and wants to see me again.

I've been ignoring their messages and just been focusing on school instead.

786,NAH,AITA for telling my SO they don’t understand pregnancy,"Long time lurker here. 

I (28f) have been dating SO(26m) for about five years now. Got married once we both finished grad school last year, had all our friends at our wedding (pre covid) and have been floating on that honeymoon glow for a while now. 

We’ve always talked about having kids, but we have very different perceptions on the process of pregnancy.

Simply put, SO is TERRIFIED. When he was a new college student (like 18/19, so before I knew him) he had a horrible experience with kidney stones. No one in his family ever had one, and as a new student in a new place, he took it really bad. 

He spent a few nights in the hospital alone - his parents, now empty nesters, had flown overseas for a vacation and couldn’t get to the hospital (they still are incredibly apologetic to this day). 

He spent the first week of college in the hospital, hooked up to all kinds of pain meds and chugging water and sports drinks, all while convulsing and writhing in pain.

I guess this is a common saying, but apparently every nurse and doctor told him that passing a kidney stone was similar to giving birth. I guess being drugged up, loopy, and absolutely miserable in pain really worked that into his mind, and he has since been terrified of putting someone through that pain. 

We’ve talked about having children before, especially now that we’ve married, but he’s always been more inclined towards adoption. He doesn’t want me to go through the “mind shattering pain” of childbirth.

I disagree. My mother told me that her pregnancy to me was amazing. She felt an incredible bond with her unborn child, and said that pain didn’t factor in at all during the moment - she was just so happy that I came out alright. And, if the pain really was an issue, there are many other options that help the birthing process go smooth. 

I’ve explained this to my SO, and he was worried. Almost in tears, he explained that he couldn’t live with himself if he caused me to go through so much pain. I told him I would never hold something like that against him - having a child is of course a 50/50 decision. If I was worried about the pain I wouldn’t do it, but I’m not. He kinda shut down a bit, and said okay. We haven’t talked about children since.

787,NAH,AITA for refusing to take in my father's daughter?,"My father cheated on my mother and got another woman pregnant. Mom immediately filed for divorce. He went on to marry the other woman. My dad didn't have much custody of me when I was little. He was a nice and tried really hard but my mom was my primary custodian and there is nothing that I wouldn't do for her. I guess the fact that he always disrespects my mom, acts like she is the reason he cheated just made me hate him. My mother also strictly told my father that I am not to have any contact with his wife/child.

This happened when I was 5. I am now 20. Right now, I don't have any family except for my father, with whom I have cut all contact with (he didn't come to my mom's funeral and that was the last straw for me). Few months ago, my father's daughter, Tracy, contacted me. Turns out that she has lost both her parents to the pandemic. She was about to go into foster care and begged me to help her. 

I told her very politely that I do not want to have any contact with her and that she cannot possible expect me to take care of her when I am just a broke college student. She told me that she had plans and she would work and all I have to do is not let her go into foster home (she told me that she will take care of herself). She asked me to help her as I am her sister. As I mentioned, I have no clue about this person. I don't even know if what she was suggesting was legally possible. 

In the end, I told her that I wasn't in any position to help her and I don't know her. I told her that while we do have the same father, I don't consider him to be my father and I don't consider her to be my sister. I wished her luck but also firmly told her that I do not wish to have any contact with her. After that I ignored any attempt she made to contact me. 

She has recently started trying to contact me again. I had some glimpse at the messages and she alternates between calling me monster/heartless to how awful her foster home is. I haven't responded.

788,NAH,AITA For refusing to write a song for my unborn children despite writing one for my daughter?,"Eleven years ago I had a daughter. Me and my wife wrote her a song/rhyme, and its something very special to us. My wife passed away during childbirth, and so the song is something me and my daughter use to feel a lot closer to her. 

Three years ago I met a woman, who I am now engaged to. She's a wonderful woman, and seven months ago we decided we'd try for a baby (after discussing it with my daughter). She's now five months pregnant and we are having twins. 

She initially asked about a song for them, (she's heard me sing my daughter's song a lot), and I told her that I wouldn't because it was mine and my daughters thing, to be connected to her mother. She understood, but her family is still extremely upset about it. 

They were originally the ones who told my wife to ask about a song, and have not stopped badgering me about it. Continually telling me I'll have my twins growing up thinking they're unloved and that I love my daughter more than them, and that it's clear who my favourite child is. 

I think they're overreacting and don't think it will be that big of a thing. Plus, I wasn't even the one who wrote most of the song. I just sing it. 

My fiance is also concerned, and has asked me to not sing the song where the twins would hear, which I understand - but she doesn't want me to sing it if they're in the house at all, which I don't think is fair to my daughter. 

I don't think I'm the asshole. My fiance thinks she's being fair. Her family think I'm evil, and they're in the right.

789,NAH,AITA for pulling my kids out of public school?,"My kids school did not handle the transition to virtual learning well. We decided to try a “pod school” just for the sake of getting over this hump. 

It basically means they’re each in a class of five (my kid plus four of their peers.) 

We selected the other kids in the pod pretty carefully because we wanted the kids to have productive classmates who were there to learn. It worked out well. 

Then the pod schooling turned out to work significantly better than public schooling. They got twice the work done in half the time. They were actually enjoying their studies for once. 

So all the parents in the pod banded together and came up with the money to hire a permanent teacher in conjunction with a couple stay at home moms, and we unenrolled our kids from the public school. 

Our local public school isn’t that big, so it turns out that by removing so many of their top students (read: top standardized test takers), their budget has actually been noticeably impacted as well as their ranking in the district. 

The school has reached out and asked us to disband our pod so they can get the students back (and the teacher we hired) saying it is impacting students who remain at the school and the best students are now beginning to leave for their own pod structures, taking the better teachers with them. 

I’m kind of a community leader, I’ve got considerable sway over the community, so I’ve been asked to try and squash the pod trend, put my kids back in school, and stop this thing before it gets going any further. 

I really want my kids to get the best education they can, but I do have serious pause over doing so at the expense of the rest of the kids in town.

790,NAH,AITA for wanting to take care of my best friend’s children after she passed away?,"My best friend passed away unexpectedly nine months ago. It was not something that I ever thought would happen. She left behind 3 children, 8M, 4F and 1F.

My husband and I were written to be her children’s godparents. We have never wanted children of our own and do not have any, but we accepted the role of being godparents because we figured that it’s just a formality. Plus my best friend did not have many other people she could rely on. 

When she passed, her children were left without a mom or dad. The courts appointed her brother to be their guardian but he struggled a lot because he already had three children of his own to care for. After some time, he called me and said that he was going to transfer legal guardianship of the children to me per my best friend’s wishes.

I told him I wasn’t sure if I should or could be a parent to them. He said I should give it a try for a little while and see if it’s fine. He said my husband and I could probably provide a better home for them than he could at the moment. I was already very close to the children at that point so I agreed. 

My husband was not as close to them and was reluctant at first, he said he wasn’t sure if he could deal with the household size doubling overnight. Eventually he agreed to try it out.

The issue is that in the months since we’ve taken care of the kids, I have developed a strong bond with them but my husband has not. I never thought in my entire life that I would want children, and I still am not completely sure if I’d ever want biological children of my own, but I know that I want to keep being a parent to these kids specifically and that I’d be heartbroken if they left. 

My husband has more or less tried his best to deal with them but it’s just not working for him. He sees children as a chore and hasn’t developed a strong emotional connection with them like I have. When my best friend’s brother asked if he should start the paperwork to make me the official guardian, I had to give him a rain check. 

I want the children. My husband does not. He said he’s willing to take care of them on weekends or something but not be their permanent guardian. He said keeping the children would violate a pretty big part of our marriage, considering he has never wanted children and has even got a vasectomy to prevent them. 

I am torn. I love these children but I cannot think about sacrificing my husband either.",2020-11-19 10:43:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jx0jni/aita_for_wanting_to_take_care_of_my_best_friends/,561,3353,0.97,13
791,NAH,AITA for Refusing to Get Married for my Girlfriends Dying Mother?,"I(27M) have been with my GF(27F) since senior year of highschool. She didn't go to college so she just moved nearby to my university and we have stayed together. We currently live together.

Her mom has breast cancer and at most has a year left. I've tried supporting my girlfriend in her grieving process in whatever ways I can. When she went to go see her mother the other day, her mom said she was sad that she would never see us get married.

My GF came home and said we should get married I was like ""Are you proposing or something"" and she said no but she wants me to propose to her in the next few days.

It wasn't really a discussion more like ""this is what we're doing"". I don't feel ready for marriage, not in terms of our relationship, we've been together for nine years. But I'm 27, I know some people can get married at 27 but I want to be at least 30. I'm usually pretty chill with letting her make the big decisions but I just don't feel ready for marriage.

I was talking to one of my friends on facetime and his girlfriend chimed in and told me just to tell her how I feel, she may be upset but she would understand(She knows my GF). So Last night I told her how I'm not ready for marriage. I suggested other things like maybe a ""fake wedding"" where we don't actually sign the papers or maybe we could just have a big party for our 10th anniversary (Next month).

She got mad and told me it wouldn't change anything, it was just a dumb piece of paper. But it's more than that to me. First of all I want to have a nice wedding, not crazy or anything but decent which we have nowhere near the money for right now. Like where we are financially right now we would have to choose between a venue and crappy food or a backyard and a honeymoon at the local holiday inn. And also there's such a societal pressure when you get married to do things like have kids or something like that which I am nowhere near ready for.

My girlfriends really mad and she claims it's about her mother which it very much is not. It's about me. She told me to give her some space so I'm staying with my twin sister right now. But AITA here?

Edit: I 100% will marry her and I could never see myself with anyone else. But I just can't see myself getting married now. We have spoken about marriage and we've always said we wanted to be in our 30's, this came out of nowhere.

792,NAH,"AITA for wanting to get my work done on time rather than sit around talking about how """"""cute"""""" someone's kid is?","I'm 32F and work at company where I tend to be in the office with like 25 people every day. Rebecca in my office just came back from maternity leave. We all did the required song and dance about how we're ""so happy"" for her and all that sappy bullshit. 

I don't work very often with Rebecca but I'm depending on her for approval on a long-term project, so I went into her office to ask her for a timeline, since she's back (she's been back four weeks). Instead of talking to me about the project, she started showing me baby pictures.

I kept saying ""Hey so about the project"" and ""That's great, I'm so happy for you, but can we get back to the project?"" and stuff like that. She just kept shoving pictures of her kid at me. Eventually someone else came in and the whole thing started up again.

Finally done with the dog and pony show, I stood up and said ""Hey Rebecca, I'm kind of waiting on you for final approval on this marketing push. Can we please get back to work?""

She started to fucking cry and ran out of the office yelling about how I'm so mean and how hard it is to be away from her baby and can I please just give her a break. I'm just stood there like... what the fuck dude. The woman who came in and interrupted us is glaring at me all meanly and said ""Wow, I bet you're real proud of yourself.""

I was just like ""I'm here to get my job done, not look at picture's of someone's kid."" She sneered at me and stomped off and complained to my boss, who said I should try to be more understanding and compassionate.

793,NAH,AITA for refusing to have any contact with my late husband's affair child?,"This is a long story. So buckle up. 7 years ago, my husband passed away. Few months after he passed away, a 15 year old teenager came to my house. 

She revealed that she was his daughter. His name isn't in her birth certificate but he really stepped up after he found that her mom died when she was 10. She went to live with her grandmother and my husband paid her grandmother each month to help with the expenses. 

After my husband died, the payments stopped and her grandmother threw her out. After being homeless for a couple of weeks, she came to my house. 

This was a pretty big shock to me and I cannot stress how much I didn't want this person in my house. At the same time, I couldn't leave a child homeless. So I told her that I would help her and give her a place to stay. I also warned her that I only want to help her out and that I am not taking any maternal role and she shouldn't expect me to. She agreed. 

She stayed at my house from the years of 15-18. My kid had already gone off to college and I didn't mind. I never acted on the resentment I felt but at the same time I refused to do anything that could be considered ""parent-like"". (I pretty much only provided her with food and gave her a place to stay. That's it.) 

She left when she was 18. I didn't have any contact with her after she left. She is now 20 and she contacted me recently. She wanted to connect and she told me that I am the only mother figure she has. She wanted to bond with me and she wanted me to consider her a daughter to me. 

After some contemplation, I reminded her that it wasn't a role I was willing to take and that it was something I warned about very early on. I helped her because she needed it, not because I loved her. She cried and told me that it wasn't fair and I wasn't giving her a chance. The thing is I don't think I have to.( I have tried refusing politely but she keeps pushing this and I am about to block her everywhere. ) 

My kid (who has always refused to even talk to the girl) thinks I am right. My friends are divided on this issue.

794,NAH,AITA for insulting my roommate’s “cultural heritage”?,"Throwaway, also I’m on mobile. 

This happened a few weeks ago but my roommate is still acting a bit weird. As background, I (22f) was born in Italy but moved to the US when I was an infant. I visit occasionally with my family but not regularly. I don’t even speak great Italian. However, my cousin is getting married, and ordinarily I would attend, but due to the pandemic it would be logistically difficult and IMO irresponsible to enter the country.

 I found out that my grandmother had planned to take some photos of all my cousins and me in these traditional outfits while we were all in one place. She decided that since we wouldn’t be there, she wanted pictures of my sister and I sent to her instead. When I got the outfit I was excited because it was fancy and I tried it on at home almost immediately. 

My roommate (22f) saw me in the outfit (long skirt, jewelry, head scarf, etc.) and immediately blew up at me for “treating the g*psy culture like a costume”. I think I might be the AH because it was shortly before Halloween and I knew she was saying this because we had had a conversation about inappropriate costumes (mostly blackface) but I was so mad at what she was saying that I responded something like “just because your only cultural heritage is colonialism doesn’t mean the rest of us can’t be proud.” 

When she realized what I meant she apologized and left but I could tell she was hurt and it’s been a little awkward since then. So idk, AITA?

795,NAH,AITA for being done with my daughters?,"I am a 52 year old male. I got a my ex-wife, Maggie pregnant, when we were in our last year of college. We were both from conservative families so we got married. From our marriage I gained two daughters, Jenny (age30), and Cassie (aged 27).

My wife and I were not a great couple. We got married way too young, and grew apart. She became more religious as we got older, and I became less religious. She also was always angry at me for something or the other. My political beliefs shifted to be more liberal, and my wife became  more conservative. We did our best to not fight in front of the kids, but our arguments were loud, and could be heard through the walls.

Twelve years ago, I found out Maggie was having an affair. Jenny was 17, and going to college soon, while Cassie was still in high school. Maggie’s family had set up a trust fund for the girl’s education, and Maggie and I kept separate finances so the money part of the divorce was easy. Custody of Cassie was a fight, and my ex-wife claimed I was abusive.

 Because our fights were noisy, the girls believed her, and over the next year cut me off.  My attorney told me that because of the girls ages, the Courts wouldn’t force visitation I kept the lines of communication open, but they cut me out of their lives. I was heartbroken. I sank into a depression. Over time I rationalized that the girls were adults, and that I had done my duty to them.

My sister has a relationship with them, and through her, I have learned that both of them got married, and that Jessica had two children. I’ve heard that their relationship is strained with their mother as she hated their husbands, and refused to attend Cassie’s wedding. 

The girls both want to try to reconcile with me. I think that they’ve realized that I wasn’t the villain that my ex-wife painted me to be. I’m done though. Losing them was incredibly painful. I hurt for a long time, and missing their weddings, and the birth of my grandchild. Since my divorce I have refused to get too close to anyone new, and I don’t want to rely on anyone. I’m not on social media, and I screen my calls on my personal phone. The girls have tried to call, but I’ve blocked their numbers. I use email strictly for professional reasons and I don’t do Facebook. My sister is giving me a hard time for not wanting to reconnect because she says that the girls were kids, and didn’t know what my ex was like. I don’t think I have it in me to let anyone in again.

796,NAH,AITA for wanting my(30M) hypothetical children to have my last name and not my wife’s(31F)?,"I’ve been married to Dana for 6 years. Me and her both want to have kids and we’ve been trying to get things in order before we actually start trying for a baby instead of just practicing. When me and Dana got married, she decided that she didn’t want to change her last name to my name. I’m not gonna lie, it was a little bit of a controversy. I’m pretty traditional about that and it kinda threw me off.

When we first began talking about kids almost 2 years ago, I asked about the last name thing. She said that she didn’t care because it wasn’t that important to her. I took that as her she was okay with me decided our kids last name. 

A few weeks ago, we were talking about it again and we began talking about potential names. I said a name that I think would pair really well with my last name. She was confused and asked why I was so sure that they’d have my name. I said because she said she didn’t care. She that does not care but she thinks it’d be weird for the children that come out of her body to not her her last name. 

I told her that this is really important to me and that it felt like if the children didn’t have my name, it’s like they’re less connected to me. She asked if she wasn’t as connected to me because she doesn’t have my last name. I said that she couldn’t understand what I feel. Because really she can’t. This is gonna sound dumb but when a woman has a kid, they carry the child and birth them. I feel like the only way I can have level of connection between a mother and her child do with my child is if I give them my last name. Again I know it’s stupid but its how I feel.

I told Dana all of this and she got upset with me. She said that it’s disgusting that I felt like the children weren’t mine if they didn’t have my last name, which isn’t at all what I said. We argued for a little bit and we never resolved this.

797,NAH,AITA for wanting my girlfriend to sign a contract/agreement before moving into my flat?,"Hi - somewhat concerned that I am being an ass here.

&#x200B;

I'm about to buy a new flat. I'm putting all the money I have into it, and a large portion is inheritance from my recently late dad - so this is very important to me, and/because it was to him.

I've been with my girlfriend for a year, and we've talked about moving in together soon (although we're in no rush). However, my dad wanted me to (and I think it is a good idea) have whoever moved in sign an agreement to say that I own the house 100% and that they can't claim a stake in the house. This wouldn't have just applied to my current girlfriend, he wanted (and I agree) me to do it if I moved in with a friend, a spouse or even just some random.

This makes my girlfriend feel uncomfortable - she thinks I'm accusing her of being in it for the money, which I am absolutely not, and I have tried to make clear to her. She is concerned about my ability to kick her out on the street at a moment's notice, even though I've told her I wouldn't do that - but obviously my claim that I won't do that is the same as her claim that she wouldn't try to take half the house. I'm looking into making it more secure for her in this signed agreement, but signing anything would make her feel uncomfortable.

I think she is worried about the idea of me being her 'landlord', even though I've made it explicitly clear that I wouldn't accept rent from her (which she agrees with).

Also, supplementary AITA - she's mentioned that she might not be comfortable living in a house that I own at all. Would I be an ass if I refused to move to rent in the same city just because she doesn't want to live in my flat? Renting would cost more than my mortgage and obviously the money wouldn't go anywhere.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - I own flat. Want GF to move in. Want her to sign agreement saying I own the flat and she has no interest in it (not uncommon in the UK). AITA?

798,NAH,WIBTA if I tell my mom her husband is the reason I decided to live with my dad?,"TLDR: My parents divorced when I was 2 and my mom married her husband when I was 6. Custody between my parents was 50:50 until last year when I (16f now) decided I wanted to live solely with my dad. The reason I made the choice was my moms husband. It's the same reason my brother has very minimal contact with my mom today (he's 20m). My mom wants to know why I chose to see her and her husband so little. Would I be the asshole to say he's the reason?

Long version: My parents divorced when I was 2 and my mom met her husband when I was 5 and my brother was 9. He was alright at first and then, once he and my mom got married, he become this really overbearing and jealous person who competed with our dad for the title of dad. He asked us twice to call him dad. The day after the wedding and then four years later on his birthday. Both times he got upset when we said no. The few times I talked about something I did with my dad he would jump in to suggest we should do it together which made me not want to talk about it. Other times, like one year Father's Day was coming up, and my brother gave me some money so we could buy our dad a gift. Our mom and her husband were asking what we were buying and my brother told them and things got awkward, her husband walked off and she asked if we were getting two father's day gifts or just the one. My brother asked her why it was important and she said she was just curious. Later that day we got back and my mom's husband said it hurt his feelings that we would buy a gift for our dad when we were with him.

There was one year my school had this dumb father daughter dance. My dad and I both agreed it was dumb and we decided to go see a movie, grab some food and make a fun night out of it instead of the dance. My mom's husband had asked me to go with him before and I turned him down, and then he was hurt that instead of going to the dance with him, I chose to skip the dance with my dad.

We had numerous things like that over the years. It drove my brother far away and he doesn't really speak to our mom anymore and has not seen either of them since he moved out for college. I moved in with my dad but never told my mom why. Mostly because I know she will take his side. Now she's asking for total honesty.

799,NAH,AITA For wanting my girlfriend to tell her subscribers about me?,"So I started dating my girlfriend around a year ago. We’re both 23, I just started a job recently and my girlfriend does Youtube full time as her job. I won’t say too much, but she has around 1.5 million subscribers and she plays games on her channel. Her income mostly depends on how many views she gets and how many people donate money when she streams.

So the other day she was talking about a creepy guy in her comments begging her on a date and I jokingly said “Well, did you tell him that you’ll sick your boyfriend on him?”

She sort of laughed and said, “No, my YouTube personality always remains single.”

I had never heard this before, so after asking her about it I basically learned that her entire following doesn’t know she has a boyfriend and she’s never even mentioned me. Now, I know this isn’t a matter of privacy because she’s talked about her friends in detail on her channel before.

Honestly, I’m a little offended. I didn’t know she was doing this and thought that her subscribers were at least aware of me. We got into an argument about it and while I know she makes her money from this, I feel like she hid from me that her Internet personality is always single. AITA for wanting her to tell her subscribers?

Edit:

So we had a discussion about it. I told her it bothered me that she hadn’t told me about this earlier and she admitted she had kept it hush for a while because it was a straining thing in her last relationship too. I apologized and told her I didn’t want her income ruined, which she accepted and said that she’d be more open about her YouTube channel with me. I get her in real life so that’s all that matters to me.

AITA /WIBTA for not wanting to follow these new rules given by my kids’ teacher and complaining to the principal?

I have 4 year old twins in preschool. It is a small school so there is only one preschool class and they are in it together. 


They are not identical twins but they look similar and people get them confused. 


We got an email from school telling us the twins can no longer wear matching masks and clothes.


Getting dressed and masked is a battle for us. We found that they did better when we let them choose. They don’t always choose to match hut sometimes they like to. 


Since getting that email, I’ve been telling them not to match but the other day they were being difficult and I had a migraine so I didn’t say anything when they wore the same outfit and mask. 


I got a note sent home saying next time the boys are matching, one will be changed in to their spare outfit. They took one of the masks away and gave them a school one to wear—which my boys hate because they are thick and don’t have adjustable straps. 


They were very upset about having one of the masks taken away. 


I haven’t responded to the note but I’m honestly thinking of emailing the principal and saying this is getting ridiculous. Why does it matter what they wear? Put a name tag on them, realize they have different hair cuts, and heights, and shapes, AND they have different colored shoes that they wear every single day with their first initial on the back to signify who is who.

801,NAH,AITA for buying my dream engagement ring behind my fiancé’s back?,"My fiancé is a simple guy with simple tastes. So when it came time to ordering a ring, he did the most him thing that he could do. He proposed to me with a empty box and a sticky note that had the address to a high end store. He told me he wanted me to design my ring. Due to the virus, we had to do it online instead of in store. He gave me a budget and told me to get what I want. I offered to pay for part, he said no. 

So I designed the dream ring I wanted. The problem is, it’s a grand over budget (barely, it’s like $789). My dad had given me a large check for my birthday because my fiancé and I had both been laid off for covid, and while he got a new job, I have been struggling to find a job in my field. He gave me the money for a dress for the wedding and just to help financially. I took a grand from the money he gave and used it towards the ring. I didn’t tell my dad what I used the money for and he doesn’t care. He just wanted to contribute anyway he could. 

I was struggling to design a ring without having professional help and my fiancé didn’t want to help. Certain stones can’t go with certain bands and yada yada. So when I finally designed a ring I liked, that was compatible, and stayed mostly within budget, I was really excited. I ordered the ring and told him. I told him a went a little over budget but had enough to cover the difference and he got really upset that I didn’t check with him. I told him I could afford the extra and he said that wasn’t the point. I told him that the point was for me to be happy and I was happy.

802,NAH,AITA for telling my parents I'd rather call off my wedding than have them there?,"Obligatory Throwaway, family knows my real account. 

My parents and I have never had a great relationship. I had very few friends when I was younger as they were so possessive and picky when it came to what kids I was allowed to interact with. I wasn't allowed to have any say in how I looked either. I had always been jealous of people with long hair but because my parents thought that it wasn't ""manly"" I was stuck with a buzz cut. I was judged about everything from the way I looked, how I acted, what my interests were etc. My sister also had to deal with this, though not to the extent I had to as she was their first born (the child they'd planned).

This all led to me leaving home when I was 16. Ten years on I am living with my soon to be husband and our 4 year old son and everything seems to be going absolutely great. We had planned to have our wedding next summer but we might have to postpone it due to the pandemic.

In the past 3/4 years my parents have been trying to worm their way back into my life. My sister has forgiven them and they appear to be pretty good with her children but I haven't forgiven them.  I do not want them anywhere near my child. They had asked to video call my son a couple months ago but I opted out last minute. Our son has been going through a phase where his favourite colour changes a lot. Currently his favourite colour is pink. He has been wearing a lot of pink t shirts because of this.  I know my parents will see this as feminine and I don't want this little 4 year old boy having to listen to all the stuff I had to deal with.

They have been more persistent lately about meeting their grandson which I have tried to avoid talking about. Eventually I asked them why they cared so much about meeting my son now (they didn't even make this much effort when we first brought him home) and they said that they'd like to meet their grandson before the wedding, so he didn't think they were strangers. They want to bond with him before the big day. But they aren't invited. I don't want them there. 

We're not having a big wedding and I am not willing to cut people I genuinely care about out of the guest list so my parents can take their place. Besides, my fiance and I aren't really sure we want them around our family. I told them as much and when they argued back, I snapped that I'd rather call the wedding off than have them there. 

However, I learned later that my sister has apparently been giving them false hope that they can come to the wedding, they even picked out their outfits for it.

803,NAH,AITA for telling my sister she can't bring her girlfriend to my wedding.,"Background- I'm (26 F) and my sister (22F) is a lesbian and our whole family is very traditional. The only reason I know about her sexual preference is I ran into her on a date with her girlfriend and well have been covering for her ever since. Well, the 2020 plague happened this year so we moved our wedding from  May to the first week of December. We are having the wedding now since my fiance has grandparents that aren't going well and want to have the wedding when they are still alive.

So the wedding is really small, just close family and very close friends. Any other friends or extending family will be watching with a zoom meeting. Well, my sister told me that she is gonna bring her girlfriend. I told her no unless she is going to lie to everyone about their relationship. That she can't come out to the family at my wedding because it will turn into a shit show. My family was angry at me for not having the wedding in a church (there still salty over that). I know how this whole thing will end with a giant argument and probably with someone tackling someone else.

She called me a homophobic asshole and I'm sticking with what I said. SO AITA",2020-11-23 20:33:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jzpuc4/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_cant_bring_her/,210,1067,0.94,0
804,NAH,AITA for telling my wife she's not the only woman in the world to ever have a baby?,"As you can probably guess, this is our first child. We're both excited, but I think my wife sometimes goes overboard and beyond what's normal. I hate to use the word pretentious, but a lot of what she does and says seems that way. Sometimes it seems like she thinks she's the only woman ever to have a baby, and that makes this experience a lot less enjoyable. The amount of pressure she puts on us and the significance she attaches to everything sucks the joy out of being an expectant parent. It also makes her hard to be around sometimes because of how demanding she can be and how nothing every seems to be good enough for her.

I did try talking to her about everting I've mentioned, but it did no good. She just didn't understand what I was trying to say. I don't know if she was being willfully ignorant or honestly didn't understand it, but I tried several different ways.  I finally told her that she needed to lighten up and learn not to make everything so difficult because it's not rocket science and many woman have had and raised babies successfully without making it this hard.

She didn't like that I told her this, but I think she needed to hear it. Ordinarily I'd listen if she told me I was the asshole, but lately her judgment has been off so I think she's wrong in this case. AITA?

&#x200B;

Adding examples:

Planning the nursery has been awful. She never listens to my suggestions and dismisses my ideas as dumb, yet she can never decided what she wants. I've already painted the nursery twice. I tell her that the color doesn't matter, but she believes it does. She seems to get easily hung up on details like that such as paint color and carpeting. 

We did a maternity shoot, and nothing was right. The session was supposed to take 1-2 hours. Instead it took three because of how many reshoots she had us do. 

She never takes advice or input from others. I will send her an article or point out something to her, and she'll dismiss it because ""a mother knows.""

She says a lot of things which make it clear she doesn't believe I am really doing anything important. I know I have a support role, but she makes it clear exactly how little she thinks I matter in this all. That sort of leads into another issue which is how she tends to make a lot of underhanded insults about how I don't understand anything because I am the dad.

806,NAH,AITA for telling my husband to stop saying to our 2.5yo she is making him sad?,"Husband is away working, he's been gone well over a month and won't be home for another month. This length of time isn't normal, but he does travel quite a bit regularly. He was home for about 8 months during Covid, when travel was restricted.

We video chat 2x a day and the last week or so our 2.5yo hasn't had interest in talking to him, she will say, ""no, I don't want to talk to Dada!!"" Then start being fussy. (Let's call her B). Every time, my husband will say, ""aw, B, talk to Dada, you're making me sad."" 

Today he said it and I said, ""stop telling her that she is making you sad, you are an adult who understands the situation. You telling her that she is making you sad is NOT fair. She doesn't understand why you have been away so long, and will be happy to see you when you get home.""

He got real quiet and I tried to re-explain, but he just said his goodbyes and hung up.

B is very much a Daddy's girl and when he is home she is all about Dada and not so much Mama. I just don't think it's fair for him to project those feelings onto her. 

Obviously it sucks and it must be hard for him to be away from his family for so long, but it's a part of our life and him telling B that SHE is making him sad doesn't seem right to me. 

AITA for telling my husband to stop telling my 2.5yo she's making him sad?


Edit: thanks for the feedback everyone. We called him back just now and I asked her to show him a new toy she got yesterday, which she did and talked to him about it. I apologized to him for the way I said what I said and asked if we could rephrase the way he tells her he is sad, which he agreed with. We have a strong family and I think these times are hard on all of us. Thanks again!

Edit 2: Well it seems the votes are divided. I appreciate everyone's input (especially the people that gave me advice on how to engage with the video calls).  Otherwise, I did not expect this to get so much attention and through all this, hubby and I are on the same page.

807,NAH,AITA for proving to my wife that I don't need her in order for our household to function smoothly?,"Her sister recently gave birth to twins. Her labor was difficult, so she asked my wife to come and help her for a week or two while she recovered. 

A bit of background about us. My wife and I have three kids of our own, and she is a stay at home mom. A lot of things around the house fall on her, but that doesn't mean I don't know how to do everything she does or take care of our kids. I can if I need to do it because I had to do it all by myself, with the exception of taking care of the kids, when I lived alone. 

My wife was very nervous about going away for so long. Partly it was because she'd never been away from our kids for so long, but she also worried about how I would do alone with our kids for a week or two. I had no concerns, but she seemed to think I would be helpless and couldn't manage alone. She kept asking me if we would be alright even as she was leaving. 

Honestly I was pretty offended. I consider myself extremely independent and capable. I also had no idea she thought I was so incompetent and unable to manage without her, like I am just another one of the kids even though I clean up after myself and handle most of my personal needs. I decided that I would double my efforts while she was gone to show her that I can manage everything fine by myself. 

The kids had a great time and were telling their mom how much they enjoyed our week and a half and how much they wished things were always like this. The house looked great and was spotless from top to bottom. I even managed to find time to get a few projects done around the house. 

I thought my wife would be proud and happy that things went so well, but she seemed disappointed. That only seemed to get worse over the next week, but she told me she was fine. I finally started to wonder if it wasn't something I did but was something that happened while she was away. I contacted my BIL and SIL, and my SIL told me that my wife was hurt because she felt like our family didn't need her and didn't miss her. 

My SIL thinks I did too much and should have not tried so hard to show my wife that I can do everything without her.

808,NAH,AITA for splitting my will unequally?,"Throwaway for normal reasons blah blah blah.

My wife (60F) and I (61 M) have four children: lets call the Matt (35 M), Mary (35 F), Paul (32 M) and Jake (30M). We also have 7 grandchildren ranging in age from 10-2 (Matt has 1 kid, Paul has 2 kids, Jake has 4) . Even though my wife and I are both fairly healthy, in light of the current world situation we decided to update our will. Initially we just wanted to split everything equally between all of our descendants, but recently we've been talking about doing something a little different.

The first major change is that we want to leave the majority to our grandchildren. Our children are all grown and established but the future is uncertain for young people these days so we want to help our grandbabies have the best foot forward. We plan to leave about 70% of everything to be split equally for our grandchildren, put into individual trusts that they can access when they're 18.

Now here's the tricky part (sorry if this is long): Our relationships with our children are not equal, and so we do not think their stake in our will should be either. Our relationship with Matt is very strained. We try to reach out to him at least once a month but he barely makes an effort back. He sees us maybe twice a year even though he lives closest to us (about 30 mins). On the other hand we are very close with Mary. She lives 3 hours from us but she and her wife make an effort to video call every few weeks, even more once the pandemic began. She's always checking up on us and helping us out. We are also very close to Paul.. He lives about an hour from us but before the pandemic he would drive up with the kids every other weekend; now we videochat. He helps me out with projects around the house and he we know we can call him for anything. Jake was our problem child. He's mostly turned his life around now but I feel that he tends to take advantage of us. He only calls when he needs something, uses my wife for free babysitting w/o saying thank you, and a few months ago my wife had a health scare and he was the only child to not reach out. He also lives only about an hour away but pretty much only comes over to drop the kids off.

So this is what we want to do: We want to split the remaining 30% between our children unequally. We want to give Paul 10%, Mary 10% and Jake and Matt both 5%. Our reasoning is that Paul and Mary have done more to take care of us so we want to take care of them.

Naturally Jake and Matt are not happy about this at all. Matt thinks everything should be split perfectly evenly like we originally intended and Jake thinks that the split should be based on need (and since he has the most kids he probably needs more), but I firmly disagree. I think we should be able to split our money however we like.

I don’t like traditional rings and I picked out a ring with a different stone, not a diamond that was priced at $149. This is NOT a money issue. He has a great job and makes plenty of money or I wouldn’t ask him at all. The thing is - he didn’t get me that ring. He made one himself. I do love that he spent time making this ring, BUT the little rhinestones keep falling off (they’re superglued on) and he has to repair it. It isn’t made of metal, so I can’t get it wet and I’m super paranoid about breaking the big stone. It just kind of makes me feel like I wasn’t even worth $150 out of one paycheck. I’ve seen ring posts on here where the woman wants something outrageous, but I wasn’t asking for much I don’t think. I don’t wear my ring all the time simply because it breaks and the stones fall out it definitely will not last.

810,NAH,WIBTA if I announce my pregnancy at Christmas?,"Hi Reddit! 

My husband and I recently found out we’re pregnant and will be about 11 weeks at Christmas.  My husband and I are only children but have large families. This year, we’ll be traveling (by car) to his family for Christmas (I have hesitancies about doing this before this but I’ve been assured it will be a ""small gathering less than 15 people"") and my husband says this will be a perfect time to announce our pregnancy and he “has been dreaming of doing a big announcement” his whole life.  He wants to wrap up onesies and give them to everyone at the same time. 

I’m all for supporting him telling his family however he wants to, and his parents and grandparents will be thrilled as this will be the first grandchild in the family. However, I have grave concerns about doing this because his cousin (who I suspect will be at Christmas) just shared with me that she had a miscarriage last week.  It wasn’t widely known she was pregnant (and I haven't told her I'm pregnant yet), but I think we’d be terrible people if we start flouncing our pregnancy around her.  I’ve also pointed out to my husband that 11 weeks is still really early and the chance is there for us to miscarry as well.  He argues that we won’t get a chance to do this again and we should tell his cousin our plan ahead of time so she’s not taken by surprise and can prepare, but I don’t think a woman can really mentally prepare for that and I don’t want to do that to her. 

So Reddit, WIBTA if we announced our pregnancy at Christmas?

&#x200B;

Edit about the onesies: He wants to hand out two gifts, one to his parents that say ""favorite grandchild"" (my husband is an only child and this is our first baby) and ""baby's first christmas"" to his grandparents (same grandparents of his cousin) with an ultrasound photo.  Cousin wouldn't be getting a gift, but she I think she'll be there, so my concerns are still the same.

&#x200B;

Edit #2: I posted this below, but we have actual Christmas gifts planned for everyone as well. I think he is thinking of this along the lines of ""oh, so and so, it looks like you forgot a gift"" scenario.

I'm really not picky on the ""gift"" of what we're tentatively giving his family...I could care less about that. I'm worried that announcing this at Christmas with other family will cause my cousin-in-law unneeded pain of her miscarriage from last week. My husband's argument is essentially 'no time is the right time' and as long as we privately tell her ahead of time then any announcement is fine.

My friends told me some random guy came over with him and said in English ""hey this is my foreign exchange partner Ivan and he's pissing me off so I'm going ot leave him with you"" and they then said some shit in Russian and he left. He doesn't know a word of English, so my friends are freaking out. I come out and they told me what happened. I talk to him and he explains to me that his friend said we were supposed to take him home and that he knew us. I explained to him we have no idea wtf is happening. 

At this point we're looking around for cameras, this has to be a prank, I saw this exact same thing with a Spanish and Moroccan exchange student on youtube.

816,NAH,AITA for resenting my sister for becoming my “parent”?,"My sister (F25) and I (M21) had one of the worst sibling relationships when growing up. My parents immigrated to America but struggled financially in the beginning. They had to work multiple jobs, leaving them out of the house day and night almost everyday. My sister and I stayed at home alone ever since I was 5 years old because we couldn’t afford a babysitter and we had no relatives to take care of us since they all lived back in my home country. My sister had to pick up a role more of like a guardian to me rather than being an actual sister while growing up.

Needless to say, she has done an awful job as you’d expect a child trying to be a guardian. She scolded me for the wrong reasons and tried to lecture me life lessons that didn’t make sense. I cried a lot as I grew up because of this. But no matter how painful it was, I sucked it up because I knew that both of us were dealt a crappy hand in our early lives. However, I can’t say that this upbringing hasn’t negatively impacted our relationship.

Fast forward to my teenage years, my parents are doing better financially and my mother started to stay home more while my dad provided for the family on his own. This is where I started to tell my parents about my crappy childhood and my mom broke down in tears when I basically told them that I kind of hate my sister. My parents said they had no idea and that they’re sorry for all the neglect I felt as a kid and that it’s their fault I don’t have a nice relationship with my sister. All of this is true, but I accepted their apology and I was able to rekindle my relationship with my parents pretty easily.

This interaction I had with my parents was nice and it gave me hope to maybe fix my relationship with my sister this time. When I was 16 years old, I started to initiate conversations about how I wanted our relationship to be better. This was on multiple occasions, but my sister turned me down every time. I fear that our upbringing shaped her to see me not as a younger brother but as someone she constantly needs to educate, so she often disregards what I have to say. 

My last straw with my sister was when I was 18, she had just graduated college and moved out of our house. I helped her move into her apartment, but I brought my friends without telling her just so that we could help her move in easier. She threw a tantrum when we got there saying “you never know from right and wrong.” She yelled at my friends while they stood there silent. She embarrassed me and called me “a sh\*tty brother.” Now, every time I think of our relationship it takes a heavy toll on my mental health. This was the last interaction I had with my sister and I haven’t had a conversation with her ever since. I am very discouraged to reach out to her ever again, and I feel that I shouldn’t until I get an apology for all the pain she caused in my life. My parents know of this and yet they want me to reach out to her.

817,NAH,WIBTA if I didn't give my stepson his own room?,"I saw a post on here yesterday that had me questioning if I am being an asshole or not. 

I am 8 months pregnant with a little girl, I have a 2 year old son, and a 9 year old step son. My husband and I are looking for a new place to live so we can accommodate the newest addition to our family! We currently live in a 2 bedroom apartment, my stepson and bio son share a room here (we have lived here for the past 3 years). I have been looking for a 4 bedroom house, but we live in a rather expensive state so 3 bedrooms just works with our budget better. My step son's mother lives 4 hours away from us, so we only have him two weekends a month, a total of four nights with exceptions for school breaks, like this week for instance is his Thanksgiving break, so we had him the entire week. 

My husband and I were talking about the move and he said ""It will be nice for O (stepson) to have his own room!"" I responded with ""Yeah if we get a 4 bedroom house."" My husband looked at me kind of funny and said ""Even if it's only a 3 bedroom O should have his own room, the younger kids can share a room. That's just how it works."" I was a little surprised by this because we only have O 4 nights a month. I think it's a little absurd to expect our son and newborn daughter to share bedrooms just to have an empty room sit around, unlived in, 90% of the time. I have been prioritizing a 4 bedroom place, as I would love for O to have a personalized room he feels welcome in when he is with us. I just feel that if we can't find one and settle with a 3 bedroom, then it's unrealistic to have both our bio children share a room, when unfortunately we don't even see O that often, whereas our bio children would obviously be living with us 100% of the time. 

I tried to explain this to my husband but he basically said in so many words that I am being an asshole and showing favoritism. I thought I was thinking logically about utilizing our living space, but maybe I'm being an asshole?

EDIT: Kind of sad I have to edit this in, but I would like to point out that I absolutely love my stepson. I have been in his life almost 8 years now, we are extremely close and open with each other. There is no animosity between me, him, his mother, or his father. We are one big family unit that has never had issues. I would never compromise his happiness or comfort and if he had ever openly expressed to me that sharing a room is a huge problem for him, I would try my damndest to work something out. But, that's not the case. I posted this because of his father's reaction, not because of anything he has personally said on the matter.

SECOND EDIT: I've said it a few times in the comments, so it might be worth mentioning that we are looking for a home to rent for the next 3 years max. By then we should have enough saved to buy a house, and I would never buy a house that didn't accommodate ALL my children perfectly. Also, I did sit down and talk with my stepson this morning about sharing a room. Basically he said he has never been bothered about sharing a room, they don't spend a ton of time in there anyways. Having his own room sounds nice, he said, but it's not a big deal if he has to share. (Humble beginnings definitely breed humble kids.) When I mentioned him having his own basement with a gaming/LEGO area his eyes lit up, he really loved the sound of that and hearing him express that verbally made his dad more comfortable with the idea of a basement as well! Plus, that fits into our budget way better than a 4th bedroom (houses are priced so weird)!

We haven't had a super easy life to start, moving into a 2 bedroom apartment when he was 5/6 was a huge improvement from our last situation. I was the breadwinner for a very long time and I would hardly call what I made ""decent bread"". My husband has since found a really reliable, steady, and well paying job, and I have gone to school and started working towards my dream job, allowing us to better save for a forever home. Thank you for all the responses, it seems pretty divided down the middle, which I get, that's why I posted here in the first place, the situation has me pretty torn.",2020-11-27 05:49:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k1vf9y/wibta_if_i_didnt_give_my_stepson_his_own_room/,142,155,0.93,0
818,NAH,AITA for leaving the room without a word after my fiancé proposed?,"I am 26F / He is 26M. We’ve been together for 3 years.

We’ve been actively discussing future life plans. We always wanted the same things in life, and we agreed on most of the topics and decisions.

One of the things we discussed a year ago was ideas about how he wanted to propose. He talked about a proposal in the mountains, or in a forest; something outdoors, simple but romantic to us. I was very happy and excited, not to mention we live between mountains and forests so it was also easily accessible.

We have been discussing this many times, even dropping ideas of which mountain would be the most romantic (we hike together, so we thought the very first mountain we’ve been to for example). We also discussed who should propose who, he told me he really wanted to be the one doing it.

Yesterday, after I came back home from work exhausted, we cooked, watched tv and at some point I went to the hallway to hang a coat. He followed me and he proposed. Between the shoes on the floor, the kitchen and the restroom, he was kneeling.

I couldn’t believe it. It was such a disappointment knowing what we always talked about. I felt let down, had a lot of thoughts at once in my head.

Here is my probable asshole move: I was so hurt, I couldn’t say a word. Couldn’t even accept it. I looked at him, looked around me as I couldn’t believe where he proposed, felt the tears in my eyes. I nodded, and walked past him to lay on the bed and cry.

He took some time before following me and asking if anything was wrong. Told him I expected something different but would marry him regardless.

My friends are mixed about it, but a few of them did say I was being ungrateful and that it’s the thought that counts: he wants to marry me after all, and maybe this is the only thing that counts.

AITA?

**Update:** I would like to address a few recurring questions or remarks:

**‘’Maybe he was too excited to propose and couldn’t wait?’'** This is certainly possible, many of you commented that this is what happened to them. I am not aware if that’s the case yet, I will have to ask him tonight.

**‘’If you don’t like your proposal, why didn’t you propose instead?’'** I did offer to propose. I didn't care who proposed!It's not because he's the man that he had to propose, he wanted to do it.

**‘’Well, my partner proposed \[this way\] and I’m happy about it!’’** I’m happy that this worked for you. Not everyone share your view on engagement, what consists of a romantic gesture. And it’s okay! The important thing is that both parties are alright with it in the end. This didn’t work for me.

**‘’Why can’t you just be happy?’'** I am happy! I can be disappointed by the proposal and be happy and excited about being engaged. I believe both things aren’t mutually exclusive.

**‘’You sound like a controlling/abusive person/a bridezilla who will never be happy with what he does’'** Please realize that you make a ton of assumptions on myself and my relationship based on an anonymous post.

**‘’You are so entitled!’'** Some of you are acting as if what *we* wanted (reminder that we both brainstormed and wanted those things together, it wasn’t purely my idea) was a 5 stars hotel room, a fancy restaurant, a poney ride… while in reality, it was literally about a walk outside (living 20 minutes by foot near a forest we often go to)…

**‘’I thought it was a sweet proposal’'** Amongst other things we talked about, we talked about things we both liked, and disliked. One of the things I disliked was the idea of being proposed at home.

Thank you for everyone for commented, I read as many comments as I could, wether they were YTA, NTA, NAH, ESH. Different opinions helped me.

I decided to apologize for my behavior because I most probably hurt him. He’s my partner, I don’t want to hurt him, no matter what.

Considering the amount of things we talked about for a year or so, and how easy it was to make something we seemingly both wanted at some point, I now believe I have a right to being disappointed, while being happy because he proposed. This is absolutely not a deal breaker for me.

I will also have a conversation and understand why it happened this way, as there might be a reason and everything will be behind us.",2020-09-17 02:07:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/iua4dl/aita_for_leaving_the_room_without_a_word_after_my/,1912,7335,0.92,18
819,NAH,AITA for wanting my son to spend Christmas morning with me?,"A bit of background, me and my sons mother have split, and we alternate where our son (5M) spends Christmas Day. This year works out for him to spend it with his mother, which is absolutely fine by me. 

However, she is a care worker and is potentially scheduled to work 7:00-13:00. I discussed with her the idea that our son could stay the night on Christmas Eve at mine and wake up with me, open a few presents and I would have him back waiting outside for when she returned from work. That way, my son gets to wake up with one of his parents on Christmas morning, I get to see him on Christmas Day and his Mum doesn't miss out on any time.

His mother has outright said no, and if she does work our son would spend the morning with her partner she has only been with for the last few months, and he only moved in this week. Her reason is purely because it is her year to have him, despite her potentially not being there for half of the day. 

AITA here for suggesting this?",2020-11-24 19:11:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k0bj65/aita_for_wanting_my_son_to_spend_christmas/,141,179,0.93,0
820,NAH,AITA for playing along when my sister in law joked about us running away together?,"I am going to change names to protect our identities. My wife will be Rebecca and my sister in law will be Samantha. 

I have been married to Rebecca for six years, but in total we've been together for ten years. Rebecca and I met while we were both attending school out of state, so for the first six years we rarely saw her family. Then we moved back to our home state but to a part of it that's about two and a half hours from where Rebecca's family live. After living there for two years, we moved closer to her family and are now about 45 minutes away. As a result, I've spent  lot more time with her family, especially her immediate family (mom, dad, brother, and sister). 

I always gotten along with everyone, but being this close to them and spending this much time with them has led all of us to realize how much Samantha and I have in common. Just being honest, it's a lot, lot more than my wife and I have in common. This led to us becoming fast friends and developing a close relationship, but it is, and always has been, platonic and like brother-sister. 

Getting to the point of this post, at some point someone in Rebecca's family (I think it was her dad) joked that I had married the wrong sister, and Samantha seemed to find that hilarious and played along. From that point it became a running joke that I had made a mistake and when were Samantha and I going to run off together since we were star-crossed lovers meant to be together. 

At first it made me uncomfortable and I felt like it was disrespectful to Rebecca, but over time I got used to it since Rebecca's family teases each other this way and even Rebecca started joining in and saying that she was going to divorce me because she didn't want to stand in the way of a historic love. 

I started to play along with the joke, but I tried to keep it to basic stuff like where we'd live or what color curtains we'd have - stuff I felt was harmless and not romantic. I did ask Rebecca many times to confirm she still was comfortable with it and she always said it was fine because she never had any doubts about my love for her.  

What seems to have changed things was Rebecca's pregnancy. I didn't notice any difference until Samantha made a joke about how the baby was an extra complication and how I'd have to give it up but we could have our own someday. Rebecca didn't like this and said that the whole joke was, and always had been, disrespectful and we should all know better.

In hindsight, I think it was in really poor taste and I would not have laughed and played along, but  don't think it's fair to now say I am the asshole after she encouraged me to play along and reassured me that it was fine, and the rest of her family agrees. It feels like she has suddenly changed the rules and expected me to guess, but how was I supposed to know?

821,NAH,AITA for not buying milk for my son?,"My (34F) son is 8 years old. As far as my husband and I know, our son is a completely normal child for his age. Sometimes he can be a bit of a troublemaker, and other times he talks a little too much (usually about the gossip in his school), but he is overall a good child who likes riding his bike around the neighborhood with friends, playing Roblox, and painting fruit (yes, fruit. He likes painting watermelon, kiwis and avocados in particular, we have a collection.)

There's only one, tiny aspect of him that is... well, very, very peculiar. My son will pour himself a glass of milk, and then drain the rest of the milk jug down the sink. It's especially weird because he won't do this with any other drink, just milk, and he doesn't do this with food either.

When I first saw my son pouring the milk down in the sink, I was shocked and asked him why he did that. He said he just liked how it looked going down the drain. I told him he could do that with water, not milk. The second time, I got angry and told him not to. I explained to him that he's wasting money and food. But he just kept doing it. 

From there on out, this is what I tried: I reminded him that he's wasting money and food. I gave him time outs, I grounded him several times, I took away his electronics, etc. I told him he wasn't going to drink milk that day. I tried hiding it in a cooler in the garage, and I also tried putting a heavy magnet in the fridge. Then I bought those those pint sized cartons instead of jugs, but he would literally open every single unused carton and pour it down the sink. So I started to only buy milk every other week at the store. Then I started to buy milk only once a month. Then I stopped buying milk overall, because he would not learn.

Now I don't think it is a love/hate thing, because my son ironically really likes milk. He would drink 3 cups of it every single day by himself. When I stopped buying milk, he would just kind of mope around the house looking for something to drink. I told him to drink water. He says water doesn't quench his thirst like milk does. I said he could drink milk all he wants if he stopped pouring it down the drain. He said okay, but then poured it down the drain anyways later.

It's been about 3 months now with no milk. I do have a few cartons of those shelf stable milk cartons hidden away in the pantry just in case, but other than that, there is no milk in our house at all. My MIL recently came over to babysit for an evening and was very shocked to find out that we have no milk in our house. When my husband and I came home that evening, she yelled at us and called it child abuse that we would deprive our son of essential nutrients during a critical growing time. I told her that he keeps pouring the milk down in the drain but she would have none of it.

822,NAH,AITA for accidentally miss gendering my daughter?,"First time using Reddit.

Me (Male 32) and my adopted Daughter (Female 15) live alone in my house after my Ex decided to walk out of the picture right after adopting her.

And since quarantine started due to the virus I have started to notice small things that I usually wouldn't have noticed due to working almost all day, like her starting to act more feminine or secretly doing activities that are normally called ""girl only"" activities by society, and I started to think that she might be gay (I didn't know that Transgender was a thing until yesterday).

So I started to think in how to tell her that I supporter her when she eventually came out to me.

And she came out to me yesterday, she told me that she was Gay and Transgender, I didn't know what transgender was and told her ""Well, I don't exactly know what Transgender is but I'm always gonna consider you my son and I'm always gonna support you"", and yes I know I fucked up by saying that, she started to cry and run to her bedroom and locked herself inside, and now after searching what Transgender is I starter to feel like shit and I wanted to ask for the opinion of reddit.

AITA for doing an honest mistake and accidentally miss gendering my daughter?

UPDATE: After reading all the replies and getting some advice, I went to my daughter's room and apologized for miss gendering her and for now knowing what Transgender was, I also told her that what I really meant was that she will always be my child no matter gender or sexuality.

She cried happy tears this time knowing that she has someone that will support her uncondicionally.

After that we talked a little bit about how she feels and what I should do to help her during her transition.

Thanks Reddit, you all helped me a lot :)",2020-10-21 06:09:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jf7fxi/aita_for_accidentally_miss_gendering_my_daughter/,381,2459,0.93,13
823,NAH,AITA for wanting my husband to out me as trans for the sake of his nephew?,"I’ve (29nb) been with my husband (29m) “Harry” for 4 years. I’ve been honest with him from the start that I don’t see myself as a woman and that I might someday want to do something about the dysphoria. In February I decided to contact my country’s transgender health service (with Harry’s blessing) and I’ll be allowed to start T mid next year.

Harry’ straight so this has naturally caused some issues, but he’s adapting well to the potential changes and I’m hopeful.

As far as his family knows, I am and always have been a woman. I’ve been alright with this, they’re all very nice people and I know Harry doesn’t want to get into the complexities of his sexuality and where I fit into that. For my part, I’ve been as openly non-binary as a person can be without having the Gender 101 discussion with everyone and I’m not too fussed if people read me as a butch straight woman. 

Recently this out-but-not-quite thing has stopped working for me, because of Harry’s nephew “Aaron” (16m). Aaron came out as trans two years ago. He also struggles a lot with anxiety and depression. The whole family have been very supportive of him, but obviously being a dysphoric 16 year old with mental health problems is hell. I should know, I was one.

For a while now, I’ve been making the occasional suggestion that my husband at least tell his brother about my transness so Aaron would have the option of talking to someone who gets it. A few days ago Aaron had a bad downswing and was admitted to inpatient psych care, and I’ve become adamant that my transness be made known and my number offered to Aaron in case he wants to chat.

I’ve only met Aaron in person once, he lives on the other side of our country, so it would entirely be a case of “hey, chelaluna is trans and had a rough time as a teenager, they said you’re welcome to text them if you want to talk”. Honestly, from what I remember of being a teenager, just knowing that an adult like me existed and was happy and well would have made a world of difference.

Harry’s responses so far have been “remind me later” or “yeah, I could see how that would be helpful”. He changes the subject when I bring it up. He’s a generally conflict avoidant person and tends to do this with difficult conversations. Last night he got angry with me for “keep bringing it up” and “not letting him think it through” and he’s been distant today.

I am trying to be understanding of Harry’s issues here. This is a complex situation and he’s doing his best to deal with everything. Had Aaron not had this crisis I’d’ve been happy to let him work stuff out in his own time. I get that he’d basically be outing himself to his family and generating some awkward conversations.

But a) I’ll be starting T next year and it’ll start being obvious anyway and b) Aaron deserves to have this option.

So, AITA for trying to push my husband into outing us both sooner rather than later?

EDIT: we live in a country with a very low population and most of us live in small rural towns and villages. His town has about 800 people in it, mine has 850. Options like support groups etc don’t really exist outside of the capital city. Which is why I think Aaron would benefit from knowing someone like himself exists in his circle.

As for offering myself up as support, the ball would absolutely be in Aaron’s court. I just want him to know he has the option. As lovely as his parents are, he is going through stuff that’s very different to anything they dealt with at his age.",2020-11-22 14:09:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jyw7f8/aita_for_wanting_my_husband_to_out_me_as_trans/,128,289,0.83,1
824,NAH,AITA for burying my wife alive with pillows?,"So my wife bought these decorative pillows for our bed when we first got it. They do look great I have to admit, and we both love them during the day. But at night..... my gosh this woman slings them over to my side of the bed like a soldier chucking grenades from the trenches. She will literally throw all of them onto my side of the bed and go to sleep like nothing is wrong. She does this every night, which has caused us to be in a pillow war. Every night we find new and weird ways to piss each other off with how we can arrange the pillows only on the other persons side. Today I had the brilliant idea of letting her beat me to bed today so she stacks them all on my side. When she fell asleep, I built basically a pillow fort all around her with pillows from every room in our house. It was very unstable and fell as soon as she moved even an inch. Which was hilarious because she got hit with about 5 different pillows at once and she freaked out thinking someone was attacking her or something. Now she’s mad at me. AITA, or is all fair in love and pillow war?



TLDR: I built a pillow fort above my wife as she slept and it collapsed on her causing her to freak out.

EDIT: my gosh this blew up! First off, thank you all so much for the awards and love. To answer a few questions, we do not genuinely get upset at each other, it’s all out of love. We are newlyweds who have only been married for a few months. We only do this because we know it’s a competition to see who can have the best arrangement. To everyone telling us to just get a chair or a chest to put them in, we have the capability to put them somewhere else.

825,NAH,AITA for inviting my dad's girlfriend over my real mom to spend the day with me?,"My (17F) parents got divorced 6 years ago. My mom quickly remarried and my dad has been seeing his new girlfriend for nearly 2 years now. I now live at mom's house for two weeks, then switch over to dad's house for the next two weeks.

My relationship with my mom has always been difficult. I always felt like my mom wished for a more 'girly' daughter, so we could do classical mother-daughter activities together but I'm simply not that person my mom wants me to be. I've always been more 'tomboyish' and been into sports, especially tennis since was a little girl, something my mom never truly understood or made an effort to be interested in. As a result my mom and I never had the close mother-daughter relationship I feel like my mom wished for us to have.

Now my relationship with my dad has been the polar opposite. My dad and I always got along great and I have always been a 'daddy's girl'. But when my dad introduced me to his new girlfriend Julia, I instantly disliked her. My younger me thought she was stealing my dad from me. Her being relatively young (27 when they began dating), and a - how I unfairly stereotyped her at first - 'vapid pretty girl' certainly didn't make me like her either. But my younger me misjudged her, and she's honestly pretty great. She always supported me, showed in interest in my passions, showed up to my tennis matches - something my mom didn't bother to do - and has been a great person all around. I'm now ashamed to admit this but I didn't recognize this until \~3 months ago and have been acting pretty horrible towards her before that.

The problem: Second last weekend I had a tennis tournament where I got second place. For the second place, I won a spa day for me and a guest. I decided to invite Julia (my dad's gf) to thank her for supporting me and for dealing with my horrible behavior. You don't believe how happy she was when I invited her. But when I returned to my mom's place on Sunday evening my mom kind of assumed I would invite her as my guest for the spa day. She seemed to really look forward to it. When I awkwardly told her that I already invited Julia she was disappointed and sad. Since then, she has acted downcast and moody, and we haven't really talked. I tried to explain the situation to her, but she won't listen.

Now I feel horrible. I feel like really hurt my mom and I feel like I chose Julia over her.

826,NAH,AITA for going to college and asking for the money from a trust fund after my dad spent it because I previously said I wasn't interested in college?,"When my grandmother passed away, she left behind a trust that was only designated as for my dad's kids education costs. 50 thousand was earmarked for me and my younger half sister each. And we had until we were 30 years old to use it before the money went to my dad to use as he wished.

When I graduated high school, I got an interesting job and decided against college.

My dad asked me if I was very sure when I was 20 that I'm not going down the college path, and I said no.

My younger half sister ended up going to a private college. She's two years younger than me.

I'm now 26. My job has a program where they pay 25% of a 4 year college program for qualified employees.

I got accepted to an awesome school and with a scholarship, my company's contributions and the 50 thousand from the trust, I would graduate with zero debt.

So I told my dad about my plan and he immediately panicked. Apparently he gave all the money to my sister because I had said I wasn't going to college. She graduated with zero debt.

I was pissed off that he had done this without at least giving me a heads up. I then reminded him that the money was legally mine and that I expected to receive it.

In the end, my dad had to take out a loan to give me the money. His wife is furious about the situation and my dad is upset with me.

I'm really enjoying college at least, even if it is online.

827,NAH,Aita for 'calling my sister ugly'?," 

I (24F) have been modeling since I was 18, I love my work and I think it’s fun but it’s definitely not for everyone. For one, you have to have very thick skin because people are super honest and will just outright tell you what they don’t like about you. Like I’ve been told that I’m ugly and “maybe I’d be pretty one day if I got like a nose job or something” Your whole career is based around how you look so I can definitely be stressful sometimes. 

My sister just turned 18 and she wants to get into modeling as well. My sister is gorgeous and I would definitely be able to help her get into the industry I just think it’s a bad idea. I love my sister to death but she is definitely insecure about how she looks and she can be sensitive. My sister is at a normal healthy weight for her height and age but would definitely be told to lose weight and I feel like that would really hurt her self confidence and self worth.

I told my sister that maybe modeling isn’t for her and she took at as me calling her ugly. My sister is very very pretty and would be a good model but shes just so sensitive. A girl at school once said she didn’t like her make up and she cried for a week about it.

828,NAH,AITA for begging my sister to let me live in her guest house.,"My family and I are currently homeless (me, my wife, and our 2 kids). We were evicted because our landlord sold the apartment. It was a good friend that had been renting to us and well below market rate. Basically they were breaking even. We have not been able to find anything within our budget (been searching for about 6 months). We've applied to a few one bedrooms but I feel they discriminate against families. They almost always say the place is too small. It's bigger than a fucking a tent, I'll tell you that.

My kids have been going between a few friends houses while my wife and I sleep in parks (shelters are closed because of the pandemic). we visit the kids on weekends (no way to travel to them during the week). We had to sell our vehicle and now sleep walking distance to our jobs. Kids are a few towns over where its cheaper and where we were living (no work besides minimum wage).

My sister lives bussing distance to our works, near some good schools and I've repeatedly begged her if we could stay with her until we've got things figured out. It's killing my wife and I being away from our kids. Things are just genuinely horrible all around and my wife's mental state is going down hill fast. All she does is cry.

We don't use drugs. We don't drink. We work. We are TRYING but my sister refuses to help. She very much lives a kid free lifestyle and is definitely the sort that think people who don't have much money are just lazy. She continuously calls me lazy and stupid for my current situation.

It came to a head last night when my wife was talking about how she's extraordinarily depressed and does much have the will to go on much longer. She's never talked like that before and it scared me so I contacted my sister again and really begged to allow us to stay or at the very least just my wife for awhile.

Her husband ended up taking the phone and telling me I'm an asshole for keeping asking when they've said no repeatedly. I said I'm desperate and I'd do literally anything to stay.

829,NAH,AITA for telling my landlady it’s not really any of her business what I do in her house?,"My bf and I, both in our 20s are renting a house from a woman, she’s about 35 and lives about 20 mins away. 

We pay an outrageous amount of money in rent, the deposit was like 3 times the rent. The only rules she had and the only rules on the lease are no smoking indoors, no major modifications to the interior and any damage not covered by the deposit would come out of our pocket. Very standard and straight forward. 

I wouldn’t say my relationship with her is bad or good, we’ve been here 2 years and I’ve seen her a grand total of 4 times. I always pay her on time and she repairs things quickly enough so all good there. We are good tenants and we can’t complain about her.

Occasionally she will come pick up her mail as some of it still gets sent here. I invite her in for some coffee when that’s the case as I have nothing to hide. Well she saw the ashtray on the porch and the bong in the living room. It wasn’t out in the open but on a shelf. She instantly freaked out saying it made her extremely uncomfortable that we were doing illegal things in her house. 

I told her that we never ever smoke inside, we always take it outside, the house doesn’t smell at all and it was all purchased legally. She went off on a tangent and started getting an attitude and asked me to not do that anymore. I told her as nicely as possible that as long as I’m not breaking any of her rules, and I’m not damaging anything in the house (which I’m not) that it’s not really any of her business what I do here. 

I asked her if she noticed a smell in the house but she just huffed at me, told me she’d be back in a few months for her mail and she left. I sent her the rent money and she said thank you as usual but my mom says I was TA for saying that 

AITA?

EDIT: I live in California and I’m over 21, it’s completely legal for recreational use. If it wasn’t legal here I would agree with her not wanting it in her house. But as far as the law is concerned there’s nothing wrong with it

EDIT 2: some of you are concerned she may find a way to kick me out once the lease is up, that’s ok because we plan on moving when that time comes anyway:)",2020-11-16 19:31:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jvdaur/aita_for_telling_my_landlady_its_not_really_any/,74,1007,0.96,0
830,NAH,AITA for eating take-out while my step Dad had a heart attack?,"**EDIT -** So I don't have to keep making the same point - I waited outside with her 30 minutes. Food arrived. I took it inside and immediately went back outside. The adrenaline had worn off by then and I noticed it was cold so I asked if she wanted to go inside after 5 minutes. She said no. I then went inside after waiting with her 35 minutes total - there was nothing we could do but wait and she had been standing away from me when we were waiting. I asked her a few times if she was ok or needed anything. She said no.

She usually deals with stress by being alone and usually asks for some space - she is not upset I didn't continue to wait with her and that is not what I'm asking about. She is upset that I was able to eat food whilst this was all going on. I know her and the hints I was getting from her body language was that I wasn't helping by hovering around her anyway.

Whilst I'm happy my step Dad is alive and have no harsh feelings to him, I don't know him that well. I was concerned for him but I don't know him well enough to truly panic. I saw him every other year for a few weeks of my life and I've known him this time for a few months. Nice guy, glad he's ok, but I can't force myself to love him like family. When I went inside I was cold, tired from a 12 hour shift and performing CPR, and I hadn't eaten in a few hours. I was on autopilot as the adrenaline had worn off. Perhaps it was insensitive of me but I thought I had done all I could at that point.

Again, my Mum is not upset I went inside. She's upset I ate as she thinks I don't care about my step Dad. I do care but not to the extent she'd like. That is the issue - not whether I left her outside.

I also did all I could in terms of CPR, talking to paramedics, and offering her my support verbally. Someone suggested I should have driven her to hospital - we were waiting outside the ambulance and I don't drive. I'm also 18 and here on an apprenticeship program so there are limits to what I can offer to do for her practically. My apprenticeship involves manual work which is doubly exhausting. Right now we're on lockdown so I'm the only one working in our household and I think she forgets how tiring shift work is as she hasn't done it for months. We're also in the UK and I think Americans have some strange ideas about what you do in a crisis - she would have killed me if I'd started calling all her friends to come over mid heart attack. We also deal with things in a bit more of a repressed way so we don't do the whole sobbing and hugging thing Americans seem to think should be going on. 

\-----

Last night I got off work late so I ordered food. I'm staying with my Mum and step Dad for a few months. I never knew him that well as I grew up with my bio Dad from age 6 when my parents split. I visited my Mum every other summer and we've always been on friendly terms but never super close until I moved to their city for work. I'm staying until I can find a place to rent myself.

Shortly before my take-out arrived my step Dad collapsed. My Mum called me for help and of course I helped. We called an ambulance and gave him first aid together until the paramedics took over. They got a pulse and transferred him to the ambulance. They lost the pulse in the ambulance and couldn't take him to hospital until they got it back - the woman explained this to us before shutting the doors.

Around this point my take-out arrived. I paid and explained what was happening as the delivery guy was obviously kind of freaked out by the ambulance outside where he was dropping off food. I took the food inside and came back out to check on my Mum. She was waiting outside the ambulance and wasn't allowed in while they were working on my step Dad. I stayed with her for about 5 minutes and then suggested we go wait inside as it was cold. She said no she'd wait outside.

I said to call me if she needed me and went inside. I had already ordered the food, it was there and going cold, I hadn't eaten in hours so I just decided to eat while I waited. Mum came inside and found me eating and told me it was selfish of me to be eating when a family member was dying. I stopped eating as it was clearly upsetting her.

Step Dad is alive today. He had a heart attack but his chances look good. I'm genuinely glad he's ok. This morning Mum told me she can't believe how cold and callous I am and she thinks I hate her and my step Dad and blame them for my parents divorce. I don't hate either - I didn't think me eating take out while we waited was a cold thing but it seems to have really upset her. I don't care about the divorce anymore either.

For context the whole incident from calling the ambulance to the ambulance leaving took an hour and 15 minutes. Food arrived halfway through all of this and there was nothing I could have done to help.",2020-11-09 18:27:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jr355h/aita_for_eating_takeout_while_my_step_dad_had_a/,186,471,0.97,0

Both were confused as to why I told them and why I was scared to, as if I was going to be rejected, they asked if I took them for hypocrites, and if I had learned anything from the tales of rejection that they had told me, and that they would never treat me differently.

I feel odd about the whole thing and my little brother (technically, we are only 2 months apart) said I was a jerk for making it such a big deal because he heard my parents and they were worried I was going to tell them I was on drugs.

Edit:

Wife has finished work and we've had a talk about it.

It seems wife doesnt trust SIL with the kids as there are some incidents in the past that I was not fully aware of (nothing abusive, just unsafe - falling asleep when watching children etc). Wife doesn't want SIL dealing with the kids alone for this reason.

I have also mentioned potential thyroid issues as there are more than a few symptoms that line up.

Thank you all for your help and advice

It does make it trickier to get time alone, but we can work around it.

We've essentially kissed and made up.

Thank you all again



Some backstory:

My wife seems to be tired all the time, she has suffered depression in the past which often manifested as fatigue. I let her sleep whenever I can

I work permanent nights so I can be home with my son and daughter whilst my wife is at work. I have worked nights for 5 years so far.

Currently, my sister-in-law (SIL) is staying with us due to an unrelated situation at her home

Onto the current situation:

I was at work last night, as usual, when I recieved a message from SIL saying that my daughter (aged 4) had woken up and she didn't know what to do. My wife was still asleep.

I told SIL to give Daughter a small drink, then tuck her back up into bed, explaining to her that it is night time so she needs to sleep because night time is for sleeping

SIL handled the situation, daughter went back to sleep, all sorted.

This morning I got home, made my wife a coffee and woke her up for work, and mentioned that Daughter had woken in the night. Wife responded by saying ""someone should have woken me up""

""Why? The situation was handled, there was no need for you to miss out on sleep""

""I could have bought her into bed with me and she would have slept""

""She can't keep coming into our bed in the night when she wakes up, she needs to sleep in her own bed""

""Well at least then I wouldn't have had to be in bed alone!""

""That's unfair. You know I would rather be in bed with you but one of us has to work nights so someone can be here for the kids. There's no way I can win here""

""You already have.""

Then she stormed off to the bathroom and slammed the door.

Now she's pissed off with me for not waking her up, even though she is tired all the time, I was trying to let her get some sleep and I didn't see any reason why she would need to wake up if the situation was handled.

I tried to speak with her in the kitchen by saying ""would you rather I wake you up or let you get sleep? You're tired all the time I was just trying to let you rest""

""I AM tired all the time. I can cope with being tired. You should have woken me up""

""Ok, I'll know that for the future""

Then she stormed past me again saying ""I need to get ready for work""

I'm honestly baffled at what I've done wrong here",2020-11-11 07:24:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/js3qev/aita_for_not_waking_up_my_wife_when_my_daughter/,106,835,0.96,0
834,NAH,AITA For getting mad that a cashier thinks my military ID is fake and would call the manager?,"So little backstory.

I have been stationed overseas until January of 2020. I would come back to the states for the holidays. Due to the length of stay overseas, my state ID expired, so my only forms of ID were my military ID and passport.

FYI california passed a law in 2016 that sets the legal age to buy tobacco & related products to 21. Military are exempt from this age restrictions, but I was 27-28 at the time (birthday happened during the time). And I am a cigar smoker.

Onto the story.

In December 2017-January 2018 I was in california visiting family for the holidays. One day the eldest of my younger sisters decided to go for a walk. I tagged along because well, I haven't seen her for a few years and wanted to catch up.

We walked around for an hour or so and ended up at a park. I had felt the usual addict urge at this point and ask to go to a more secluded area. I am very concerned about second hand and impressions on young children. We did, pull out my zippo and... nothing. It's gone dry. Que immediate cursing like the sailor I am.

We had passed a 7/11 when we entered into the park, so I told her I was going to buy a lighter there. I had left my passport at family member I was stay with. So I figures there wouldn't be any problems or anything, quick in and out and I'd get my fix.

I get in the store, grab a lighter and headed to the cashier. Before the cashier asked for my ID I showed my military ID. The cashier asked to look it over, so I handed it to them. Now I have dealt with bars not knowing where the date of birth is on a military ID so I informed the cashier where it was.

The cashier handed my ID back and said its fake. I asked them why they thought it was fake. ""Its fake because I've never seen an ID like that before."" Okay, I doubt many people that aren't anywhere near a military base would have ever seen one. I told the cashier that it's a military ID.

Now remember, military is exempt from the 21 age law, and the ID shows that I am an Active Duty Service Member. They still claim it to be fake, so I pulled up the cac.mil website and showed them the sample ID. (The website is an official Department of Defense website. Literally a government website) They still believe it to be fake, so I asked for a manager. ""My manager will say it is fake also. And they are not here currently. It is only me.""

Can you call for your manager? ""No.""

At this point, I am getting agitated, I grilled them about the law, their and the manager's name and number. I asked a lot more questions but I don't remember them off the top.of my head.

At this point the cashier looks scared. I should note, that he was taller and definitely had more muscle than me. The cashier just said fine and let me purchase the lighter.

Now I admit, I myself think I was the asshole, but also the cashier for refusing to contact the manager. Thoughts?

TL:DR. Cashier thought my military ID was fake, refused to call manager. I grilled the cashier, cashier gave in.",2020-11-25 16:11:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k0uyv2/aita_for_getting_mad_that_a_cashier_thinks_my/,84,130,0.92,0

836,NAH,AITA for not listening to my husband’s delusions anymore?,"Throw away account because I don’t know if my husband uses Reddit. 

My husband (30M) and I (27F) have been together for 5 years, married for 3. Our relationship and marriage has been nothing short of amazing the whole time we’ve been together, but lately he’s been having some weird issues. To name a few, he has started talking to me in code that he swears I understand. It’s English, but the words are jumbled, they make no sense whatsoever, and when I don’t understand what he is saying he will either laugh and say I don’t remember our “inside joke” or get really upset. He says this has always been our language and this is how we express our love to each other. That’s probably the weirdest thing. 

Another example is he has started claiming that my own father hates him. This isn’t true. My father loves my husband. He always has. He is extremely paranoid that my father shows up at our house at night. He gets up at least once or twice a night to check the doors and windows, sometimes walks outside with a flashlight looking around for him. He simply thinks my father is out to get him. Every time I try to talk to him about this he tells me I don’t understand but “I will soon.” I’ve also noticed he has started to put things in the wrong places. For example, he put chips in the refrigerator, his wallet in the cupboard, peanut butter in the freezer, toilet paper in the pantry (it goes in the bathroom) and has even put our remote inside the shams of our pillows. 

He also spends almost all of his time on his laptop and won’t tell me what he’s doing. Every time I come near him he slams his laptop closed. I finally broke and told him I’m sick of his fucking delusions and that I can’t be in a marriage with someone I can no longer understand or communicate with. I called him a shell of the man he used to be and that I regret marrying him. I know I shouldn’t have said these things but I’m so exhausted, I’m so confused, I’ve tried to get him help and he refuses. He hasn’t spoken to or looked at me since this incident. 


AITA for blowing up on him when he could be suffering from something serious and not wanting to listen to his delusions/deal with his weird behavior anymore?

837,NAH,AITA for giving my wife a placebo,"This happened last night and I’m struggling with what to do now. 

My wife (38F) and I (42M) have a relationship built on complete honesty and it’s something I value highly. This is why I think I might be TA

Yesterday my wife had a really rough day at work and was feeling very anxious in bed last night. She said that there’s so much going through her head and she won’t be able to sleep at all, but really needed to because she had such a big day at work the next day. 

We usually have sleeping pills that we take only in these extreme situations where we need a really good sleep. Maybe only a couple of times a year. 

She asked for a sleeping pill last night, as I keep them next to my bed. I looked over and realised we were out and told her. She was very upset and said ‘great now I’m not going to be able to sleep and it’s going to ruin my day’. 

I looked down and saw that we had some over the counter antihistamines (think claritin, non-drowsy) and they have a very similar shape and size to the sleeping pills we normally have. 

A split second thought occurred to me and I grabbed one, and told her that I found one last one in the bottom of the drawer, and handed it to her. 

She was very thankful, took the pill, and settled in to go to sleep. In 15 minutes she was out like a light. 

This morning I asked how she slept, and she said she had a great nights sleep and thanked me again. 

I know it only worked because of the placebo effect, which only worked because I was dishonest with her. She has taken these antihistamines before so I wasn’t worried about any unknown effects. 

Did I do bad? AITA? I’m also torn as to whether to come clean this morning.

Update: I told her. She was very surprised how well it worked and said that the antihistamine never made her sleepy before. Then jokingly was upset with me for telling her because now that she knows, the placebo effect won’t work again. There you go. 

Thanks all for the advice. Quite a divided response. Bless this sub.",2020-10-26 22:35:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jip0ed/aita_for_giving_my_wife_a_placebo/,192,2172,0.98,0
838,NAH,AITA for telling my dads new wife she can’t come to my college graduation?,"My mom died in 2012. Two years later my dad met a new woman and then married her in 2016. He didn’t tell my siblings and I he was getting married until 2 days before the wedding.

I also started college in 2016, so I’ve only been around his new wife when I was home on break or holiday. She is nice enough, but we don’t have a deep relationship whatsoever. She also pretends to be my mom and tells people I’m her child which I despise- I met her when I was 17 years old. 

Now I’m about to graduate college and I really want my dad, sister, and brother to come. This is a big accomplishment for me and I want to celebrate as a family. I told my dad I’d love for him to come but I don’t want his new wife to attend. We aren’t that close and it would just remind me my own mom can’t be there, which kills me. 

My dad refused to come unless his wife comes. He would also pay for my siblings tickets (since they’re younger) and so they wouldn’t be able to come either. This means I won’t have any family at graduation. 

I feel hurt my dad is doing this. However, he believes I’m in the wrong and says it’s so unfair that I’m putting him in this position. I feel like it’s my day and I should be able to say who can come.

839,NAH,"AITA for telling my gf that it's ""my house"" that I'm building and not hers.","I am building my very first home. Living in an area where 3 bedroom houses are extremely affordable including land ($300K-400K AUD) it is a perfect investment opportunity. My parents have offered some support to help fund my deposit where as my new full time job has allowed me to secure a loan from the bank. Very excited to begin the next stage of adulthood.

During the initial planning process, my gf has offered suggestions here and there to improve the house flow which I have happily thought about and even included in the designs. But today she mentioned that she said to her work collegues that ""we were building a house"" and the other night she said ""I don't like that design choice, I want you to change it because I hate it. It looks like a prison"" (Just some window's that look like jail bars even though I really don't see it that way). But the way she said it felt very demanding. I could of been reading it wrong but the way I felt afterwards just didn't sit right with me.

I asked her that it is my first house that I want to build and have it constructed my way. I'm putting the deposit in, my parents have helped me as well and have a small stake in it too. They even have gone as far as writing up a contract to say the deposited money belongs to them (because it's their investment). This money I will pay back to them when my inheritence comes through. Because I've been in this relationship for 4 years (lived together for 9 months), defacto laws will almost basically apply and she can technically have a right to some ownings and assets like the house and deposit from my parents (But they want a contract signed to prevent that), if we ever decided to break up.

I do not believe she has ever had any intent to ever do such a thing and I trust her fully, I want this to become a home we can share together and potentially build a life in. I know later in life if we get married things will become ""ours"" and not ""his"" and ""hers"", but at this current stage in a our relationship I feel like some things are still our own. This is my first house I'm building, I want it built the way I want it, because I'm making the hefty deposit along with my parents to get it built and she hasn't put any stake into it (Not that I'm wanting her to at this time, just typical portion of rent for the mortgage payments like any landlord would). I am happy to take on board suggestions, but I just wonder if she has gotten carried away with this as something she can have change because she thinks it's ""her house"" too. Even though once it's built I'm happy to work together to make it ""our home"" we live in like any rental place we would do in the past.

So am I the asshole for telling her that it's my house and not hers at this time?

Edit: I think one important aspect I have missed is. **This house really is a stepping stone, it's an investment opportunity for me at this current time frame, thanks to grants from the government in Australia.** Later we can put our earnings together and go for a better dream home, one that we could prepare for as a family. I'm only 25 and we have agreed to aim to have kids after the age of 30 (that is my limit where I feel comfortable doing so). We can use the house as leverage and apply our incomes together to get an even bigger loan to build a potential dream family home later in a few years that we both compromise and love the look of.

At this moment, it's a house that I want built the way that I want right now. But together I'm happy to build a home within that we can come back to after work and feel happy and comfortable in.

Edit 2: I will bring up a point in terms of this being reversed. If she was doing the same thing as me and building a house by herself with her own money as the deposit, I would 100% support her decision and never try to claim it as our house. Happy to offer suggestions in stuff that may work but ultimately let her make the final call. It's her effort and her work putting towards it and I would support her for that, I would never try to stoke a claim as it being ""mine"" at this time because I never put a large down payment towards it.

Edit 3: Maybe another tad bit of information for her side. **In regards to wanting to put something in with the deposit for the house, she refused and didn't want too go joint with it.** Because her brother did a joint deposit with his gf and they broke up a year later. And the fallout with the spliting of assets/deposits has been a nightmare and she doesn't want to deal with that anxiety.",2020-10-11 12:34:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/j94mrx/aita_for_telling_my_gf_that_its_my_house_that_im/,484,1465,0.94,1

The issue started when I wanted to get a priest to bless the apartment and I wanted to put a small figure of the Virgin Mary with a tea candle on the nightstand next to my side of the bed (he has his own nightstand as well on his side). He wasn’t raised religious and has no ties or resent towards the church, which means that he accepts that I am religious and doesn’t care, but doesn’t join. I am completely okay with that, but when I tried to get the apartment blessed and put up the figure, which are very commonly done in my culture and are parts of my religious expression, he got angry and said that he doesn’t feel comfortable with me doing this in an apartment that was as much his as mine. I never said he had to believe in it and thought that since he doesn’t really care about religion he’d be indifferent to it like he is indifferent to me attending Mass and doing things like praying the rosary with my family when they come visit. He just never joins in and we all respect that. He claims that he feels that I am trying to force my views on him with this and that he doesn’t want religion in his home, but I’m really just trying to follow my beliefs. It’s not like I’m covering the place with crosses and hosting religious ceremonies for goodness sakes!

843,NAH,AITA about my son's name change?,"My 20yo son is changing his name. Primarily, he wants to change his last name because his biological father is an abusive addict who is out of his life. But while he's doing it he decided to change his first name as well, because his first name is extremely common, as in 4 kids in his 2nd grade class with the same name. 

The thing is, the new first name he has chosen is my late stepfather's name. It's a very unusual ethnic name. My stepdad was the only person I've ever met with this name. Obviously my stepdad was a wonderful parent/grandparent to me and my son. I just can't imagine calling anyone else by this name. 

I don't object to my son changing his name to that, and I don't have any real attachment to my son's current name. It was just a name I liked at the time. 

My son says he doesn't mind if I still call him by his birth name, but certain friends and family (most of whom did not know my stepdad) seem to think I'm an awful person if I don't call my son by his chosen name.

844,NAH,AITA for making my husband change ALL the dirty nappies (diapers)?,"My husband and I had a baby 10 days ago. I was discharged 5 days ago. Giving birth to my son was highly traumatic to my body and I'm in pain I never thought was possible to be in. 

We're both on parental leave. I mainly lie in bed trying to heal. Getting up is extremely painful so I told my husband that he would have to change all nappies and when the baby cries at night he has to get up and hand him to me so I can feed him. At first this was ok but today he told me he's tired of doing all the work and I should change at least some nappies and take him a few times by myself at night. We got into an argument about it. I'm just so angry. I'm in so much pain, literally just pushed out a huge baby and my body is fucked. I haven't slept properly in 4 months and I just want to heal. The pregnancy and birth were so traumatic that I honestly don't understand how anyone can have more than one child. Like I love my son but I'm fucked just completely knackered.

My husband says he's tired too and we both wanted to be parents so we should both actually BE parents.

Edit: typo

Small update: I showed my husband this post and he was really embarrassed. He apologized and said he's just overwhelmed mainly because he nearly lost me and he's scared to make a mistake with the baby.

845,NAH,AITA for telling my 3 y.o that my MIL can't put her to bed bc she didn't behave?,"My daughter, E (nearly 3) has always been pretty mischievous. E likes to push buttons and it's gotten a lot worse since her sibling was born. 

When E behaves or listens well, I make a point to thank her and to tell her that she's doing a great job/listening really well, etc. I've done sticker charts and all that for cleaning, bedtime and the potty which all have seemed to work well. She just really has a hard time listening.

MIL was over and E told me that she wanted MIL to put her to bed. MIL has put E to bed before and likes doing it. I was giving the kids a bath and E took one of her toys full of water and dumped it on the floor. I told E to please keep water in the tub. E moved on to splashing water on the baby. I don't mind if E pours water on the baby's belly, but she kept holding the toy up high and water was splashing the baby's face. I asked E to stop and she didn't, so I took the toy away. Then E kept taking a wet wash rag and holding it over the edge of the tub. I told E to stop getting water on the floor again. She didn't listen. So I told her that if she doesn't listen, I won't let MIL put her to bed. She kept doing it and I started counting. I reminded her calmly what the consequence was if she didn't stop. I got to 3 and told her MIL can't put her to bed. E lost her shit thrashing around in the tub. I pulled her out and told her that was enough and she starts hitting and kicking. I called my husband to watch the baby and took E to her room. E was crying/screaming. I got her ready for bed and told her that I needed her to calm down a bit so we could talk and hugged her. We went over what happened and why. How she needs to be careful with the baby b/c she could hurt them and how she needs to try her best to listen better so things go better for us both.

I went out and told my MIL that I was going to put her to bed and my MIL got upset and was crying and said that she would appreciate it if I didn't ""use her"" that way and she felt like she needed to say something about it. I told her that I made sure to tell E that it wasn't because MIL didn't want to. E came out to say goodnight and they were both crying. I went back into E's room and talked to her again. I made sure she understood that MIL was not putting her to bed only because that was something I decided; not because she didn't want to - and that we both love her very much.

AITA? I can see where MIL's coming from and I'm going to avoid that from now on, but I think that crying about it infront of E like that was inappropriate. I'm not a perfect mom, but she just really made me feel like I was wrong. It's hard to know what the right thing to do is all the time as a parent and it just made me feel like shit. I don't enjoy seeing E crying/upset as it is, so the way things went with my MIL really just made me upset. Honestly I've cried the entire time I typed this.",2020-11-23 03:01:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jz9ipe/aita_for_telling_my_3_yo_that_my_mil_cant_put_her/,69,151,0.95,0
846,NAH,AITA for wanting my own test results,"My mom is hiding information to me that I feel is crucial to my health.

I have always struggled a lot in school and my mom had always said my brother has adhd and I don’t.I’ve always been really responsible and wanted to do well in school but have slipped up a ton in grades over  the years.

I was recently diagnosed with adhd and show all symptoms of it. I also take the medication and feel absolutely nothing no matter how much I take so I’m almost positive I do have adhd.

But my mom has always said she took my brother to a 6000$ brain test when we were kids. She said it said that I didn’t have adhd. I remember she took us to a far away hospital for a three day test that apparently tested for a bunch of brain stuff. I’m assuming it could show things such as autism, adhd, bipolar, depression idk. I guess I could be autistic and maybe she didn’t want me to know but I don’t relate to autism in a my way and score really low on online tests. She will not give me the results and seems panicked and really cruel and defensive when I ask. She won’t tell me the hospital name and says she forgot but it was the only hospital that offered this test.

I’m so annoyed because if I am taking adhd medication Bc I was diagnosed w/ adhd last year. and she says that this test I took when I was an 8 year old says I don’t have adhd. I don’t want to take the meds if I don’t have adhd and want to fix the real issue. I also would like to prepare or see if I’m at risk for other things. She responded really strange like she was hiding something when I asked to see results. She changes her answers each time- she said the test said my brother has adhd than she said the test said he might have adhd— it’s a 6k$ test and I don’t believe it’s just saying possibilities. I don’t even know what it tested for

My mom says I just want an excuse for grades and is making rude comments. I’m 20 and feel it’s only fair that I get to see the results or know what I was tested for- she like stumbles over her words when I ask abt it. She mentioned how they tested for cognitive speed and following directions when they made it seem like know one was watching us. apparently I followed directions and my brother just played w toys",2020-11-06 01:18:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jovhds/aita_for_wanting_my_own_test_results/,159,332,0.95,0
847,NAH,WIBTA if I insist my girlfriend do the majority of the dishes if she insists on living in a place without a dishwasher?,"Girlfriend and I are moving in together, and looking for an apartment. In addition to shared requirements (can’t be too noisy or too small, has to be in a nice building, etc.), we each have our personal requirements which we’ve agreed to compromise on. For example, she needs to be near a certain subway line. I need the apartment to have a dishwasher.

One apartment we’re looking at is perfect, except for the fact that it doesn’t have a dishwasher. My girlfriend absolutely loves the place and is very insistent we try and move in. I told her that as we agreed beforehand, the lack of a dishwasher is a dealbreaker. I’ve lived with and without dishwashers and will never go back to not having one. She’s only ever lived in places with dishwashers and does not understand how much more work hand washing everything is. She insists that it’s not much extra work, and that I’m being lazy. Important to note that we both love to cook a lot and therefore always have a lot of dishes to clean up.

WIBTA if I told her that if we move here, it’s only fair that she do the majority of the dishes? From my experience, having a dishwasher cuts washing time at least in half, so I think it would be fair for her to do twice as many dishes as I would.

*****

EDIT: Thanks everyone for suggesting a portable dishwasher! I honestly had no idea these existed. I brought this up with my girlfriend and she is 100% willing to split whatever the cost of one is, so we're gonna get something fancy. Now just fingers crossed that the apartment in question is still available!

I agree that I would have been the AH if I insisted on unevenly splitting dishes. When I wrote this post, I was irrationally annoyed at my girlfriend's dismissal of how long it takes to do dishes without a dishwasher, and in retrospect my ask would have done nothing but create resentment on both sides.",2020-10-15 14:39:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jborpl/wibta_if_i_insist_my_girlfriend_do_the_majority/,380,947,0.96,1
848,NAH,AITA for refusing family therapy?,"I'm (19M) in a bind, kinda, and I could use some guidance.

My mom died when I was 8 and my dad remarried when I was 10. My little sisters were 7 and 6 at the time of our dad getting remarried. I admit I wasn't exactly happy that our dad remarried. I felt it was unfair to push it on us so fast. He said he deserved to be happy and we needed a mother. I told him nobody else could be our mother. He told me I couldn't speak for my sisters. Then I corrected that I could speak for me and I wasn't going to ever have a mom again.

His wife for the most part did seem to genuinely try but she pissed me off on some things. Mainly she didn't like me calling her by her first name and wanted a mom nickname (she suggested mum, ma, momma) and I didn't like the idea of giving her a mom centric name and refused. She didn't like my refusal. She also didn't like that I refused to celebrate her on Mother's Day. I told them to pick another day if she wanted to feel special but Mother's Day was a day for me was a day for my mom and my grandmothers, not anybody else. Then the next offense came when I said I did not want to be there when she gave birth (she and my dad have two kids together). She tried to make my sisters be there too and they were uncomfortable so I stood up for them. She thought I was influencing them too much. Our dad always sided with her so my issues with her are also issues with him but I also have outside issues with him. The final one came when I was graduating and the tickets were being sent directly to our houses. We were asked whether it should be addressed to ""The Parent of"" or ""The Parents of"" and I chose Parent over Parents. She said she deserved recognition in having the tickets addressed to Parents.

I moved out pretty soon after my 18th birthday and have not really returned since... which has upset them. I live with my boyfriend and stay in touch with my sisters but honestly I don't have a relationship with my dad that means much to me anymore so I am not really in touch with anyone else.

They asked me to go to family therapy with them and my sisters so we can work out everything and become closer. I said no. They think I'm an ass for not wanting to give it a shot. But I know we won't agree on this and I know I will never accept her as my mother or believe he did enough for me after I lost my mom so I'm not seeing a point when the first one is THE issue that has come up all the time since they got married and the latter is something my dad doesn't want to hear. But I'm wondering if I should go for my sisters. IDK.

Ever since we had Evelyn, me and Amy have always made it a priority to have date nights every Friday night. No exceptions. Sick kid? We live near plenty of family who can take care of them.

If we go out, we usually get a family member or sitter to watch them. Other times, if we stay home, we have the girls go to their rooms for about an hour. During the pandemic we usually have date nights at home or go to a park or hit a drive-thru.

This particular Friday, we stayed home and had dinner, talked about stuff, and there was some making out. We sent both girls to their rooms for an hour and they both had homework. Claudia was having trouble with a math question beforehand and I promised to help her when me and her mom were over with our date.

850,NAH,"AITA for keeping my boyfriends dogs out of the ""most comfortable"" dog bed in the house?","My dog is a large lanky dog and he has a pretty kickass bed that is a memory foam insert on a raised platform. I got him this specifically becuase he has issues with his back legs and he struggles to get up off the ground. Ultimately he does lay on the ground about half the time anyways, but he has been using the bed more and more as time has gone on. 

My boyfriend has two little dogs who are super cute but still need some consistency in training. They have been staying with us in my studio apartment recently, my boyfriend is here for work. As the studio is one room, I noticed that his dogs are ALWAYS in my dogs bed, and my dog will be on the floor. Even if he starts in the bed, they will wiggle their way in. My dog will not lay in the bed if they are in it. I should point out the little dogs also have their own beds that are just normal doggie beds that sit on the floor. 

My boyfriend and I discussed the fact that his dogs are always in the big dog's bed, and he went out and got them a nice new  fluffy dog bed (big enough for both of them to snuggle up in, which they seem to enjoy) that sits on the ground, in the hopes his doggies would lay in it.....They dont give two craps about the bed and every time I look, one of them is ln my dogs bed and my dog is on the floor with his old man legs. I have been trying to train them to stay off of my dogs bed and use their beds so that my dog could lay in his bed if he wants. I have been trying to get my man on board with training them to lay in their own beds, but he gets annoyed with me. I know my dog won't lay in his bed every time he lays down, but I want it to be available for him when he does want to, especially after a bad leg day.

851,NAH,AITA for being mad that my boyfriend directed his fart towards my cat?,"I’m going to preface this story with the fact that this is a true (and playful) post, and that my boyfriend suggested we put this on here to see what you all think. 

Some backstory: I’ve had my cat for several years. He’s very charismatic, social, and a complete cuddle bug. However, since I’ve started dating my current boyfriend, my cat attacked him (unprovoked) twice. Once when he entered my home without me (with permission of course) and the last time was 5 months ago when we were laughing pretty and joking pretty loudly. Since then, all has been normal. Except... my boyfriend HATES my cat (understandably). 

Since things have cooled, I’ve tried getting my boyfriend to actively try and mend their relationship since I love them both and I want everyone to get along. He’s not about it, which is... okay. 

HOWEVER, last week we were walking back home from the store, and passing my living room window where my cat was sitting. I greeted my cat per usual, and started unlocking my door. My boyfriend who was behind me, just let out this insane ripper of a fart go. I freeze, and when I turn to look at him, his a** is pressed firmly against my OPEN window with my cat sitting directly in the blast zone. 

I yelled, DID YOU JUST FART ON MY CAT?! And my boyfriend would just not stop laughing. I wanted him to apologize, because I thought it petty and I felt bad for my cat, but he couldn’t do it without laughing and I’m still a little iffy about it.

852,NAH,AITA for “mansplaining” bread?,"

This happened a couple of years ago and I still feel embarrassed when the memory surfaces. 

I (31M) work as a lead photographer with a mostly female crew of stylists. I had just returned to work from a long weekend trip and was having lunch in the break room with my team. Typical small talk was occurring and my vacation was asked about. I told everybody that I had a great time in Random City and that we had so many amazing meals. I went on to talk about this one restaurant where even the bread blew my mind because it was so good! I said “They made this delicious bread called ‘focaccia’ which is an Italian pull apart bread with herbs that you dip in olive oil...” One of my coworkers at they table got an upset look on her face and replied “Wow, thanks for mansplaining. Are you going to explain the fajitas she’s currently eating next?” Everybody at the table laughed. I turned red, apologized, and finished my lunch quietly. 

At first I felt like TA, but the more I thought about it... she’s not a baker! I thought it was an obscure type of bread. I had never had it before and have been to many Italian restaurants. I always thought mansplaining was explaining something obvious in a condescending way. Like trying explain vaccines to a doctor or telling a mechanic how to check tire pressure.

I was still talking and seeing Beth. When she got engaged, she asked me to be one of her 6 bridesmaids. I knew she had a lot of friends and I told her I would not be upset if she didnt pick me and chose someone else because I didn't really care to be a bridemaid. She reassured me that she had already saved one of the spots for me and we even went shopping for bridemaid dresses together.   For the next several months I was hanging out with my group of friends more because they would arrange activities and notify me in advance while Beth would call me up a day before to hang out. Several times when she called I told her I already had plans and none of these calls were to ask me to help with her wedding. I did tell her to let me know if she needed help with her wedding  A month before her wedding, she called to let me know that due to seat arrangements, she had to cut 1 bridemaid out and that was me. I was upset because obviously she cut me out because she thought I picked to hang out with my other friends. I decided not to attend her wedding.

854,NAH,"AITA for vetoing naming a future child after my partner, even though that's a tradition in his family?","So I am not even pregnant lol but this came up recently & the discussion got kinda heated so I thought I'd ask the internet.

My boyfriend (26M) & I (25F) plan on getting married after the pandemic has subsided & will have kids in a few years bc I will likely have fertility problems after age 30 (family history).

I don't want to share real names but my boyfriend's name is a really common historical name that doesn't pop up as much anymore in modern generations. I'll use ""John"" for simplicity. His family has lived in our state for over a century & the first John [bf's last name] was the governor in the 1800s/1900s. All that to say it's become a small tradition to use the name John in his family.

He is very adamant about naming one of his children John. I asked what he wanted to do if we only had girls and he said he'd still want to name one John, or maybe a similar, more feminine name like Johnna. 

I am not a fan. I have a few reasons. 
1. I have always felt that I never wanted to have a ""junior."" 
2. My boyfriend's name is ""unique"" in that I've only ever known one person (my age) with his name. Like, he is John. That's HIS name. My family has never repeated names so to me, it feels like a person's name is important to each individual. 

My boyfriend's response to my counterarguments is that 1. None of the Johns in his family have technically been ""juniors"" bc they had different middle names. 2. He would be fine with the kid going by their middle name. There are two other Johns in his extended family rn but they both go by their middle names.

I suggested that instead we choose an individual first name & use John as a middle name. He said he really wants John to be the first name.

And his overall argument, which I do understand, is that we have a long-standing agreement that if we disagree on something, the person who cares more wins (this is not hard-and-fast but it generally works for us).

When he first made that argument, I thought about it and said fair, because to him it's a tradition he wants to keep going, and to me it's just an opinion.

But I've thought about it more and more and brought it up again, bc I think I actually do care at least as much as he does here. I have thought about baby names my whole life & while I don't have tradition as a foundation, it's still my future kids NAME and I don't want to yell JOHN & then have to clarify if I mean little or big.

I have a list of baby names that we both love & I'd just rather pick a name we agree on & is individual to our child(ren). I don't know if we'll have more than one (it'd be two max) so an obvious compromise would be naming one John and the other something we picked out together. But again I just really want all my kids to have their own names.

Also, our kid(s) will have hyphenated surname so it's not like it would be another John [bfs last name].

AITA here? My family has no naming traditions so maybe I just don't totally understand the sentiment behind it. I'd love to hear opinions.

EDIT: idk if this is relevant but maybe it is — I am not at all opposed to sentimental names. For example, my bf had a brother who passed away and I would actually really love to name a child after him, both to remember his memory and bc I love the name. Bf likes the idea but I personally wouldn't want to end up with one kid named after his brother and one named after him. Because 1. Then we'd be just straight up copying his parents and 2. Their two names together is the full name of a very, VERY famous person and we'd get jokes about it literally every single time we said their names. So kinda feel like we'd have to choose between using his brother's name or using his own.",2020-10-28 15:36:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jjq08b/aita_for_vetoing_naming_a_future_child_after_my/,188,373,0.93,0
855,NAH,AITA for getting mad at my wife for having a secret savings account?,"I found out that my wife of 4 years has been having a secret savings account. I just went through financial documents in our house because something was wrong, and I figured it out.
 
It opened up 4 years ago, and she’s been auto depositing 10% of her income every year. She’s saying it’s a completely healthy thing to do especially for women. She says that she wants to be secured if something happened to me or if I started abusing her.
 
I find that extremely illogical and that it’s pretty bad that she’s been lying this whole time. She’s been hiding $25k dollars from me. I put my money into our joint account, since we both agreed to merge our finances. She’s now saying that I can also put 10% of my income every year into my own account.
 
I then threatened to take 40% of my income(4 years times 10%) and put it into a separate account just for me. She’s now saying that’s financial abuse and called me an asshole if I did that. I honestly don’t see what she’s thinking. She put 40% of her income and it’s been accruing interest. 
 
She’s now staying at a friends house. Most of my friends think I’m in the right, but I don’t know at this point. They’re my friends, they’re more likely to agree with me regardless. I think I need to see another POV.
 
So, AITA?

Here's the story: last night, I was using the bathroom, sitting on the toilet and using my phone. This bathroom is only accesible by going through the bedroom my sister and I share, and she's sleeping. So I'm sitting there, and out of the corner of my eye, I see something come into the bathroom under the crack in the door. 

I look over, and it's a spider. This is where being Australian comes in. Huntsman spiders are very common in houses here, and these spiders are really big. Look them up- they're not poisonous, but they're absolutely terrifying. Especially if they're running at you while defenceless on the toilet. So the spider charges at me, and I panic. I started screaming, mostly inarticulate yelling, but also things along the lines of, ""WHAT THE FUCK"" and, ""GET OUT!!!"" In a panic, I leave the room, and go to the lounge room, where I start explaining the spider incident.

I was, unfortunately, very loud and animated with this discussion, not to mention the yelling at the initial scare. All of this woke my sister up, and I think scared her quite bit, and the next morning, she told me she got broken sleep and I was too loud, and I should have been quieter. I think I'm not the asshole because I was in pure fight or flight mode: it was me vs spider, and I completely forgot we shared a room. However, I see that it would have really freaked out my sister.

857,NAH,AITA for not telling my stepmom I disliked her as a kid?,"Kind of a weird one.

I (21f) met my stepmom when I was 6 and I'm not sure why but I never liked her. I acted out for a year, my dad nipped it in the bud and I treated her better after that. My mom died during their second year of marriage and she tried to step in and be more of my mom vs my stepmom and I mostly let her with some really strict rules. Like I would never call her mom and I did not want to be adopted by her ever. Other than that I let her do her thing and I did appreciate that she cared and that she and my dad were happy but on a personal level she is not someone I would have chosen to have in my life.

Over time the dislike went and it was placed by more of a neutral indifference that is still there today. I don't love or hate her and I don't like or dislike her. I am firmly in the middle. But I have respect for her.

My grandma, my dad's mom, has Alzheimer's now and recently my dad and stepmom were taking care of her and she started talking to my stepmom, thinking she was someone else, about how I disliked her (my grandma thinks I'm about 11ish) and how she (grandma) was the person I would confide to so I wouldn't get in trouble with her or my dad.

My stepmom confronted me on it and was naturally upset. She wanted to know if it was true and told me not to lie, so I didn't, and I admitted her I disliked her through most of my childhood. She then asked me if I loved her now and I replied that I respected her and appreciated what she had done for me and for making my dad happy.

She was devastated which I understand completely. Now she's mad and so is my dad. They're mad that I don't like her and they're mad that I actively disliked her for most of my childhood. My dad is especially mad because, to quote him, she stepped in to be my mom when I lost my mom and people are supposed to love their moms.

I was reluctant, and I openly told her I wanted to get it from a bakery so it would look all nice and pretty. I've seen my fair share of my sister's cakes and she still has a lot to learn, so i thought I would just get a professional cake. She seemed really upset when I told her my reasoning.

859,NAH,AITA: Sibling not oncologist,"Sibling not oncologist

Hi all. So 2020 blows and to add to it my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer, stage 4. Hardly any symptoms but cough and some weakness. Never smoked, hardly drinks, normal weight and in shape. So we are all surprised. My sibling is a dr (not oncology, non operative) and has basically been giving us info about what to expect and that dad had 1-2 years. 

Every time my dad goes to a dr’s appt my sibling breaks it down for us. What sounds like good news the sib will dial it down to neutral. Sibling keeps saying/implying they have a medical degree so they know more than we do. This has started to make my dad depressed. He’s been doing ok to well on the chemo but feels tired. Cat scan showed possible shrinking of tumors but sibling commented “there’s a lot we can’t see so don’t be surprised if other scan shows something different. This is stage4.” I got so fed up with sibling I said “You are not an oncologist, you are an ....(other dr). I’m an industrial engineer but don’t claim to know how to design rockets like an aerospace engineer. Stay in your lane and let’s think positively!”. Sibling got all quiet and said they were just being realistic. My dad thinks I’m being harsh but I feel sibling is trying to use their degree to play info-god. I’ve just told my dad to stick with what the oncologist says and not listen to my sibling. But I feel bad with what I said.

860,NAH,AITA for being “difficult” with an employee who wants to visit her sick brother?,"This is an ongoing issue and I would really appreciate some outside perspective. Please do not repost this anywhere else.

I have an employee who lives with me and my family. Long story short, she’s worked for my family for years so we let her move in with us rent-free to save money since we had the room. We live in a city where rent can be ridiculously high. 

About a week ago, employee’s nephew informs her that her brother was diagnosed with cancer. He hasn’t been feeling well for months apparently but was too afraid to go to the hospital until recently. They live in a town 4 hours away from here. My employee asked if she could take 5 days off to check on her brother. Normally I wouldn’t mind if she took a month off, but we’re not living in normal times. 

I told her she could visit her brother BUT she had to – 1. Isolate for a week, 2. Get tested before she comes back to my home. I told her I would pay for the test and provide a place for her to stay (I have a property with a small rooftop apartment where my maintenance guy used to live. It’s not a 5 star hotel room but it’s clean and has all the amenities she would need). 

Well she refused because she didn’t want to isolate for a week and she’s scared to stay there by herself. She didn’t say anything but I can tell she’s upset and understandably so, But I thought I was being more than generous with my offer. Her nephew texted me and asked me to reconsider because his dad really wanted to see his sister.  He admitted that other relatives and friends would be visiting as well (really?!). I have been doing my best to isolate since March because my elderly parents live with me and I feel like it would’ve all been for nothing if I let her come straight back to my house. 

I really think I’m being fair here but part of me feels like an AH for keeping my employee away from her sick brother. AITA?",2020-11-21 14:56:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jyc175/aita_for_being_difficult_with_an_employee_who/,52,135,0.91,0
861,NAH,AITA for telling our youngest child we can't pay for a private college anymore after some really big life changes?,"My wife and I have three sons. They are 25, 23 and 18.

My wife and I have always had good jobs and we always agreed we'd be funding most if not all our children's college.

So we had money saved for this purpose in our savings account. The older two went to the same private college I went to. It cost a lot of money, but my inheritance and our savings helped greatly. Our oldest is now pursuing a PhD program that is funded by the school.

A year and a half ago, our middle child was diagnosed with a very serious illness. Even with insurance, we are currently 160k in debt. 

Then, the virus happened and my wife lost her job and my income has been severely reduced. 

And as much it pained us, we had to use up our savings just to keep us afloat. The bills are still piling up and every single penny coming into the household is going right back out. This included the money we intended for put youngest's college.

My wife did a lot of legwork and was able to help get our youngest child a nearly full tuition scholarship to our state school. He'd be able to attend from home. 

But our youngest wants to go the same private college even though we've tried telling him the reality of our finances for half a year now.

As a last resort, we looked into loans but we were rejected due to our current debt.

We can't even sell our home and downsize because the house market has tanked where we live. And more importantly, our son is severely immunocompromised so moving around isn't the best idea.

Our youngest became extremely hurtful to us and we found out that he's been blaming his brother to his face that he can't go to his dream college because of him.

My wife and I ended up putting our foot down and said we are sorry but sometimes a family member needs more help at specific times in their lives.

We then told our youngest that in a few years if we've recovered financially, we'll pay his grad school in any school he wants. But we couldn't promise him outright because none of us know what the future holds.

Our youngest has confirmed his acceptance to the state school which is an excellent school. But he has now completely cut himself off from the rest of us at home.

He hasn't talked to us in a month now. My wife and I are heartbroken. We can't even afford any sort of family counseling.

Our middle son is extremely upset as well but this is guilt he should not be shouldering.

862,NAH,"AITA for ""ruining the Disney magic"" for my nephew?","I (30F) have two young nephews who we'll call Jack (5M) and George (2M). I see these kids every single day due to how close I live to their home and I'm basically their nanny.

For some unfathomable reason their parents got Jack really into videogames from a very young age and all he likes to do is watch Lets Plays constantly. (I'm not sure its healthy for a 5 year old to be that into fortnite but hey not my kid not my choice) He knows I also play a lot of games and just goes on and on talking about them to me and subsequently asks a lot of questions.

One day he was telling me about how his favorite youtubers were playing Five Nights At Freddies and how cool and scary it was and he asked me if animatronics were a real thing.

Thinking nothing of such a simple question I said yeah, the game itself is based on the real life franchise called Chuck E Cheese. I also off handedly mentioned that Disney makes some of the best animatronics in the world.

This blew Jack's mind and he went to watching all sorts of ride videos on youtube about the different rides in Disneyland that had animatronics in them and even started pointing them out to George and explaining to him how ""animatronics are robots that look real"".

Their mom found out about what I had told Jack and got pissed off because she and her husband were planning on taking the kids to Disneyland soon and now the ""magic is ruined"" since he now knows that everything is fake. She thinks Jack, being the little chatterbox he is, will ruin it for other kids as well.

I don't think I ruined his potential experience by inadvertently getting the kid interested in robotics in the entertainment industry. If anything I think I made him more excited than ever by the concept of theme parks and their inner workings.

AITA?

Edit: For people asking about why a 5 year old is watching FNAF

His parents give him unfettered access to youtube with ""child safety"" features on so I guess as long as the Lets Player in question doesn't swear in their videos then it passes the filter? I've seen him watching lets plays of other similarly scary games such as Bendy and the Ink Machine, Little Nightmares, and Dark Deception. Its a load of annoying hypocrisy that they let him watch that kind of stuff but then also get pissed when I tell him things like about all the various dangerous animals in Australia and claim I gave him nightmares about cassowaries.",2020-10-01 23:20:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/j3jmr1/aita_for_ruining_the_disney_magic_for_my_nephew/,296,4139,0.98,2
863,NAH,AITA for wanting my BIL to consider me?,"My husband (M21) is very family-oriented- which I love about him. I have never been close with my family for numerous reasons, so when I found out he loved his family so much, I was thrilled. 

We married this past June (COVID weddings- yay!), after a short engagement. His youngest brother (M16) was present to witness the union. 

His oldest brother- let’s call him Dylan- (M24) was not present. He had since been at training for the Reserves and, since we chose to celebrate the marriage til a later date, not notified until he received phone privileges.

Well, Dylan graduated in October and made a beeline to come home. I had briefly met him a couple of times, but not enough to truly know him. My MIL hypes him up all the time about how great he is and how far he’s come, which I understand, and I was ready to truly get to know my BIL better since he would be visiting his family while staying with us. 

Dylan came to our home while I was at work one day. I came home to my husband playing video games with him. I tried to be polite and make small talk, but he didn’t seem interested and looked more into his game. I shut up. 

The week went on and I distanced myself to let the guys have their “brother time.” It had been six-ish months, and they had similar interests I had no part in (sorry, just not a big anime/video game person). I felt like Dylan would get weirdly quiet when I was around, and the energy he gave off didn’t sit right with me.

While I distanced myself, I tried to be a good hostess. I sat with them and we watched a movie (Signs) one night and even cooked him dinners. Now, I get he was six-months-deprived of real food, but a “thank you” would have been appreciated. I shrugged it off and prayed the week would pass by, Dylan was slowly getting on my nerves. He would interject his opinion at the worst times, speak directly to my husband and not myself, and hardly made any conversation with me. I tried, but his body language made it clear that he was not keen in getting to know me. I was hurt, but whatever, he lives out of state anyway. 

My husband thinks I didn’t try hard enough to get to know him. 

I could be the asshole for not grinning and bearing my BIL’s stay, or for not starting multiple conversations. I legitimately did try to pry at him, though.

Well, Christmas is fast approaching, and Dylan’s recently purchased his first house. My husband asked Dylan for a PS5 for Christmas (which he can afford), but neither mentioned me. 

I’m fine with that, but what irks me is that my husband asked what Dylan planned on getting me, to which he stated that he didn’t plan on getting me anything since he has a mortgage and that he would be getting both of his brothers PS5s and gifts for his parents only. 

Dylan told my husband that he likes me just fine when hubs asked him what he thinks of me, but I feel like his actions are speaking for him.

Am I the asshole for thinking I should at least be considered?

EDIT: my husband recommended gift cards to him for a suggestion, to which he had the same reply/excuse.


EDIT: to everyone saying I’m an asshole because I “expect” a gift back, I don’t. My husband asked him what he wanted for Christmas, and he said nothing- but we are still giving him a $250 giftcard to a home store (Lowes, Home Depot, Homegoods, etc). That’s how the topic came up. My husband just asked him what he was getting me, and he said nothing, and my husband told me what he said. 

The problem is that he so bluntly told my husband he would get something for everyone, excluding me. It only bothers me bc he’s being inconsiderate.",2020-11-26 04:31:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k18d27/aita_for_wanting_my_bil_to_consider_me/,55,68,0.91,0
864,NAH,AITA for ignoring my roommate’s wishes about getting a cat?,"I’ve wanted a pet for a long time but it’s been impossible because I had a job that required constant travel. 

Now, my job has announced a virtual work option will be permanent, so I immediately set out to get a cat. 

I share a two bedroom house with a roommate, so I first checked with them and asked if it was alright if I got a cat. 

She was totally in on it and said she loved cats and that would be just fine, but that it desperately broke her heart to go through losing a pet, so if I was going to introduce a pet into the home I should be sure to get a kitten so she (my roommate) would be moved out by the time the cat passed away. 

Well, who doesn’t love kittens right? No problem. 

So, off I went to the pound to do a meet and greet to find the right kitten. Then... I was chosen by a senior cat. 

This may sound silly, but this cat really seemed as though it selected me. Before I knew anything about him, even his name, it was like, “Oh, look, there’s *my* cat.” No comparison between my chemistry with this cat and the others present, including the kittens. 

Major caveat — he’s eleven. I did seriously consider this and the agreement we had made. But I didn’t want to pick a pet, a tremendous responsibility and daily presence in my life, based on the opinions of my roommate who wouldn’t be doing any of the pet maintenance and who could move after any six month period. 

My roommate is very frustrated I violated the terms of our agreement. She says she feels she now cannot form a relationship with the cat or enjoy his presence because as soon as she becomes attached to him she’d have to go through the pain of the loss and it isn’t worth it. 

He’s a total goofball and loves affection, so now I feel bad I’ve created a situation where my roommate is stressed and where my cat is constantly seeking affection from one of the two humans in the house and getting snubbed. 

Plus, of course, we had an agreement and I broke it. It’s complicated because I feel it may have been justified in breaking it, but the basic fact is we had an agreement and I broke it. 

Better or worse, please be honest with me.

The massive window also makes my room colder and the tiny radiator is of little use.

I’m at a loss here really because even when I close the windows and the balcony door she opens them back up again anyway and she uses a fan.

867,NAH,AITA For Not Checking To See If My Boyfriend’s Meeting Was Over Before Walking In And Embarrassing Him?,"Throwaway Account

Last week I (27f) did something terribly embarrassing that could negatively impact my boyfriend’s (30m) job. I’m too ashamed to tell people I know so I’m depending on the kindness of strangers for their input and possible solutions. I’ll try to stick to the important parts because I tend to ramble but I’ll edit the post if more info is needed.

When the pandemic first hit I was temporarily out of a job but then able to work again, but at a reduced schedule which meant less money. Eventually I lost my job and I couldn’t even collect Unemployment because the paperwork was still being “processed.” I still had some savings and being able to not worry about Student Loans was a big help but I was still drowning. My boyfriend, being the amazing person that he is, told me to move in with him to save money and even helped me sell some of my stuff.

I tried to keep my head up because I knew that no matter how bad I felt I knew someone else had it worse but one day I just broke down. I was stressed and depressed and when my boyfriend came home he started to comfort me. I started to vent to him about my frustrations not really expecting more than for him to listen. After I calmed down a bit my boyfriend went upstairs and then came back with ring and proposed. I started crying again but for different reasons.

We‘ve been engaged since July and I’m still over the moon and since I have a lot more free time I’ve been doing the cooking, cleaning, and shopping while my man works in his office. When he’s in his office I know not to disturb him until after 6PM unless it’s important and to just text him. Last week he had a very important business meeting through Zoom during his last hour of work so I made sure to be extra quiet.

At 6:30PM, thinking that he was off the clock and just doing extra work I walked in with a plate full of food while wearing something NSFW and asked him if he wanted me to “polish the Dragon Balls” before or after he ate. My fiancé stared horrified and I heard a voice from behind request that I do that later. Turns out his meeting ran a little late and I jumped down and scurried away on all fours. My fiancé’s is going into to the office for a meeting with HR and I feel like I’ve messed up royally and don’t know what to do. I have a lot of regrets and now I just have to ask AITA for assuming my fiancé was done with his meeting instead of checking?

Edit for clarification: Thank you for the comments but since I’m starting to see a pattern I just wanted to clarify.

1.  My fiancé’s job was always good at ending at 6PM and never really went over before
2. When I walked in I was quiet, my fiancé wasn’t talking and I initially didn’t hear any voices so I thought everything was good.
3. The office is set up so that the back of the computer is facing door so I couldn‘t see the screen either ",2020-11-06 03:29:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/joxj6j/aita_for_not_checking_to_see_if_my_boyfriends/,119,202,0.89,1

I was dealing with lots of damage, to the point where I dont even remember most of those years. Now at almost 40, I''m much better now, with therapy and AA and my saint of a wife, but thats the important background. 

I was clear with my wife that its quite possible I have some kids out there somewhere, though a lot of the women I slept with I have no way of contacting to be sure. My wife budgeted in some savings for if we ever have to pay child support for a couple of kids, but just asked that I get a paternity test before we welcome them in. We have no kids of our own, dont really want any. 

Last year, a 16 year old boy contacted me, saying that I was his father. We'll call him K. K claimed to be the son of one of my old classmates, and that his mom had raised him by herself because she didnt want to cause any trouble. But she had told him about me, all the time, and he had spent a lot of his life googling me. He'd finally worked up the courage to contact me, and asked if we could me. 

Since I can neither confirm nor deny sleeping with his mother, I agreed to meet between our two towns, me driving about 5 hours and him driving about 45 mins, though I did tell him about my wife's request. He was fine with it. We met after the kit got here, he did the spit thing, gave it back, and we sat, talked, had lunch, and drove back home. 

We were not a match. I had my profile done a while ago, just so it was out there in case any kids found me that way. But K and I are not related. I contacted him, gave him all his data, and let him down gently. 

He was devastated. Crying, claiming it wasnt real, that he had spent his entire life idolizing me, that I had to be his dad. He begged to have a relationship, but I'm not entirely interested in building one with a random child. I apologized again, but left it at that. 

His mom reached out, begging me as well, saying that she was so sure I was the father, that its destroying him not knowing who his dad is. I said it was a real shame, but that father isnt me. I'm not dad material, especially not for someone else's kid.

869,NAH,WIBTA : My dying sister wants me to adopt her toddler but I don’t want to.,"This is a bit messed up; and a lot of people think I’m being a dick in this situation; basically everyone I’ve asked/talked to except my husband . I’ve never come to reddit for judgement before this but I’m at my wits end so here goes; 

My sister, let’s call her Blair, has lymphoma. Her situation’s been deteriorating and there’s little to no chance of her surviving this. Doctor’s say it’s only a matter of time before the inevitable. Blair has a three year old son with her ex boyfriend, who’s not in the picture anymore, i.e Blair has full custody.

I’ve never really been close to Blair, mostly because of our age differences (she’s 40 and I’m 31) but I’m close to my nephew. Two days back, Blair asked me if I would be willing to legally adopt her son after she’s gone. It was obviously a very hard thing for her to say and I totally understand her desperation to make sure her child would be okay, but this request came as a shocker. 

As far as I know, this particular .. situation had been discussed before between her and our parents, and they’d agreed to take care of [nephew]. She explained that our parents are too old (both are in their early 60s) and she doesn’t want to burden them with the responsibility of taking care of a child in their old age. Fair enough. I told her that I needed some time to think about it. 

First off, my husband and I already have two kids (aged 4 and 1) and it’s a hassle to take care of them even without adding another child to the mix. I don’t think we can handle another. Then, our expenses. I’m a SAHM and he’s the only one who earns; so we’d be fucked financially. My husband also isn’t entirely on board because of his own reasons, which is fair because this needs to be a mutual decision. I love my nephew, I really do, but I don’t think I can do this for him.

870,NAH,AITA for asking my wife not to see her doctor ex as a patient?,"My (35M) wife’s (36F) ex is a family doctor who, until a few months ago, worked in a big clinic a few hours away. He changed jobs and now works in our town at a clinic covered by our insurance. My wife told me she saw him on the clinic’s website when she was looking for a new doctor, because she doesn’t get along with her current doctor. 

My wife has a bit of a complex medical history, which her ex is familiar with. She’s had to change doctors several times because she tends to get ignored because several of her health concerns are fairly rare. She thinks he’d be a much better fit for her medical care, and would like to become his patient. I told her I’m not comfortable with that, which she thinks is childish and insecure. 

On the one hand...
She typically goes to the doctor like 4-5 times per year, so it isn’t like she’d be seeing him all the time. I don’t feel worried that she’d cheat on me with him - I believe her when she says that she just wants better medical care. I also have no reason to believe that he would be anything but professional. However...

Petty as it may be, the thought of my wife getting a pelvic exam from her ex really does bother me. So does the idea of her answering medical questions about our relationship (sexual and emotional) to him. 

There’s really not much else to it. I’m not really a jealous person, but I feel like I’m in the right to ask her not to see him. We live in a fairly big city so it isn’t like her ex is the only doctor available.

So, am I the asshole?",2020-11-27 04:49:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k1ulor/aita_for_asking_my_wife_not_to_see_her_doctor_ex/,47,42,0.87,0
871,NAH,"WIBTA for refusing to name my son after my partner’s late grandfather, who I never met?","I don’t give permission for this to be shared, sorry for mobile formatting etc etc etc

My partner has always had his heart set on naming his first born son after his late grandfather. He was always very close to his grandfather growing up and by all accounts it sounds like he was a really lovely, family man.

Sadly his grandad passed away when my partner was 16, it was the hardest loss of a relative he has ever been through and he’s always been honest about wanting to name a child after him. 

Now I have never been fond of the name, I don’t hate it but I really don’t love it, it’s very dated.

My partner knew that I don’t like the name but I never really pushed back on it until we actually started trying to get pregnant (as up until that point it was all hypothetical) at which point I asked if we could compromise by using it as a middle name instead, my partner was really upset and disappointed and it’s been a sore topic ever since...

The reason I think I might be TA is because it’s not like I despise of the name, and I know it would mean the world to my partner (and his family) and I feel a bit selfish saying no... but equally, I would be giving our child a name that I don’t like and it would be after a person that I have never met! 

I really don’t know whether to just suck it up because it will make my partner happy or whether to stick to my guns and insist we find a name that we both like and use the grandfather’s name as a middle name!

TLDR: My partner wants to name our son after his late grandfather. I don’t completely hate the name but I don’t like it so suggested we compromise by using it as a middle name. Partner is upset and says there are no other names he would consider calling his son.

872,NAH,AITA for not wanting my sister's stepkids to live with me?,"So this is kindof a long and complicated story but I'll try to explain...

My sister married a man who had 3 kids. I'll call him ""John"". 

The mothers of John's kids are not in the picture. The eldest sons mom may have been an illegal and they abandoned the baby with John (they were 15) and they don't even know her identity. The other boys mom passed away when they were babies.

My sister became pregnant and then married him having a baby girl just after the wedding.

When the baby was about 3 months old John had an accident at work and passed away. 

The step children are 16, 8 & 7. 

They had bought a home right before the baby was born. We had told them it was a bad idea but they bought a home that needed major work and ended up having a lot more issues then they thought. But he was very into handy type work and wanted to build it with his own two hands. But obviously didn't get a chance.

My sister was struggling financially. And the home wasn't really in any livable condition, especially not with children.

My parents live in a retirement community and while they are well enough off they can't really afford to support my sister and a mess of kids. My mother suggested/pushed really me to let my sister come stay with me until she can sell the home and get back on her feet. 

The house is a mess and I doubt she will get much for it and right now with all going on in the world who knows how long it will take. 

My husband and I are doing quite well right now and have a nice home with a guest room. I live with my husband and two girls under the age of 5. 

I told my sister that she could come and stay in my guest room with the baby. She asked about the other kids... And I told her there wasn't really enough room for all of them staying for so long. How would 3 boys, one being a teenager, her and a baby all going to fit into one bedroom!? She wanted the boys to stay in our family room. Which I think is absurd as they could be here for months, a year?! Or more!

And she accused me of being racist, which I am not. But I just am worried about having a teenage boy (of any race) that we really don't know in the house. She barely has even gotten to know these kids.

Wouldn't it be more fair for the kids to go live with their actual family who they have known their whole life? I know the grandparents were willing to take the boys in. They just lost their father and are now with a practical stranger and we have barely ever even met them. That has to be harder on them.

My parents and husband agree with me.

But my sister is refusing to even consider. I think she is definitely hurting herself and her baby just to spite everyone and be stubborn. Maybe she has some guilt because of John passing but she needs to be responsible right now and make more logical choices.

But when explaining this to my coworker they said I was an asshole (and suggested I post here).",2020-09-24 06:00:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/iyrnj8/aita_for_not_wanting_my_sisters_stepkids_to_live/,509,1647,0.93,2
873,NAH,AITA for telling my boss he basically admitted to underpaying me?,"I recently got a job offer at another company that will pay me about 50% more than I currently make, so I accepted it.  The commute will be longer and there are a couple of disadvantages, but the pay will more than makeup for it in my opinion.

When telling my boss the news, he asked how much I would be making and I told him.  He got real quiet and thought about it for a moment.  He then told me that he could pay me $5/hr more than I currently make and would be willing to let me work remotely 2 days a week if I stayed in the company.  Which, to be honest, isn't an awful deal.  But still, I wasn't biting.

I asked him if he thought I was worth that $5/hr raise and he said I was because I am a useful part of the team.  At that, I asked him this.

""If I am worth that much, how come you gave me a $1/hr raise at my last review two months ago?  You're basically admitting that you have been underpaying me and only want to pay me what I'm worth now because I'm leaving the company?""

He somewhat fumed and you could see him get red in the face despite him not raising his voice.  He said something about me not understanding how pay works, how it isn't just his decision, and how negotiations like this are a normal part of the business.

I stood my ground and told him that if he had given me these benefits to begin with, he might have gotten to keep me.  I told him that I wouldn't be able to trust that I was ever being paid fairly going forward.

Well, I put my two weeks in and that's that.  I was telling this story to my parents and my mom suggested that my boss had a point.  That these negotiations are normal and that I should have just politely declined the offer instead of making a scene.

AITA?  


Edit: I did ask for more at my review and argued I'm worth more, but he said he couldn't offer more and that covid has slashed funding all around.  I forgot to bring it up when talking to my boss.

He thinks it means I don’t actually like it. I told him just because he likes opening stuff right away, doesn’t mean I do and it has nothing to do with whether I appreciate or enjoy the gift.

875,NAH,AITA for not being able to afford to put my daughter through college when I was able to put her older siblings through school?,"I have 3 kids. 2 older boy twins that are 26 and one daughter that is 16.  I am a single dad because my ex wife left me and out children due to mental health when my youngest was born. Her parents did help out a bit at first but I haven’t spoken to the in last decade. I was financially stable when my kids were younger. My ex wife also worked, so money wasn’t a problem for my boys. Money wasn’t a problem when I was a single father either earlier on. I made good money for my daughter up until three years ago. I got hit by a car and I still experience physical trauma from it. I can barely walk and have immense back pain. I’m on disabilities and can barely work. I can no longer afford to send my kid to college without her having to take loans. I brought this up to her and she has told me that it’s extremely unfair because her brothers were able to go to college without any loans. I have asked my sons to help with her school but they’ve refused as well. AITA

Edit: I just wanted to add some details. One of my son can’t afford to help out because him and his wife are about to start a family and all of his extra money is going towards fertility treatment. I wasn’t aware of this before asking. My other son said it isn’t fair if he pays but the first son doesn’t pay and basically “what if my wife needs fertility treatment or I get hit by a car?” 

I think I may be the asshole because my daughter thinks I can downsize my life style to be able to pay for her college such as selling my car since I don’t need to go to work, or selling my home and living in an apartment/smaller home or cancelling things like Netflix, internet etc. I refuse to do either. I don’t think I have to suffer any further. I am wifeless and crippled for life. Is it wrong that I want to be able to drive to get my groceries and for PT? Or that I want to have high speed internet and Netflix?

I can also pay for about 2 years of college for her. I have 20k saved for her college funds. I had about double for each boy

Edit: Thank you for all your comments and advice. There’s some misunderstandings in the comments that I’ll like to clear.

1) All my children have lost their mother. Not just my daughter. My sons lost her at age SIX. They didn’t have an easy childhood either. So the idea that they had a picture perfect life while my daughter has some crappy life is incorrect. The first few years without mom was difficult for them that I I put them in counselling. My daughter didn’t remember her mom but when she was old enough, she was also placed in counselling. 

2) My daughter isn’t my care taker. I’m not so disabled that I need a care taker. I am able to drive, buy groceries, shower, cook and do basic things. My sister or sons come over when it’s stuff l that I can’t do like mowing the lawn. My daughter does basic chores like dishes, vacuuming.",2020-10-09 00:56:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/j7ph7n/aita_for_not_being_able_to_afford_to_put_my/,259,966,0.95,1

A few months ago I bought myself a cheap tripod for a class I'm taking. My sister wanted to borrow it for a class for a little while, so I told her she could, as long as when she was done with it she brought it back in the same condition she took it. I had it completely put away, so obviously that meant to bring it back to me all folded up and neat, so I wouldn't have to do it myself to get it out of the way for later. She brought it back to me still in full standing formation and said ""I couldn't really collapse it. I didn't try for super long, but I figured you could"". 

Now, later she's asked a few more times to use the tripod, and I keep refusing because she didn't do the one thing I asked for the first time. 

My Mom yelled at me saying I won't let one little mistake go, but I think that it's not just the mistake, it's that she didn't try in the first place to collapse it. 

So, am I the asshole?

877,NAH,AITA for pointing out that a friend has been spelling her dog's name wrong?,"This is a short one. Workmate (not a close close friend, but a friendly on Facebook and at work kind of friend) has a gorgeous dog - big chunky bulldog. I am a dog lover and we often exchange stories and advice about our love of dogs.

&#x200B;

For context, we work in a project team with a shared mailbox, and often I have to correct her spelling and grammar on official emails - otherwise it makes our agency look inept. Things like ""your welcome"" and ""I hope its not to much trouble"" have to be corrected by myself (as Keeper Of The Mailbox) so the joke is in the office that I am a bit of a pedant.

&#x200B;

Anyway, last week she showed me a sign she created for her bulldog to hang in the house - it was comprised of store-bought letter sculptures that had little lightbulbs inside and you can mix & match all the letters of the alphabet as you buy them per letter (like for kids' bedrooms and such).

&#x200B;

So her sign was ""ZUES"".  


I told her that the letters were lovely and would look gorgeous above his dog bed, but that she spelled ""Zeus"" incorrectly. She looked annoyed at me and stated that ""Zues"" is how they spell it, and she won't change the order of the letters of her signage. I must have looked amused/smug/condescending (or so she thought) as she has now decided to ""not bother"" with the sign and has been quite cool to me at work.

My fiance and I are getting married soon and are writing up our guest list. We both come from large families and friendship groups so have around 210 on the list so far, 60 are from his family, 40 from mine and 100 combined friends. We are struggling to cut the number down and also struggling with costs. My parents are putting in 15k and his parents are putting in 10k. His parents did the same for his sister and also explicitly told us that the money is for a wedding only ie if we eloped we didn't get the money.  I offered to them that if they had a special person they wanted included on the list as I wanted to be inclusive and show my respect to my new mother and father in law. They then came back with an additional 14 of their friends they wanted invited, who I have never met and my fiance has only met a couple of them.

I want to say no and limit them to a smaller number like 6 but I appreciate them giving us money for the wedding in the first place so I feel rude.

And I watched in horror as my wife literally sprinted away, pulling her hand free of Jacob's. He was frozen in place like a deer in headlights. The car got traction and swerved to a stop at the last moment and I ran over to Jacob. Emily was a ways away across the street.

I was furious at Emily for running, and I confronted her when we got home and we could talk privately. She started crying and saying she was terrified because her friend in college had been in a bad hit and run and she just panicked and ran. 

I said that I was terrified for Jacob too, how could she run and literally yank her hand away from him? She just kept saying she was so scared she wasn't thinking, and I was saying that I don't care how scary something is, my first instinct was to protect my son.

She stormed out of the house and went to stay with her friend, and ever since she's come back she's been refusing to talk about it anymore.

881,NAH,AITA for wanting my husband to leave his dream job because I don't feel safe living in the US?,"In 2008 my husband and I had the opportunity to leave Portland, OR where he’s from to go live in the UK for his work. I am from Europe and I wasn't particularly enjoying living there and had been wanting to leave anyway. 

We spent 11 years in the UK and in 2018 had our first child. Before I got pregnant, my husband told me that he wouldn't want to raise his child there. He was worried about the political situation in the UK because of Brexit and felt he had 'overstayed his welcome'. I never really understood why he felt that way - we were settled happily there, purchased a small house, had a nice group of friends. He had a good job and I was running a small business. The last 2-3 years of our time there he was very grumpy all the time, always making it very known how miserable and unhappy he was being there and how much he missed being in the US. He wanted us to return to Portland after the birth. 

I was very happy in the UK but I agreed that being closer to family was a good idea, that a slower pace would be better for us while our child was little, we could get a big house, his parents would help with the baby and things would be more balanced. He also felt Portland was a booming city now, with a lot of entrepreneurial opportunities and a vibrant tech scene. Reluctantly, I agreed. Within a few months, he orchestrated a move back to the US and a year ago we moved. 

For the first few months I worked really hard to get settled. I missed my old life but I was focused on making this life work. 

Then the pandemic hit. Right at the start, my husband lost his job. For several months things were pretty dire for us but over the summer he got his dream job. Then there was all the turmoil that went on in Portland - police clashes with protestors for weeks on end, a forest fire that left us trapped indoors for more than a week and all the craziness that is going on with the US politically. It is just feeling like too much for me. I am scared about what is happening to this country. I am scared about what kind of place I am raising my child in. I really don't feel safe here and it's really tainting everything. 

I have been telling him that I want to leave. It doesn't have to be back to the UK although that would be easier. I am willing to wherever there are work opportunities for him, as long as we go. 

The last time we spoke about this he reluctantly agreed to the idea of moving but wants to put a 12-18 month timeframe to it. Even though he's agreed, I can tell that is not what he wants. I am worried we'll go and we're just going to end up in the same situation as we were before where he was unhappy all the time. I feel terrible for backing out on wanting to come here, but it really does not feel like we made a bad decision. The US feels like it's completely imploding right now and I don't want to be a part of it.

So im going to put it in your backpack and when you get out of school let your mom know it's in there."" I had honestly meant to tell her myself and i probably should have. And i admit i shouldve thought the whole thing through better because a lightbulb in a kid's backpack even if it was in the box probably wasn't a bright idea being that it could break and possibly hurt her.

Right now I'm pregnant with another girl, and after I told the kids I said that they could help me pick a name. Vera suggested Hope and explained why. I thought that was very sweet, and I've always liked the name Hope. I told her I liked it. It wasn't a formal announcement or anything, I just said it in the car, and they both seemed to take it well. 

My husband didn't say anything in front of them, but he told me later he'd rather have her name be ""her own."" I just wanted to do something nice for this poor kid; I'm not jealous of a dead woman. But I don't want my husband to be uncomfortable with his daughter's name.",2020-10-14 14:33:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jb1sd3/wibta_if_i_named_my_baby_after_my_husbands_late/,153,1030,0.97,1
886,NAH,AITA for not going to my girlfriend’s sister’s destination or letting their parents pay for my flight?,"My girlfriend’s sister is getting married in six months across the country. Flights start at around $500 and the accommodations that my girlfriend and her family are staying at will be about $1800 to $2000 for the 6 days they’ll be there. That’s not including meals and every other expense.

My girlfriend is the maid of honour, so she’s obviously going but I can’t afford it. Her and her family recently made $100 deposits to book their tickets so they get the right rate in advance but I declined, saying that if I could go, I couldn’t pay now and couldn’t risk losing the $100 if the flight was cancelled or the wedding was postponed due to COVID (it was postponed once already).

My girlfriend is upset because she’ll be alone, even though I told her she’ll be with her family the whole time and super busy with maid of honour duties. I would actually be the one alone.

Now my girlfriend’s parents are insisting on paying for my flight even though I don’t want them to. They keep hounding my girlfriend about it even though she’s specifically said I don’t want that. Now they’re calling me.

I wish they would respect that it’s simply something I can’t afford and I’m uncomfortable taking money from them. I wouldn’t take it from my own parents. I don’t want to feel indebted to someone. I feel like they should also recognize that many people have destination weddings simply to cut down on the guest list. People decline for this reason all the time and usually the bride and groom welcome it.

I feel like they’re being disrespectful to my situation but they obviously feel the opposite.",2020-11-24 17:11:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k093o1/aita_for_not_going_to_my_girlfriends_sisters/,37,66,0.91,0

888,NAH,AITA for writing a book with a racist main character?,"I'm an aspiring author and decided to branch out of poetry and writing essays for the local newspaper into creative writing my and I'm currently working on my first book.
It's horribly clichéed and I am not planning on making any money of off this, it's mainly for fun and practicing my writing skills.

The story is about a 18 year old aristocrat man living in 1889 England who through some kind of miracle (ghosts. It's ghosts.) gets transported into 2015 England.
It follows him growing up and trying to adjust to the new England.
Since he lived in a time where literal human zoos where common he is extremely racist, xenophobic and sexist.
The entire point of this story is him trying to re-adjust  and aquiring new values.

Now, I made the mistake of posting an exerb of this on instagram like an idiot. The part I posted described him talking down to a POC and being confused on why they can talk back and why he is getting hated now. It's a learning moment for him and he's genuinely stumped on why equal rights exist.
It ends in him thinking about his actions and reconsidering his values.

And I got a LOT of flack for this. My comments where filled with people telling me it's gross that I' m writing about a racist. That it's insensitive because I am not black and shouldn't ever write anything about racism. People went through my post history where I posted my entire book so far in little pieces and kept commenting on how bad of a person I am.

And I just don't understand. I get that racism is a touchy topic and portraying a racist as a good person is a bad idea. But my character isn't a good person. He is flawed, he's a product of his time and he is learning.

Most people who critisize me haven't even read my story yet and just accuse me of writing about a racist and therefor being a racist.

So yeah, AITA and should I just delete it or are they over reacting?",2020-10-21 16:42:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jfgh08/aita_for_writing_a_book_with_a_racist_main/,212,207,0.91,0
889,NAH,WIBTA if I tell my fiancé he cannot use my saving for his student debt?,"Some background info: I grew up in an Asian family in Asia with the mentality that my parents would take care of me and I would take care of them when they grow older. Because of this mentality, there is so such thing of separate finances in my household. My fiancé grew up in an Asian family in America, and doesn’t really have such mentality growing up.

Last night, I was going over my bank statement and my fiancé accidentally saw the amount of money I have in my saving. He was so excited when he told me that I can use that money to help him pay for the remaining student loan he has. I told him I can’t do that, that money belong to my family (my parents and I). Well, he didn’t understand so I told him that the reason I was able to save up was because there’s a mutual understanding between my parents and I. I went to a state school near my house so I didn’t have any student loan, and when I got my job, I still stayed with my parents. My parents would still paid for the rent, utilities, food and such. I would then saved up 2/3 of my salary every month. I also helped out with car insurance and other expenses if needed. Even though the money is in my account, I considered it as my family’s saving.

He told me that he’s also my family now, and I should use it to help him out a little. I told him that I need to ask my parents, and even if they agreed, I can only help out a portion but not all. He blew up, saying I was selfish and that this is America, he and I should be a unit, not my parents and I. This is a place where I think I would be AH because technically we are not married yet, and as for now, I don’t think he can just demand it. Beside, even if we are married, I don’t think he’s entitled to my family’s saving. It is simply not his money. WIBTA to tell him my thinking on this subject?

Edit: thank you for all your responses. Some people asked if he’s the man I want to marry, and frankly I’m thinking about the same thing nowadays. When we were dating, I told him upfront about my family dynamics and he told me he understood. He knew I had some money saved up and put aside, he just didn’t know how much. He just completely changed after the engagement, I honestly don’t know what happened to him.

Edit 2: thanks for all your support. Some people asked if my parents had a retirement plan, and the answer is yes. However, considered how we moved to America less than 10 years ago, his retirement plan cannot actually support both my parents. My fiancé and I currently live with my parents, and my parents didn’t  ask him to contribute to any household expense because they considered him as part of the family (we didn’t ask him to save his money or anything though, he can do whatever with his money). That’s why it’s really shocked me when he didn’t consider my parents as part of our family. I am rethinking about our whole relationship now.

Edit 3: I know the notion of putting money aside for your parents sounds odd. Let’s me be a bit clearer, my parents never think that the money is their alone, I can use it freely if I want to. It’s for the future, and if I choose to use it for his debt, they wouldn’t mind as long as I discuss with them. They would even use their own savings to help out if need. If he asked and discussed it with my family and me instead of berated me, I am confident that we can work something out.",2020-09-18 01:52:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/iux4x5/wibta_if_i_tell_my_fiancé_he_cannot_use_my_saving/,303,5412,0.99,2
890,NAH,AITA for wanting my sister to share a gift she got 18 years ago?,"My sister has always been my grandma's favorite. It really showed when it came to gift giving. One year M got a dirt bike for her birthday, the same year i got a beanie baby. At 12 M got karate lessons, at 12 I got a book ""fishing for dummies"", Graduation M got a car, mine she bought me celebration lunch. You get the idea. M was not clueless about this and was happy to share her nice gifts with me. 

One year when I was 9, M got a telescope for christmas. I thought it was the coolest thing ever. I wasn't even mad that i didn't also get a big present, M and I spent a few months playing with it together. She eventually lost interest, but would let me take it out on clear nights by myself.I was not able to peruse astronomy or learn more about it at the time but i was absolutely facinated. 

Two years later, G got M another MUCH nicer telescope. It was in the $800-1000 range. M was a teen and ended up throwing a huge fit because she wanted a computer. It became a really sore subject, and she hid the telescopes away for over 10 years. I almost forgot she even had them till 3 years ago, she pulled the nice one out and we had a wonderful night looking at stars and planets. I've wanted to pick it back up as a hobby, I hinted about borrowing it or going out together more often, she told me that she dosen't find it as exciting as she used to. 

At the beginning of May, M gave me the first telescope. I was excited, but after looking it over I discovered it was in really poor condition. She had left outside for weeks at one point, stored poorly, missing lenses and stand, and it's super dirty. I want to fix it up, but I'm hurting financially because of covid. I've only taken it out of the box once to look it over, as it's unusable till I get at least a stand. 

A few weeks ago we had some stellar weather, and we live near a dark sky park. I asked M if i could borrow the telescope for a weekend. She got weird, asked me what was wrong with the one she gave me a few months ago. I told her what was wrong with it, as well as it being not nearly as powerful as the other one. She got uncharacteristically mad, said she knew it was dirty but nothing was broken or missing. She then starts acusing me of losing and breaking parts, and that she can't trust me to take care of the nice one and refuses to let me use it. It was unlike her so I dropped the subject.

I suspected something happened to it, she sold it or lost it and just didn't want to tell G.  However, i was at her house today and saw the case in the closet, so i know she at least still has it. If it was only broken I feel like she would have told me. She was really weird about sharing it as kids, but we're in our mid 30s now. She's used it less than 10 times, while I would have gotten a lot of joy from it. 

I'm upset by this while also feeling ridiculous for being jealous at my sister for not sharing a gift she got almost 20 years ago. Am I acting entitled to something that is not mine?",2020-11-09 05:28:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jqrset/aita_for_wanting_my_sister_to_share_a_gift_she/,56,217,0.96,0
891,NAH,WIBTA if I told my friend she had to grieve alone?,"I'm going to avoid too many details because I really do not want my friend finding out about this post. I don't know what to do here.

Last year, my best friend F(32) lost her husband M35 very suddenly, I don't think its right to go into detail regarding his death. He died on my (F33) and my husbands (M34) anniversary. Her husband died early in the day and she immediately called me and begged me to come be with her, which I of course did. My husband and I were also devastated, we were all very close.  My husband and I both were upset about having to cancel anniversary plans but that really came second to our friend's loss, so he understood that we couldn't be together on the day, but later once my friend was okay with being alone and everyone had a little breathing room, my husband and I did something small to celebrate.

Fast forward to this year. My friend still struggles with her husband's death obviously but is overall doing much better. She's in therapy and is starting to move forward. However, as I know from my own losses, the first year is the hardest, and the first anniversary is particularly brutal. Next week is the anniversary of her husband's death and she is struggling of course. It also is a big anniversary for my and my husband, 5 years! and we've made some plans (obviously nothing big because of COVID, but we can still make some great food and spend the day). However, in the past week or so my friend keeps bringing up what she and I will do on the anniversary, it barely seems to register in her mind that it is also my husband and I's wedding anniversary, even though she certainly knows as she was in the wedding party. She really doesn't want to be alone on the first anniversary of her husband's death which I can understand, but she never even asked me. She has just made the assumption that we will spend the day together (we're in the same COVID bubble).

I've spoken to my husband about it and obviously, he would like to be with me on our anniversary but he's said that he would understand at least this year if I chose to spend the day with her. Personally, I am super conflicted. She's my dear friend and I know how hard this has been on her, but at the same time its also a day my husband and I are supposed to be celebrating. I know that this day will forever be weird and bittersweet, but I'm worried about my anniversary always being in conflict with her loss. I really do not know how to navigate this, and I can't tell if I am being selfish by wanting to spend the day with my husband.

WIBTA if I told my friend that I was not going to spend the first anniversary of her husband's death with her?

EDIT: I've been reading all of these judgements, and it seems that the consensus is I should spend part of the day with my friend and the night with my husband which is something I had considered but was worried that wouldn't be fair to either party. However, after reading a few perspectives, including the YTAs, I think that spending the day doing some of the things she wanted to, and then trying to find a little celebration with my husband later is the best route. 

As for my friend I will make sure she knows she is fully supported, and I will speak to her and maybe some of the other people in our bubble to 'tag me out' if she doesn't want to be alone at night.

I own a small business and maintain a professional relationship with all my staff (not hanging out after work, etc). 

The other day, I was perusing one of the more popular porn websites and ran into photos of one of my staff. Not a huge deal IMO. We are all adults, it is what it is. I was planning on just sweeping that into the deepest darkest corner of my brain and letting it rot there. 

Here’s where I may be the asshole: whoever created the photo post gave it a very demeaning title and mentioned my employee’s personal info (first name, previous place of employment, city of residence). I can’t imagine my staff member green lighting that post but for all I know, that may be their kink. 

I obviously don’t wish to bring this up to my team member and destroy the working relation and negatively impact my business. At the same time, if the roles were reversed, I would want to know so I may take appropriate steps to delete it.

893,NAH,AITA for wanting pets my wife promised me we could get?,"So I (24) have had pet rats since I was a teenager. They were the greatest pets, and I loved them all. Especially in my troubled teen years, they were more of a comfort than I ever realized. This past year, my last rat passed away. I was absolutely heartbroken. We were staying with family at the time while we waited for our new place, so my wife promised me that we could get more rats once we were settled in our new place. We’ve been in the new place for a while now, and while our landlord doesn’t allow pets, she was aware that we had a rat and said she would be okay with small animals such as rats. I’ve been struggling lately. Up until this year, I’ve always had some sort of animal companionship. I didn’t realize how much it would affect me until a little while ago. My first thought was to try to get an ESA dog, but apparently the last tenant who did that didn’t get his lease renewed by our landlord. So that was an absolute no from my wife. And we can’t have cats because she’s highly allergic.

So I brought up getting more rats, and suddenly my wife doesn’t want them. She says she’d rather have a hamster, and I’m sure hamsters are great, but they’re not the same as rats. From what I’ve seen and heard, rats are much more social, which is something I need in a pet. 

But I kind of feel like a dick for refusing to budge on the rats. I understand that people can change their minds about things, but it just sucks because she promised me, when I was completely heartbroken over my last rat, that we could get more. So AITA for expecting her to keep her promise?

Also should note, she wouldn’t be expected to clean their cage/play area or purchase anything they need, it would all be my responsibility.

894,NAH,WIBTA for asking for an equal share of my sisters’ savings accounts?,"I feel like I’m being really petty so I thought I would put it to Reddit to see if I’m justified...

My (19F) sisters (Sarah (15F) and Charlotte(17F)) both were given a form of savings account by my parents when they were younger which they get access to when they turn 18 (I don’t know the full details, but when they applied for this type of account, I didn’t qualify as I was too old). Charlotte’s account now has about £2000 in and Sarah’s account has about £1000. Just to clarify, this money wasn’t put in by my sisters, but by my parents. Charlotte’s account has more as they intended to give me a share when she turns 18 and gets access to the account, to make up for the fact that I don’t have an account of my own. 

I found out recently that my parents decided I would be getting about £500, leaving Charlotte with £1500 and Sarah with £1000. I have to say that I was disappointed when I found out- I was under the naïve assumption that the money would be shared equally so we would get about £1000 each. I spoke to Charlotte about it and although she wasn’t necessarily rude in response, she said that she had no intention to share it equally. I’m currently at university, therefore this money would be really helpful to cover the cost of my accommodation, but I know that my sisters are also planning on going to university so I know that the money will be helpful for them as well. I would feel bad making them get less, just because I wasn’t lucky enough to get an account.

895,NAH,AITA for refusing to attend my mom's funeral because she refused to pay my college tuition and treat me the same as my siblings?,"Just to be clear, I effectively haven't had a relationship with her or my father in 10 years. They had an accidental pregnancy right before I started college and used what they had saved for my college on the new baby and some other things.

That upset me, but what bothered me more was that my older two siblings had their tuition fully covered. I thought it was unfair then and still feel that way, but I probably could have gotten over it if my parents had acknowledged that what they did was wrong and apologized or tried to help me in some way. Instead of doing either of those things they tried to justify what they had done by saying it was never their responsibility to pay for my college. They didn't believe I had a right to be upset.

Our relationship deteriorated quickly after that point. I was upset and said a lot of hateful things. I won't say they responded in kind, but what I said soured the relationship and they pulled back from me. I was mostly no contact during college but maintained some relationship so I'd have a place to stay when I was on break. When I graduated I told them both I didn't ever want to see them or hear from them again. I went on to grad school and have lived out of state since that point until I moved back earlier this year.

For the most part my parents respected my boundaries and didn't try to contact me other than to wish me a happy birthday or Merry Christmas. I never responded and stayed no contact. When I moved back home, they sent me a message through my sister asking to sit down and try to work out some of our differences. I declined and said I wasn't interested.

My mom has been sick for a while and passed away recently. I thought about attending her funeral, but I decided not to because she stopped being my mom when our relationship ended 10 years ago. I haven't felt anything for her in a long time, so I saw no point in attending. My sisters know how I feel so I thought they'd understand, but they both told me I should go (mostly because they thought I would regret it). I still refused to attend.

Now my sisters have told me I am heartless and an asshole and they don't want anything to do with me. They think that I am toxic because they don't believe anyone that can hold a grudge for so long is a good person. My finance wasn't as harsh, but she didn't take my side and thinks I've gone to an extreme by refusing to accept any olive branch.

I feel like my sisters don't understand. It's easy to judge me when you didn't have to go through the same thing. If they had they would understand.

I'm not sure what difference it will make since my sisters have already decided I'm the bad guy and not worth the trouble, but I will still ask if they are right about me being the asshole for not attending the funeral.

896,NAH,"AITA for not including wife in my sporadic ""me time""","Hi, I (30M, not native English speaker btw) have had an habit since I was 16. Whenever I feel like I'm stressed and I need a break, I close myself in a room with loud music and dance,sing and basically swing through every emotion I have. I can not express enough how much relieving that is.

I am usually a very controlled, introvert and anxious person, so this habit really helps me relaxing and letting all my emotions out: during a single session I can go from being on the verge of crying to letting all my anger and frustration out (not in a physical sense). Problem is, I am rather shy, so I am not able to completely ""letting myself go"" when someone watch. I do this when I need it/feel like it, but I'd say that it can happen at most once every two or three months, but often I do not feel the need to do this for, like, an entire year or more.

My wife knows this, but 3 days ago she told me she felt excluded because I basically close myself in a room for 2 hours, and the fact she couldn't come in made her feel like I don't trust her, so she asked me if I could avoid doing this, or if she could attend.

I assured her that it's not like I don't trust her, I consider that to be a ""me time"" stress reliever and I don't want anyone to see it simply because it would make me uncomfortable and therefore it would undermine the whole purpose of letting myself go.

She said she understands, but she has been cold with me ever since. So I have to wonder, AITA for wanting a little ""me time"" once in a while?",2020-11-22 15:27:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jyxec3/aita_for_not_including_wife_in_my_sporadic_me_time/,29,116,0.93,0

898,NAH,AITA for expecting help with my newborn while I recover from a complication packed C-section?,"I (23F) recently left my abusive husband and moved back in with my family. Shortly after, I had my baby. The entire pregnancy was filled with complications, and the labor wasn't much better. I ended up having a c-section. Luckily baby is completely healthy and perfect, but I am still struggling with recovery. I've had stitches pop, fainted, been diagnosed with vertigo, had my incision infected because the tape was removed too soon, and a whole host of other issues. Even a month later, I can't lift anything over 10 pounds and am not allowed to bend down past my waist. It's frustrating, but I'm in a lot of pain if I try to do these things, so I comply.

My sister (15F) loves kids, despite planning to be child free. Since she goes to online school, my mother works, and our father is dead, she's home more and helps me with the baby. She never has to feed, change, burp, dress, bathe or anything like that. All she has to do is if I have to go to the bathroom, or go somewhere where I can't see the baby, she has to come into the living room, and make sure her dog doesn't try to jump into the bassinet. If the baby cries, she just has to give the pacifier and if that doesn't work, she just waits for me to get done and tells me that she doesn't know why baby is crying.

Let me reiterate, I've never asked her to do anything other than this. She has helped me with laundry, but when we do laundry we do everyone's, so I've washed hers many times with no help. She's gotten annoyed a few times in the past, which caused me to not ask her, but my OB told me even if I don't have to pee, I need to try to at least 8 times a day as a full bladder causes pain and can slow down the healing. Ofc I don't ask her when she's doing class or homework, just in-between classes or after school, but I still get met with how I'm making her act like a parent, how it's ridiculous I can't even take care of my own baby, etc. It's getting to the point that I have to tell her how much pain I'm in, get angry, or cry to just get her to watch the baby for 5 minutes while I pee.

Today, she was basically saying that I do nothing for my child and she is the only one that watches them. All she does is sit on the couch, play on her phone, and cuddle the dog while I pee. That's it. She's not even holding them or anything.

I didn't want her to feel like I was making her be a parent, but I legit don't have another choice unless the dog is locked up all day until my mom comes home from work because I can't even bend over for enough to lock and unlock the crate since it's a little dog, and it's not like I can hold my baby while I'm trying to wipe or wash my hands. Am I being too unreasonable?

Edit: like I said, my sister loves babies and kids and was happy to help, and in return I'm doing more things for her like cooking, doing her laundry, helping with homework, etc

Edit 2: I'll be asking my sister if a baby gate to keep her dog out of the living room would be okay with the dog's anxiety. She doesn't get anxious in the crate where she sleeps, but I'd feel bad if she had to stay in there most of the day

Edit 3: It turns out my sister doesn't have a problem watching the baby. She just is worried I'm going to die of complications from labor and it'll be my baby's fault, so she doesn't want to get too attached to the ""reason"" I might die. I'm going to talk to my mom about having a family ""open mic"" kind session so she can feel heard and express her concerns.

899,NAH,WIBTA if I asked my daycare provider to reimburse me for the facemask her dog ate?,"My son (8) goes to an in home daycare provider after school.  Yesterday I picked him up and he was in tears. Apparently the daycare provider's puppy ate his face mask. My son put his facemask on top of his coat and bag as he does every day when he arrives. My provider went to take the puppy outside to do his business and when she brought him back inside he snatched the mask and swallowed it whole. This will now be the second time this has happened. 

I understand puppies chew/eat things but aside from the masks the puppy has also made holes in some of my son's clothes from jumping on him. 

This particular facemask was a school mask with the school's mascot on it and by far had been my son's favorite one. At this point I'm not sure if the school is selling them anymore but it was $10 when I originally purchased it.

900,NAH,AITA for accepting my step family when my bio brother did not and he was shunned for it?,"My father cheated on my bio mom, and abandoned us to marry my current stepmom when I was 12 and my brother was 14. He was frankly an absent father and I didn’t miss him much, but my mom didn’t have an easy time raising us as a single parent. She died two years later from an overdose when I was 14. 

We subsequently moved to and lived with my father’s new family, comprising my stepmom and her two sons (two and three years older than me). Going into this, both me and my bio brother hated both of them with the view that my dad was a cheating, unreliable scumbag and she was just a cheap whore. I wasn’t expecting to actually /like/ my step mom though we were right about my father.

Past the first few months of awkwardness, my step mom and brothers actually treated me great. They always wanted a daughter and sister respectively and quickly started including me in their family activities and looking out for me. My step brothers are also genuinely nice people and I am so lucky to have them in my life. My bio brother, on the other hand, didn’t take the move well and started acting out/skipping school/getting in trouble with the law. He didn't participate in family activities and moved out as soon as he could.

Recently I met my brother and he told me that he blamed me for “jumping ship” so quickly and not sticking with him. He felt that I betrayed our mom and him. He told that if I didn’t accept this family too, my dad would probably have packed us off to live with our uncle in a different state, and he wouldn’t have had to go through his crappy teenage years almost alone.

I’m 20 now, and I’ve always felt guilty about so quickly accepting them and leaving my brother behind. Meeting my brother only cemented this. Should I not have so quickly accepted my step mom and brothers?

901,NAH,AITA for being annoyed at my friends excluding my dog in favour of another?,"Back in August, I (28F) adopted a husky mix puppy (then 6mo, now almost 10mo). My friend circle was supportive and excited for me getting the dog, since I'm the first one of us to actually get one. There are four of us who are quite close: me, L (M31), and then T (F31) and V (M33), who are a couple.

L is 'Uncle L' as far as my dog is concerned. He came with me when I adopted the dog, looks after him when I can't, and adores the dog.

T and V have interacted with the dog a few times, but quickly got bored and annoyed with him. They said that they did not want the dog to come to our social events or on our trips (as we often go on long daytrips as a group). I have respected their wishes and have left my dog at home when we get together.

However, this means that I have had to decline some invitations for outings and trips when I can't arrange alternative care for my dog. I knew from the start that this was a natural consequence of dog ownership, but T and V have seemed insulted that I won't ditch my dog to hang out with them, although they also complain about my restrictions when I DO leave the dog at home (e.g. if I can only come by to pick them up in the car around 10am for a daytrip, as I want to give my dog at least 2 hours exercise before leaving him alone for the day).

Anyway. The triggering event is that I recently bought my own (used) car, primarily to transport my dog around the city, but it also opens up a lot of new possibilities for our travel-inclined friend group. Previously we'd just rented cars for the day, always with me driving, which was fine, but renting cars gets expensive, and the car shares in our area have mileage caps and rules against driving across borders (we live in Europe) that significantly limit our range.

The first weekend after I got the car, I was excitedly talking about all the day trips and weekend trips that we could do now that I have the car. V then asked me what I would do about the dog. I said, well, ideally, I'd like him to come with us on more active/outdoors trips, but otherwise, I have other friends who can dogsit. V said clearly ""I don't want to travel with the dog."" Which was annoying, considering it's my car and I'm the one driving us (as always), but whatever, I got the hint.

What annoys me is that *this* weekend, T and V have left for a week-long roadtrip in a neighbouring country (against strict COVID rules btw) with another couple... *and* that couple's dog. They've posted stories on instagram with the dog, including captions like ""road trip with the best doggo!"", with lots of pics of the dog. It bothers me a lot that they explicitly exclude my dog from trips that *I'm* driving them on, while seemingly having no problem spending a \*week\* on a roadtrip with another couple's dog.

Worth noting that my dog is not especially ill-behaved; he loves long car rides and sleeps though the whole drive. AITA for being annoyed at this?",2020-11-17 19:30:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jvzl4m/aita_for_being_annoyed_at_my_friends_excluding_my/,51,55,0.86,0

Point is that he's walking in and out in the buck while she's in there. He's in middle school now. He doesn't think much of it.

I mentioned this to my wife and she shrugged and said its not uncommon in her culture to do those things for kids at that age. She said moms even go into the boys locker room (she is Swedish) and that Americans are uptight. 

I told her regardless, he's too old.

UPDATE: Last night was the last straw. While my son was in the shower, she brought him a warm towel from the dryer. Like 20 minutes later, I walk by his room and he's buck naked next to my wife looking at his new aquarium. He was just telling her things that his fish did.

I spoke to my son and said he's too old to be walking around nude around his mom. I told him I would start helping him because it's okay because we're both boys.  He said he preferred. I asked why.

903,NAH,AITA For telling my wife her mom can't watch our kid anymore,"My MIL is 66 years old and retired a few months ago and has been trying to figure out how to spend her time. She's taken up a few hobbies, but nothing seems to really catch her interest. She approached my wife and I about the possibility of watching our 18-month old son during the day while my wife and I are at work. We currently have out son in daycare during the week and he loves it. We've had nothing but good experiences with our daycare center so far so I was hesitant to pull him out. My wife loved the idea of MIL watching our son. It would save us money and time since we wouldn't have to do drop-off and pick up. It would give MIL and our son a great opportunity to bond and give MIL something to do with her time.

I was hesitant to embrace the idea for a few reasons. MIL is older and watching an 18-month old all day takes a lot of energy. MIL is not in the best health and if something happened while we are at work, it could be hours until someone gets home. MIL would also have to live with us. My wife agreed that my concerns are valid, but wanted to at least give MIL a try. So we told daycare that we were pulling our son out for a couple weeks and used up some vacation time we had saved up with them so we didn't have to keep paying while he wasn't there. 

The first week everything seemingly went fine. We would get home from work and MIL and my son would be happy and playing and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I did notice that MIL would rest as soon as we got home, but watching a toddler all day is exhausting so I didn't really think anything of it.

The next week though, I came home during my lunch break and found MIL asleep on the couch while my son was on the floor watching a movie. I woke MIL up and asked what was going on. She said she must have just dozed off for a second but that everything was fine. My son was ok, but I sent my wife a text telling her what happened and that we need to talk about it. 

That night MIL was apologetic about it, saying it was only for a second and that nothing bad happened. My wife wanted to believe her and let her keep watching our son, but I disagree. I told her that I am not risking my son's health just so that MIL has something to do with her retirement. I said we tried it, it didn't work, and that I was going to drop my son off at daycare the next day. My wife tried to convince me to give MIL another shot, but I refused and told her that this is a one-strike and you're out situation and I'm not putting my son at risk.

My wife brought MIL back home and when she got back she said that MIL cried the entire way because she felt I thought she couldn't take care of her grandson. My wife said I didn't need to be so harsh on her and that we could have given MIL another try. I told her I was just looking out for our son and that I would rather hurt MIL's feelings than have our son get hurt.",2020-10-09 16:47:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/j82j59/aita_for_telling_my_wife_her_mom_cant_watch_our/,166,779,0.97,1
904,NAH,AITA for not wanting to be my brother's best man in his 3rd wedding?,"My brother (M34) first got married about 4 years ago to the mother of his daughter.  He asked me to be his best man and I happily said yes.  I stood next to him, helped him day of the wedding and of course, gave a best man speech.  Everything was great and it was a nice day.  Fast forward 6 months and they file for divorce.  

Not more than a year later, he is engaged and planned on having another wedding.  Again, he asked me to be his best man.  Of course I said yes and did all the things a best man does.  I was happy to help.  He doesn't have a ton of friends and he and I have always been close so I told him I would be there for him.  Fast forward another 6 months or so and there were already rumblings they were second guessing things and sure enough, ended up getting divorced, but not before having a child together (she was pregnant at the time of the wedding).   

So here we are, about 1.5 years since his last divorce and wouldn't you know it, he is engaged to be married AGAIN.  His fiance is currently pregnant with his 3rd child from 3 different women. His wedding is this weekend and just last week he asked me to be his best man for his 3rd wedding in almost as many years.  He asked me 2 weeks before the wedding!

As a married man myself, I am having a hard time supporting someone who doesn't appreciate the sanctity of marriage and what it truly means to take that pledge to your partner. At  this point I am not sure if I will be standing by his side for his 3rd wedding.  Some of my family agrees with my apprehension while others are mad at me for not supporting him on his wedding day.

905,NAH,AITA if I don't give dog back to previous-owners,"On Friday I answered an ad for a 5 month old dog needing to be rehomed. They wanted him to go to a place with property where he could run, we have a few acres, so I sent a message. It was a person that had posted the ad for their friends, we chatted a bit, then she said the couple thought it sounded like a good fit and we arranged a meeting for Saturday morning.

We go and meet the couple and the dog and chat more, play with the pup, etc. They told us that they were just not prepared for how much work a puppy was going to be at their age (they were older), they felt it wasn't fair for him to be living such a slow-paced life when he has so much energy, and that it was physically difficult for them handling him on walks. I could tell that the husband was especially sad to be giving the puppy away, but they still decided it would be best, and he came home with us that morning. Since then, he's been having a blast. He gets along great with our other dogs, the kids love him, he loves running around the property, and has just settled in extremely well for being here such a short time. We have all really fallen in love with him.

Which brings me to today, when the friend emails saying the couple called them to see if there's any way they can get him back. It left a pit in my stomach. I feel so sympathetic to the couple. I could tell that they loved him a bunch, I mean you can't not, he's an absolutely wonderful pup. But we have all fallen in love on our end too.

Background info: I'm in Singapore, and we have a law criminalizing male intercourse: ""Section 377A is a Singaporean law criminalising sex between consenting male adults."" -quoted from Wikipedia.

With this in mind, i have a son (25 M) who is gay, and is very open about it. He goes for Pinkdot, a Singaporean LGBTQ+ sort of pride festival thing (correct me if im wrong), is in a bunch if LGBTQ circles and he has dated about 5 guys now (last i know of). We haven't talked a lot recently as he moved out to stay elsewhere, and also COVID, but we meet each other sometimes as we stay in the same area.

Recently (Saturday) i saw him with his boyfriend on the train being really touchy-feely with each other in broad public daylight, and i could see some other passengers being kind of disgusted with it (note that we are a pretty conservative country, and the fact that we have a law criminalizing gay sex makes this whole situation worse).

My brother passed away a couple weeks ago. Before he passed away he and his fiancee were expecting to have a baby. They were really excited about it. Now that he is dead she no longer wants to have the baby and wants to get an abortion.

The most affordable clinic she can go to charges $450. She would also need $160 for a round trip bus ticket to get there (our state doesn’t allow abortions), plus travel expenses. That’s not something she can afford right now. 

I don’t have a problem with her getting an abortion is she wants one. I really do feel bad about her situation and I would lend her the money if I had it, but I don’t have that kind of money.

I do however have an old Yamaha motorcycle that’s worth about $1500. It used to be our fathers, so my brother left it to me.

I had a good amount leftover (Like 7-8 joints) so for the past few days, I've been smoking those at the end of the day on my porch with no complaints. Until last night.

Last night I got home around 1AM and decided to smoke weed before hitting the hay. As I was halfway through my joint I hear my upstairs neighbor scream out the window ""OMG! WHO IS SMOKING WEED!?"" and then their window slammed shut. I just sat there in awkward silence for about 30 seconds feeling bad, put out the joint, and slowly walked back inside. I didn't mean to upset them that much or have my weed smell invade their senses while trying to sleep. At this point, I am going to stop smoking on the porch to avoid conflict and if I see her I will apologize but was I extremely inconsiderate to do that in the first place?

My wife wants to take him because she doesn't want him to be in foster care his whole life and wants to make sure he is treated right. We already have a daughter and both previously agreed we only wanted one child  together. My wife wants to adopt him permanently but I don't want that, I don't want to sound unsympathetic or rude, but this other baby is not our responsibility. Am I an asshole for this?

EDIT: post has been up for 5 hours so sorry this is a little late I was trying to answer as many questions and comments as I could and read every comment down below. 
Thank you for all your comments and opinions and judgements, as is the rules I accept the judgement either way. I just want to say, (and I'm sure this is mostly understood already) I don't think my wife is the asshole for wanting this, quite the opposite really, the question wasn't about, ""well if I'm not the asshole then clearly she is"" we can both not be the asshole or we could both be assholes, the question was just if I am, which for the most part the majority agrees I am not but whether my wife thinks so is a different story. Update on that below in this edit.

Some questions being asked, that I've answered, and some with newer information;

The baby boy in question is less than a month old.

Our daughter is 2 and a half.

It would not be a financial issue to take him. It would cause some more stress but ultimately nothing we can't handle.

The mother and the father are both not available to parent the child indefinitely. I honestly have no idea if they are ever able to come back at a later date and claim him, I am under the impression that, no they would not be able to.
As for the reason why they are unavailable I would like to leave those details out, sorry. Just know that the baby will need to go somewhere and the parents can't take him at this current time.

Some people pointed out that by my post it seemed like I thought the only option is foster care, this was my mistake, I just meant the parents wouldn't be able to take him, so he would have to either go to a family member or into the ""system"". Many people made some great suggestions about adoption and the best ways for him to find a good home.

I would be willing to take him temporarily, the only part that bothered me was the permanence of my wife's decision.

I hope I addressed all the questions, if I didn't answer here or you've checked the comments below send me a DM.


UPDATE with wife:
Her original determination was based out of a strong emotional response to the reason the mother is no longer available to take the child, my wife was upset that the mother's actions caused this child to need the care of someone other than the mother, and in that response became adamant in her decision to protect this child because the mother is clearly incapable. She was determined to take him permanently because she was worried about how he might be treated with someone else. I've since talked with my wife some more and we have agreed to temporary custody for now, we are going to take the baby into our home for now and make a final decision later on, this is a compromise we both came to that we both feel is the most fair for the baby and all others involved. We want him to go to a good home, if that turns out to be ours, we shall see.

910,NAH,AITA for not being interested in giving Christmas gifts to EACH of my boyfriend's siblings and their partners?,"My (23f) boyfriend's (26m) family gives gifts every year. For our first Christmas (2017), not only did my boyfriend give me a gift, but three of his siblings AND his brother’s girlfriend each got me a gift. I even got a gift from their dog. I felt so bad that they got me all these thoughtful and useful gifts and I didn’t bring anything for them (other than gifts for my boyfriend and his parents).

When I got back home I told my parents and they both told me that I shouldn't feel obligated to give my boyfriend's siblings and their partners each a gift; giving a gift to my boyfriend and his parents was acceptable enough.

That was 3 years ago.

Last year, I got my boyfriend’s two brothers toothbrush heads and hair gel respectively, and the other remaining people items that I don't remember right now because that’s what they each had asked for.

Now, Christmas is basically in a month and my boyfriend's (26m) mother had texted a groupchat with me, him, his 3 other siblings, and each of their partners, asking to send her a Christmas wish list. That's 10 people to buy gifts for (which includes the parents and his sister's baby) when genuinely, I'm only interested in giving gifts to my boyfriend and his parents. I find it overwhelming to feel like I need to buy each of those 10 people a gift when in the past, I’ve only gotten my sister, my parents, and whoever I got for secret santa a gift.

(Also, his older brother started dating his girlfriend maybe two months ago. I'm not so interested in getting her a specific gift and I don't want her to feel obligated to get me a gift because we've never met. Also, from her perspective, I wonder—given the understanding that she's only dated this man for two months—if she feels obligated to buy 10 people she may or may not have met a Christmas gift.)

AITA for not being interested in giving gifts to my boyfriend's siblings and their partners EACH a gift? I don't want to give a gift just because I feel like I have to, I want to give it because I genuinely want to. Unless this is what all couples do and maybe I didn't know? (He's my first boyfriend). I would maybe give gifts to his siblings if they were younger and I were pretty close to them and saw them all the time, but I just feel overwhelmed—even after 3 years of Christmas—to feel like I need to buy 10 people a gift when I already struggle getting gifts for my own family.

Edit: Due to the pandemic, I wouldn't be going to his family's holiday party with the immediate family.

He was still a toddler in this pics but it was definitely him and my father. He's quite a bit younger than me, so that means it was during the period of time after my father left our family and disappeared. 

He contacted me and wanted to meet me online or even in person if I was comfortable with it. He wrote a really long message about how excited he was to finally find someone that knew more about his father than his mother. According to him he wasn't planned but father stuck around with them for about 3 years before he died. 

I said that it was nice to know that I have a step sibling out there, but that I have no interest in meeting him. He sent me walls of text begging me to talk to him about his father so he can understand him more. I still told him no.

The main reason I don't want to is because my father was an abusive alcoholic asshole. Every time he came home from work, the joy felt like it was sucked out of the house. I really don't feel comfortable typing about it. That's why I don't want to meet the guy. I can't have my father crush another kid's spirit.

He’s constantly avoiding me, if I have to drive him somewhere he’ll put on his headphones and sit in back seat to avoid talking to me, we used to talk about random things all the time. Now he won’t even come downstairs to eat dinner if I’m home too and barely talks to me, only if it’s really necessary he’ll say few words.

I tried to talk to him few times, but again he’ll either avoid me or lock himself in his room or say that I’m imagining stuff. My wife has noticed it too.

I’ve been pretty irritated about it. We planned to go on a trip few months ago, We were all excited about it but now I don’t think that anyone will enjoy it.

Her energy levels are low and she is weak and gets dizzy often so it is dangerous to get her up if she’s having a bad day or is unprepared. 

The other day, a couple of her friends came over. They used to be physical therapists, so they like to get her up even if she doesn’t want to, and they often try to “teach” me how to get her up even though I live with my grandmother and have previously worked in a nursing home. When they got her up the other day, however, they moved her bed and it messed up one of the power strips and turned off the power to her bed, her oxygen, her lamp, her clock, everything. I believe they also moved the bed without taking the brakes off, because now the bed moves even when the brakes are on which is extremely dangerous when she goes to stand and put pressure on it. I’m worried that it will slip and she will fall onto the floor. 

I would like to tell them to stop getting her up. They don’t see her every day, they don’t know how much she struggles with very basic tasks. All they know is that she doesn’t get up very often and they think she should. However, I know they are just trying to be helpful. I also feel like my grandma would be mad if I told them to stop, because she would see it as being rude. It just stresses me out a lot, and I get overwhelmed with the amount of care that I have to provide for her and I wish I didn’t have to worry about her visitors putting her at a potential risk. So WIBTA if I asked them to stop?

EDIT: a lot of people seem to think that this is inferring that she doesn’t get up or move at all. She is on hospice, she has nurses check on her regularly. She does get up, just not as often as she used to. Her heart is also weak. She does do exercises. She does change positions. She does not sit in the same position all the time.",2020-11-25 17:39:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k0wqe5/wibta_if_i_told_these_people_to_stop_getting_my/,26,33,0.88,0
914,NAH,AITA for not wanting my mom's boyfriend to do my laundry?,"I'm a 28yo female for context.

My mother works in a different city, so she's really only home during the weekend. As a result I pretty much operate as if I live by myself, which sometimes includes leaving my laundry in the dryer overnight depending on when they finish washing. Since I leave for work extremely early in the morning, I don't always take my clothes out of the dryer when I wake up.

Anyway, yesterday my mom's boyfriend came by the house to drop off my mom's dog so she didn't have to worry about trying to drive 4 hours home and worry about said dog at the same time. During that time, I guess when getting the dog settled (she sleeps in the laundry room) he noticed my clothes in the dryer and took them out and folded them. 

I'm not saying it wasn't a nice gesture, it's just that I have issues with the guy, and he's still a relative stranger handling my underwear and bras. It's not like I have any sexy underthings, it just creeps me out to know that a man who isn't related to me, isn't a part of the family, and who I had no idea was even in the house to begin with was handling my underthings. Mom is saying I'm being dramatic, that he has two daughters and it doesn't mean anything, but I'm still a little weirded out by it.

So, am I being a bit of an overdramatic butthole here?",2020-11-24 20:57:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k0dlxv/aita_for_not_wanting_my_moms_boyfriend_to_do_my/,34,28,0.91,0
915,NAH,AITA for being upset when my dad called me a pig for eating icecream?,"so this all happened last night, it involved my dad, me(f16) and my sister(f14)

bit of backround, i developed an e*ting disorder when i was around 12, my dad found out last year because i lost so much weight (i went from being a little over 100 to 89lbs in a few months) im seeing a therapist and currently in recovery but he knows i have a bad relationship with food. 

So sunday night my dad bought a 2L of icecream, me being on my period had three bowls. Im not sure how much my sister had, but we both had the majority of what was in the tub. Last night i was about to make burgers for my sister and i for super, my dad came into the kitchen and took out the ice cream tub from the freezer. 

dad: “Holy shi- theres like nothing left in here! jeez you guys are pigs”

My sister and i were upset from this comment, we both basically just said 

“WOW thank you”

and went up stairs, i took the burgers off the stove because we both didn’t want to eat after that. He came into my room and i was crying so i wasnt looking directly at him, he said he “didn’t mean it in that way” and “what else was he supper to say” i was yelling/crying, saying he shouldn’t have called us pigs. He then said “whats the big deal” and i just wanted to yell at him that i have an e*ting disorder...but i didnt. 

He said he was sorry, but also basically said that my sister and i were being overly emotional/dramatic. I wanted to know if we were actually being over dramatic

edit:
just to add, whenever he buys icecream he normally has some the second we get home, so i genuinely thought he already had some. And it isn’t abnormal for me to usually have 2-3 bowls anyways, so i never went over what i would normally have.

also another thing, i still very much have anorexia. I only started recovery at the beginning of the pandemic because being underweight puts me at risk. I still have negative thoughts about eating food and about my body, i struggle to eat and the only reason i do is because i dont want to die from covid

final edit: i forgot to add that after that ordeal, my dad said he’s never going to buy things like ice cream again? Idk if that was true or not, if it is i thinks its kinda harmful, seeing as he’s basically punishing someone with anorexia...for...*eating*

ive taking that im not the asshole, but that i should be more considerate. I will say that if i were not on my period i wouldn’t have eaten 3 bowls. Because when i am on it i completely lose my appetite and only crave sweet things and the thought of any other foods makes me feel sick. But jeez, yall really need to learn more about eating disorders and how harmful it is to insult someone with the illness after eating",2020-10-28 18:44:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jjtojk/aita_for_being_upset_when_my_dad_called_me_a_pig/,133,101,0.87,0

917,NAH,AITA because ALL of my online dating photos have fake backgrounds?,"Yes, they all have fake backgrounds. I'm not a good photographer and neither are any of my friends, we don't have professional cameras or even good phones.   


What I have done is ""recreate"" photos that I actually have, but using a fake background found on the internet, and photoshopping in a pic of me that I have taken myself in my house. Like for example I have real pics of me against the NY skyline that are low quality and not flattering. I find pics online of that same angle that look amazing, and take a flattering pic of myself in the same pose inside my house, and then photoshop it.   


Even for the photos that aren't direct recreations, all of them are places that I've actually been to, with a couple exceptions.   


The exceptions are colorful patterned backgrounds. Like it could be a mural or it could be a room with interesting wallpaper. I have photoshopped myself into those even if I haven't physically been there ever because they aren't landmarks or things known to be in a specific city.   


I haven't done any altering on the photos of myself that I photoshop into these backgrounds. So the way I appear in these pics is very accurate. It's just a better way of framing myself.   


Since I have been doing this I have gotten wayyyyyyyy more matches even though my personal appearance hasn't changed.   


Nobody has directly asked me about the pics before, they will ask me things like, ""so I see you have been to New York, how was it?""  


However, one date did end up asking about a pic that was taken in a colorful room. He asked where that room was. I was honest and said I didn't know, I just photoshopped myself into it because I liked it. He then directly asked if I did that with all my pics and I said yes. I thought it would be funny or at worst, a bit quirky but he was really, really angry. He said I was a huge asshole for doing that. I thought that was way overboard because I didn't alter anything about my own appearance. He said it didn't matter and he never would have gone out with me if he knew the backgrounds were fake.

However given the current events, she pads the time she has available to stay on the pulse of the election. She gets pretty wound up. She tells me she's going to take a bath with a bath bomb and try to go to bed. I respond with a text saying 

""Okay, try not to think about the election and just enjoy your bath. Maybe put on some nice music""

She responds with:

""It's impossible not to think about it. It's honestly the most important thing happening right now and the outcome will determine whether there is a huge reason to be hopeful for the US in the next couple of years. Most people are pretty concerned. I'm not someone who does well with just pretending issues don't exist or trying to forget them temporarily by force. It's stressful but honestly sometimes it's normal and a healthy response to be stressed. What isn't healthy is deny that problems are real or that something is really worrisome, or trying to box up unpleasant feelings""

My response:

""Okay, I was just wishing you enjoy your bath to the best extent possible""

Her reply:

""I get it, but please don't tell me what to think about or what to try not to think about. That really bothers me.""

Cue her to actually call me to further tell my why I should never tell her what to think (which wasn't my intent), even though in my mind the the conversation was done by my second message. I get called controlling, which sets off a fight, which she demands an apology for which I don't see why I need to apologize for anything really.

920,NAH,AITA for telling my sister she can’t go out in revealing clothes?,"So my parents are out of town for a few weeks on a business trip and I (17m) have to look out for my sister (13F). Yay. 

Anyhow, she wanted to go out to a thing with some friends of hers, which is fine with me because I was planning on having some friends over later anyways and don’t want her in the way. 

Her thing consists of going to the mall to shop (which I wasn’t aware was still a thing lol, I assumed everyone bought clothes online, but good for people who have that kind of patience) with some friends. She was planning on heading over to her friend’s house as soon as school ended, which was like 30 minutes ago. Anyhow, she came out wearing a super revealing outfit (which she never would if our parents were around), and I told her to change as to not attract creeps.

She said that if people creeped on her, they were the wrong party morally rather than her. I really don’t see how that matters. That’s like walking across a dark ally af night thinking ‘if I get mugged and knifed it’s their fault for mugging me’. At the end of the day you’re getting mugged, and that’s kinda what matters.

921,NAH,AITA for not getting vaccinated?,"When I was 12 (F) my mom told me about the gardasil vaccination series, + how it was for cervical cancer but said that I didn't need it since I wasn't having sex. And that it was ridiculous to give a vaccination to children because children weren't sexually active (yes, not all sexual contact is consensual so there is definitely that).

Anyway, when I was 16 I went to the gyne (my mom was in the room) for a checkup, my gyne asked whether I'd done the vaccination series and I said no (at that point I'd also read a couple of articles that talked about girls getting very sick from it) she assured me of its safety, and explained that the people who'd gotten sick were usually around the age when autoimmune disorders starting surfacing anyway. Still didn't get the vaccine (misinformation + I wasn't having sex and felt awkward about the vaccine with my mom there). 

Now (20) I realise the value of the vaccine (now gardasil9) and wanted to get it before lockdown, and have my (15M) sibling get it too (it prevents HPV + related cancers like oral, penile, and anal cancers, and stops men from being carriers). Due to lockdown we couldn't. And now, my mom doesn't want him to get it until next year ""in case something goes wrong."" I then said we would be looking out for our health. And she told me that I was the one who didn't want it in the first place, so I corrected her and said that she told me I didn't need it when I was 12 (because only people who have sex with lots of people need it) and I felt weird about it long after (although I did have the opportunity again at 16, and declined. Which I admitted. But imo, she was the parent, and fully could've given me the vaccine at 12, and then today's conversation would only have been about my brother getting it. I do understand that everyone does what they think is right at the time, and brought it up bc she blamed me). She then told me that I ""always blame"" her for everything/ ""everything is always"" her fault according to me, and started crying. 

AITA?

Edit: to be clear, she doesn't have an issue with us getting the vaccine now, it was perfectly fine that we would both get it. The disagreement came from her suggesting it was my fault I hadn't been vaccinated in the first place, and me bringing up that she made that decision. Which resulted in her saying that I blamed her for everything/everything was always her fault and her crying (for hours). Just so everyone knows there was no yelling, that's a boundary for me. 

Both of my parents keep talking about how I can't take responsibility for my own actions, and how I blame them and criticise them for everything (I hate when people talk in ""always"" and ""everything"" kind of statements but not the point). I feel justified in my stance, and rather emotionally reactive (on an internal level but self control ya know), but am also concerned that I'm fooling myself and am 100% in the wrong.",2020-11-22 09:08:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jysrrs/aita_for_not_getting_vaccinated/,33,39,0.87,0
922,NAH,WIBTA for asking to pause my engagement after finding out my partners financial situation,"I have been struggling how to put this problem into words without making it sound like a stupid first world problem and I just don’t know anymore so here it goes. 

I’ve been dating this great guy for 6 years. He is a single father to 3 amazing girls (his first wife died several years ago) 

Before the world went to trash he took me out to a very fancy dinner and asked me to marry him, the girls then came out and asked me to be their mom. And they all presented me with an amazing ring he told me was a family ring. I said yes. 

Shortly after they all went back out west to help his parents settle somethings with the family company. 

They recently came back, finished their isolation and got tested to be safe. And he came to see me as just said that he wanted to talk. 

Well he dropped a bombshell that what I thought was a small family company is actually a million dollar tec company. I was shocked. 

He never acted or looked rich. He and the girls live in a nice standard family home for the area and wear nice clothing but it’s not like I have ever seen him/the girls/ items in his house that would be considered luxury brands. When we went out we would always sneak snacks into movies, pack a lunch bags Togo,split bills, fly economic etc

He said he never told me because he wanted to find love again with someone that cared about him and his girls, not his money. 

He then went on about how the trip back was really to set up the main house for us. I had already planned on moving with him once we got married so that was not the problem. But now he tells me I can be a house wife and just do whatever I want to be happy. 

I still love him but I feel like now there is so much I don’t know about him and I want to just put a pause in the engagement and get to know him again. 

I told this to my friends and they all say I WBTA if I did so cause then I’m confirming his fear that money would play a role in our relationship and that I should understand why he lied. 

He and the girls are already in full wedding planning mode and I don’t want to hurt them. Especially the girls as they have already lost so much. My friends tell me I should just move forward and if that even asking them to wait would make me a monster since they all clearly love me and I love them.

So WIBTA if I ask to slow things down. I still want to be with him but I feel like I need to get to know this part of him too. But everyone around me is saying to just go forward as normal as to not rock the boat but this feels anything but normal.

Edit: I’ve lost parts as I kept trying to put this all in to words so to respond to many questions. He does not expect me to be a house wife. But I can if I want. I love my job but we have talked about it before that working does not leave me with much time to do the other things I enjoy. He says he just wants me to be happy so if that means I don’t work and can do for example more volunteer work then he had no problem with that and will fully support me.

Also people say a million dollar company is not that much in perspective. Truth is I don really know still he showed me the net worth and stock info for the company/family/him but I don’t understand it all. When he explained it again to me he said that if he lost a million dollars walking down a street he would not even bother looking for it. So while I say million I still don’t really know or understand but that’s just another problem I’m having right now.",2020-08-12 21:39:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/i8mvd4/wibta_for_asking_to_pause_my_engagement_after/,1081,6668,0.96,1

924,NAH,AITA for crying over not liking my engagement ring?,"So I’ve(27F) been with my now fiancé(29M) for 7 years. A couple weeks ago he proposed to me. Everything about it was perfect. It was simple but sweet and how I always imagined myself getting engaged. I had actually told him my dream proposal so early on in our relationship and he remembered it! Best day of my life.

In the moment I was so happy I barley even looked at the ring cuz at the time all that mattered was I was with him and happy. 

But after actually looking at it I hate it. It’s everything I hate in an engagement ring and I was honestly surprised at how much I hated it. I do not want to describe the ring because I do not want to hurt anyone’s feelings that has a similar looking ring! 

I was actually kind of surprised he went in this direction and found myself feeling a little emotional about it. I ended up crying in the bathroom to myself when I thought my fiancé wasn’t around. Of course he heard me and being concerned he came in and asked me what was the matter.

At first I tried to play it off that I was just emotional about being engaged but him knowing me so well he did not believe me. He pushed me further on it and finally I just told him I did not like the ring and I was just a little sad. 

He got super defensive about it. We argued and he ended up calling me ungrateful because he spent a lot of money on the ring. I told him I was grateful and happy he put so much thought into it but I just didn’t like it. He asked for it back and said he would do something about it and I gave it to him. He’s still pretty angry at me about it though and every day since we have gotten into an argument about it. He won’t tell me what he did with the ring or if I’ll get a new one or that one back. At this point I really don’t know what to do.

925,NAH,AITA for wanting to get my hair and makeup done professionally for my brother’s wedding?,"Please don’t post on Twitter!
 
Me (28F) and my sister (26F) are bridesmaids in our brother’s (31M) wedding. Our future SIL (28F) asked us to be in the wedding and we’re super excited. Wedding is in two months and with COVID and them buying a house, not a ton of planning for the wedding has been going on – they are very go with the flow, whatever happens, happens. But the wedding is at a nice resort in the Canadian mountains, and our bridal dresses are pretty fancy.
 
All this being said, SIL posted in the bridal party chat that she has a friend (who is not a professional) coming in to do our makeup, but that for the most part we’d be on our own and can help each other out with getting ready. There would be 11 of us, by the way. Sister and I were hoping to get makeup and hair professionally done, but when we mentioned we wanted to go and do that early in the morning and be back with plenty of time, SIL got really upset. We then tried to compromise and ask if a second person can come in and do our hair, because 11 people is A LOT for one person to do makeup for.
 
Long story short, our brother called us and berated us for two hours, basically saying that we have to do what SIL wants because it’s her wedding, and if she wants one person to do 11 people’s makeup and for us to do our own hair, that’s it. He says that this is a “group” thing, and we have to look the same as everyone else. Even after we suggested we pay for this hair person to come in and help us out, at no cost to her. (SIL also took on the expense of her makeup artist friend, when we told her that it’s usually not standard for the bride to pay for everyone getting ready).
 
Are we the assholes for wanting to get our hair and makeup professionally done for our brother’s wedding?

926,NAH,AITA for not wanting my cousin's prison (pen pal) girlfriend to become part of our family?,"For context, you can read [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hdrlk5/serious_for_those_who_have_a_murderer_in_their/fvmxc9p/?context=3). I'm just gonna say that I don't need any takes on my cousin's crime, imprisonment, or his humanity. I simply want opinions on the below matter.

My cousin has been in prison for a long time (12 years), and won't be out for *at least* a decade. He's got a good support system, friends & family. I guess he misses having more people in his circle, because he'd put up an ad on one of those prison pen pal sites about 1,5 years ago. A lady had replied, they'd started writing each other letters, and boom, somehow they became romantically involved. (Important note: the website my cuz was on shows his crime, and his criminal history is also easily searchable with his inmate number. So this lady knows full well what he's in for.)

His mom mentioned a ""lady friend"" to us around last Christmas, and we were amused by the news. A random lady wanting to get to know a random inmate? We also found it somewhat endearing. We do love him and I'm personally unable to believe that he is an evil being unworthy of love.

However, things have escalated. These two are apparently now a couple. They maintain their relationship through letters, calls and visits.

She is now very eager to ""become part of our family"". She's added all of us on social media. She's got 3 kids, and she hopes that we accept them. We're doing a big video call for Thanksgiving, and she wants to be included. She also asked to take part in our annual Secret Santa.

Am I an asshole for being weirded out by their relationship and not being very interested in getting to know her?

Don't get me wrong, she seems like a sweet lady. But just randomly writing inmates and falling in love with them??? Wanting to introduce your children to this inmate's family??? No one else in our fam has any criminal past/present, but she doesn't know that! A lot of guys run crazy game in prison and really play these women. My cousin happens to be one of the good ones, but man, something about her trusting him so much after only knowing him whilst he's in prison bothers me! Also, he's still got a DECADE behind bars. You're gonna write letters for 10 more years (BEST case scenario)?!

I haven't been mean, but I think she senses my vibe, which most of the family shares. I don't know, it just seems so weird to me. But then I feel like maybe I am a complete Grinch, not letting my cousin be happy?

He has said that he's been deeply touched by her, and that it's been a transforming experience to get to know someone new, who's able to see past his horrendous crime. He understands our reservations but hopes that we can ""find it in our hearts to try and understand this unusual situation"".

For the past two years, my wife's periods have been getting pretty irregular.  She says it's menopause.  I'm not a woman or a scientist, so I don't know, but ok, she says it's menopause.  Birth control for us has mostly been the rhythm method throughout our marriage and with her periods now random (sometimes 2-weeks, sometimes 6-weeks) and our low probability of pregnancy age, we are past the point of being really diligent about it.

Fast forward to 2020.  NYC lockdown and, well, a bit more sexy time was had than usual.  The novelty of us both working from home for the first time ever resulted in quite a few more special cuddles over a few period of a few weeks - lunchtimes and afternoons during a ""work from home"" day make the time pass quickly.  Fun time peaked around March/April...

Well - now she hasn't had a period since March and it's September.  That's right, not a single one.  They stopped completely since our few weeks of intensive fun in early Covid lockdown.  She thinks it's menopause finally arrived combined with a lot of work stress (she's a big wig HR manager for a major retailer).  She joked about it when she first notice she was really late (like 8-weeks) and I offered to go to the drug store to pick up, but she was like, no, it's just ""the change"".  For the record, there's a family history here - her youngest brother was born when her mom was 49.  He was not planned.

The only thing is... I think she's starting to show.  Well, sort of and I need to be careful here.  You see, my sweetie is no longer the slender gal she used to be.  She hasn't been for years.  She is still the most beautiful thing in the world to me, but she's somewhat plus-sized these days.  And pretty sensitive about it too.  Put it this way, accusing her of being pregnant if she isn't would be devastating to her - she really struggles with her weight and insecurities.

So - back to the question at hand.  I'd hate to destroy her self-esteem by pointing out just how nicely she fills out her yoga pants these days, but I'm also genuinely curious about the weight gain, the periods ending and the slim, but real chance of being a papa at age 53...

Should I demand she take a test, and would I be the asshole for doing that if she's just gained a few lbs due to not being able to do Zumba during a pandemic?",2020-09-22 15:31:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ixpnpl/aita_for_wanting_to_know_if_my_51year_old/,274,1049,0.97,1

930,NAH,AITA for refusing to give my engagement ring to late fiance's brother?,"I (27f) am really conflicted regarding my decision. 

Me and my late fiance (Alex) were together for about 12 years. We were high school sweethearts. We were engaged for around 3 years when he passed away due to an accident (in the beginning of 2020). 

I was really close with his family before everything happened. Once he died, spending time with them was only hurting me with ""what could have been"". I moved to the other side of the city to be closer to my new job and I still talk to them, but not as much as before. 

Few weeks ago, Alex's brother(Ben) came to visit me. He is planning to propose to his girlfriend. I was very happy him. He asked me if he could have the family's engagement ring. The ring Alex gave me was a family ring which had been in the family for generations. Alex's mom gave him the ring when he proposed to me as he was the eldest son. 

I have been wearing this ring for almost three years. It's a symbol that Alex wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. It represents our relationship to me. I conveyed the same. Ben lost his calm and he was telling at me about how it's his family ring and that it belongs to him now that Alex is dead. I told him to get out. 

I called Alex's mom to let her know why I wanted to keep the ring. She told me she wouldn't have minded if I had been married to Alex. But I wasn't, so I am not a part of the family and therefore I should return the ring. She also told me that since I am young, I am going to move on and that it's unfair to hold on to a ring that I will never wear again. Espcially a ring that belonged to her family for generations. It belongs to the family and not me or Alex, as Alex didn't buy it. 

I would have at least considered giving back the ring if few years had passed and I had moved on. I just can't bear the thought of parting with this ring now. 

So, I told her that I am sorry she felt that way but Alex gave me this ring and I am not giving it back and promptly hung up. 

Ben and his mom are spamming my phone with messages and calls about how I am trying to steal their family ring. They obviously think I am an asshole. 

Edit: At first it was just a matter of civil disagreement but as time goes it's getting more heated and lot more yelling and crying from both sides. 

So, AITA?

Edit: As I mentioned in the post, I am not saying that I will never return the ring. I am just saying I am not ready to return it now.

931,NAH,AITA for asking my messy eater GF to wear an apron at meals?,"My Gilfriend(25F) and I (25M) moved in to a small flat together about a year ago. We split chores and I do the laundry (I'm fine with that she does other stuff). The issue comes that shes a very messy eater and will spill something down her when eating pretty regularly. The amount of time I've spent scrubbing bolognese or curry sauce out of a white blouse and the amount of money spent on vanish and stain removers is mad (we dont have much money. She works minimum wage part time and I am on furlough/likely to lose my job). 

The other day when this happened I suggested she wear an apron when eating messy dinners. She got angry said shes not a child etc. and flatly refused. 

Im not suggesting she wears one with friends or when we are out but when it's a messy meal and it's just us. We have a couple of aprons we both use occasionally for cooking or baking or whatever, I'm just suggesting she uses one for eating certain meals.

932,NAH,AITA for not renting my house for a cheaper price to my son?,"I (60F) have only one son (30M), who lives with me. I own two apartments, the one where we live in along with my father's, which was bought in my name, even though he would be the one living there. My father passed away, but thankfully from old age and not from the current pandemic. I always said I didn't want to move into the apartment he lived in (despite being the same size, mine has bigger balconies), so I guess my son always assumed he would be moving in to the other one once his grandfather passed away.

He brought that subject to me a few weeks after the event. He’s been dating his partner for 8 years and they’ve never been able to afford a place, since rent is outrageously expensive where we live in, and buying a house is almost impossible in our country with their salaries. He wants to move in with her to my father's house, and he said it'd only be fair if they paid. They would be paying around 700€ of rent, which is a little over half their conjoined income.

However, I showed the house to a friend of mine who is a realtor, and she said that the house could easily rent for over 1500€ and she could get someone to live there ASAP. I am already going to have a comfortable life when I retire, but that amount would basically double my income and I could live a life of luxury.

My son wasn't happy when I told him I was planning on taking my friend's suggestion and renting the house at that price. He says that 1500€ is more than what he and his partner make together as a couple, and they can’t afford it. He feels it’s unfair that I’d rather get a profit than allow him and his partner to start a new chapter in their lives and become a family. I told him that he’s still going to be allowed to live with me, so he can’t really complain and the house is mine so I can do whatever I want with it. He got visibly upset and said he would never be allowed to move onward since the economy is basically ruined by greedy people like me who want to make easy money from renting.

933,NAH,AITA Spouse doesn’t like tattoo areas,"
So, I currently have two sleeves and I’m working on my whole back and torso tattooed. When I met my wife I was a tattoo virgin, and she’s been okay with my tattoo journey so far. I was talking to her about when the Airforce allows us to tattoo our hands  I wanted to get a small rose tattoo on the inside of my thumb/palm area for our Daughter. Then she told me she draws the line at hand and neck tattoos, this lead to a huge argument because I already have my neck/hands planned out. The argument ended with her walking out of the house when I told her “it’s my body and I’ll do what I want to it”. I might be the asshole because in a marriage you have to make sacrifices to keep things kosher. However I have never told her she couldn’t dress, act, change hair colors or get piercings, because it’s her body and I want her to be able to express herself. AITA?

934,NAH,AITA for not being excited to get a car,"So I just turned 16 and I've been dreading this for a while. As I got older I started thinking about driving and honestly it terrifies me, I do not trust myself in control of an at least thousand pound metal death vehicle. I've made this very clear every time my parents asked about driving and that's come up a lot.

My 16th comes around and I'm just chilling on the couch playing video games just trying to lay low, nothing serious when my parents told me to get up and come outside. Naturally I did and as we got to the door my dad handed me a key, this is when my heart sank. We obviously get outside and they show me the new car and such but when I reacted I just kinda said thanks, there was no hugging or loud noises and my parents definitely seem to think I should've had a bigger reaction.

So I say I think it’s kind of a dick move and a little cruel, like it’s sort of like tripping someone and laughing at them. I don’t really feel that strongly about it but I don’t think it’s a great approach to parenting. She said point-blank “it’s just a lemon” and went on to say how I was analyzing her and trying to make everything perfect and thinking too much and on and on and on.

936,NAH,AITA for not wanting to adopt child from my wife’s dysfunctional family?,"AITA for not wanting to adopt child from my wife’s dysfunctional family?

I’m in my early 30’s and my wife is in her late 20’s. We’ve been married for a few years and both work full-time with average paying jobs. We have 2 kids of our own already, both under the age of 3. We own our own home but money has been tight with my wife being out of work for months due to Covid. She’s just about to start a new job, however work in her industry is never very stable. 

My wife’s family lives a few states away, and she essentially moved here after finishing college for a job, and to escape their bullshit. Her family is extremely dysfunctional and filled with alcoholics, drug addicts, and complete degenerates. She is the only one that has graduated college and actually made something out of her life. 

My wife’s cousin had a child at the age of 17, and insisted on keeping him, despite everyone telling her that she shouldn’t. Shortly after the kid was born, she took off and left the kid with my wife’s grandmother who is in her 80’s with a myriad of health issues and my wife’s uncle who lives on disability and can hardly take care of himself. There is no indication the mother will ever get her shit together, and no one knows where the father is. 

The kid is around 2 years old now. My wife brought up the idea of adopting him a few weeks ago after learning about her grandmothers’ failing health and her uncle’s inability to pick up the slack. She’s concerned that the child will be destined to a life of misery, abuse, and neglect if he has to stay in his current situation, which I mostly agree with. She also is convinced that the foster care system is no better for the kid. As much as the situation completely and totally sucks, I don’t think it’s possible that we could take on a third child for so many reasons. We’ve had a few arguments about it and I always come away feeling like a monster for not wanting to adopt him.

937,NAH,AITA for being upset that our baby was a girl when we were told otherwise?,"When my wife was pregnant, I didn't give a shit whether it was a boy or a girl. We found out the baby was a boy halfway through at the anatomy scan, and I was excited as all hell. I bonded with that little man inside her belly. We were going to call him Gideon, and I talked to him every day, read stories to him, told him all about the adventures we would have once he was here. We did the nursery up, got a ton of clothes, the works.

Well, when my wife presented in labor they did another ultrasound to confirm the baby was head-down, and nobody mentioned anything about the sex even though we were talking to the doctor and the resident saying it was a boy and he has a male cousin three months older so it's perfect, etc.

Labor time comes, my wife is pushing, and suddenly there's a head of hair and screaming, and I'm overwhelmed with emotion until I see that the baby is not, in fact, a boy. My wife cuddles her close but I was just shocked. I was ready to meet Gideon and now this wasn't Gideon. I felt like I hadn't gotten a chance to bond with this new random girl, unlike my wife who carried her for nine months. I stayed for a minute to make sure my wife and baby were both stable, and then I left the room and cried a bit. I was gone for probably ten minutes. However, in this time I missed the cord clamping which apparently happened right after I said I'm leaving the room to get some air. I didn't know this. Nobody told me.

*Now* I am totally in love with our baby (like I said, I never cared about the sex although if pushed I would lean towards preferring a boy and my wife leaned girl). After I had time to process and realize the obvious conclusion that the baby I read to and sang to was still my baby even if it wasn't the baby I pictured in my head, I loved her more than I thought possible. This took all of ten minutes to clear my head. However, my wife has still not forgiven me for not being there for *ten minutes*, which was *after* she had given birth and while was smiling dopily at the baby, in no pain or distress. She's mad that I missed the cord clamping but I don't even think it's that big of a deal. She thinks it's unforgivable that I didn't love the baby the second she came out just because she was a girl.

I left because I knew my emotions were fucked and I didn't want to make any part of the labor a negative experience for her by saying anything slightly negative. Well apparently by leaving I ruined the birth so I lose both ways.

AITA?

Edit: it literally was nearly two minutes before the cord was clamped, I stayed there for a good minute of baby just cuddling up to my wife and made sure both of them were fine before I left. Also, I would have had the same reaction if they told us it was a girl and then it turned out to be a boy. Stop projecting sexism onto everything.

938,NAH,WIBTA if I continued my baking hobby despite my brother’s request?,"Due to quarantine, I have stayed home for college with the rest of my siblings, and I’ve recently started to bake again as a hobby to keep myself occupied and to burn off some steam. I recently got all stocked up for the fall baking season with just about every silly fall ingredient you can imagine. Caramel apples, toasted pumpkin seeds, all that jazz.

My brother, however, came up to me after breakfast and asked me if I could bake less because he’s trying to get healthy and lose a bit of weight. I completely understand the idea of reducing temptation— I’ve been on and off diets myself recently, quarantine weight is no joke— and I think it’s great that he’s been trying to take care of himself, he needs it! I’d do anything to help him feel better about himself, for the most part.

The problem is, this is my hobby. It’s often my means of winding down after classes, and I don’t want to waste my fresh ingredients. I don’t want to make my brother’s life harder, but he gets to indulge in his video game hobby all the time and I really enjoy baking once or twice a week. I know it’s causing everyone to gain a bit of weight and I feel guilty about that, but I don’t know what else to do. 

So, would I be the asshole if I kept up baking at the rate I usually do even though my brother asked for me to do otherwise?

 I'm big on gift giving, while he is mostly a physical touch kind of person. Normally this wouldn't be a problem but I have ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) and generally dont really liked to be touched.

It's not like I don't let him touch me at all, I actually let him touch more than most people in my life but I ask him to give me a verbal warning before he touches me like ""hey I'm going to give you a hug now"", or ""hey I'm going to kiss you now"" etc. 

It was fine for the most part at the start of the relationship but now as time goes on he seems to forget more and more and it makes me really uncomfortable, like I tense up sometimes when he touches me.

He seemed really upset about this and the mood was kind of sour for the rest of the night. I wanted to talk about it but I'm not really good at initiating hard conversations like that and was expecting him to speak up about it but be didn't and just went home early.

Since 2009, Mia and I have mostly talked on the phone and exchanged gifts to maintain our friendship. Our most recent phone calls have felt incredibly one-sided to me, and I'm now weighing if it's worth continuing this friendship.

Mia, a middle school teacher, is now a SAHM who is five months pregnant with her second son while homeschooling her 7-year-old. Her entire life is pregnancy, childcare, crafting and domesticity. 

My life, on the other hand, is happily child-free and is focused on educating myself for a career shift post-pandemic. I live in a large metropolitan area with many libraries, parks and many cultural events, but Mia is nearly an hour from anything and rarely engages in any activities.

Whenever we catch up, I'm the one who usually calls. Mia, however, speaks at length about her life for up to 95% of the conversation. I have no issue being a supportive friend, but I would like the exchange to be equitable. Frankly, a lot about her life bores me.

943,NAH,AITA for wanting to go to the same college my twin brother wants to go to?,"
My (17F) twin brother (17M) and i have always been close, or so i thought. To be honest I don’t think i can recall a time we spent any amount of days apart. We even shared a room until we were 12. I love my twin, he’s super funny and confident and I’m pretty much the exact opposite. Most of our friends are friends he introduced me to. 

Recently however he’s been kind of withdrawing from me and our friend group. He says he doesn’t want to always be doing the same things. But it’s not like we do EVERYTHING together. We hang out a lot sure but its not every single waking second.

We were talking about where we want to go to college earlier and i said i wanted to go to a school thats nearby so I don’t have to pay for dorms and risk getting a random stranger for a roommate. I assumed he would say the same, but he said he wanted to go to school out of state. He says he wants to get outside experience on his own. The school he wants to go to would literally be across the country. We talked in great detail and if im being real it makes a lot of sense. I started thinking maybe i should do the same. We obviously wouldn’t be sharing a dorm or classes, but i also can’t imagine being thousands of miles away from my twin.

I told him i would look into the school as well and i may apply there next year. He really didn’t like that and he yelled at me. He told me he doesn’t want me there and to go somewhere else before he stormed into his room. I was kind of blindsided by his reaction and i have no idea where this is all coming from. Neither of us have even started putting out apps so am i the asshole for wanting to go to the same school as my twin? I’ve been crying about his response to me and i feel like im losing a part of myself. Please tell me im not crazy...

I hate my brother. I loathe him. The day his heart stops is the day the world is a little lighter. He’s an awful, garbage, disgusting human being who deserves no happiness. He exists solely to use and inflict pain on others. 


Unfortunately, as the case of most idiots who have no business procreating, he made a child. I made it very clear to my parents that I wanted NOTHING to do with my brother, and if they even spoke his name around me I would leave and not speak to them for awhile. They can’t get it through their thick skulls. My mother still thinks we should “be a faaaaaamily” and try to forgive, even if I don’t forget I should at least acknowledge him as a loved one. He isn’t loved, so no. 


6-7 years ago my mother mentioned his girlfriend was pregnant in a way she didn’t say his name so it “didn’t count” cuz it wasn’t about “him”. I told her I was sorry for that child and hope the mother wises up and runs away with it. She told me I was awful to wish the child without a dad. I disagree.


His daughter was born and my mother sent me pictures. I cried. Such a beautiful little girl born with such awful circumstances. It wasn’t fair to her. But I couldn’t be a part of her life. I demanded my mother stop, he was an extension of her and I didn’t need the reminder in my life. The most I did was reach out to the mother through Facebook anonymously that I hope she sees clearly and gets her daughter away safely before it’s too late. I wanted to extend myself as a safe place but we were a country apart and, honestly, I would never risk a branch reaching to him as I know most victims return to the abuser several times.


Baby’s Mom has full custody. My mother now thinks this means I should have a relationship with mom and baby since it’s been years. 
No. I can’t. I don’t want to. It hurts. 
I’m also 90% sure this is not his only child out there, just the first to nail him for paternity. I can’t start a precedent of seeing every one of his children as family. 


My family will bring baby up and when I don’t engage or change the subject because it hurts hearing about her I’m told I’m heartless and cold. I’ve even been told, “you think you’re better than your brother, but here you are denying a child from some sense of self-righteousness. You’re delusional if you think you’re a good person.” 


I’ve been reminded of her recently and once again I shut the topic down. I’ve been told I’m awful and cruel and ill regret my choices eventually. Sometimes I see their side and feel overwhelmed with guilt and think I’m a giant asshole. The child is innocent, but even if he wasn’t involved I don’t want to be.

945,NAH,WIBTA if I refuse to give my address to somebody who wants to send me a gift?,"This is on my daughter’s behalf. She has asked for my help so I would like to get some different perspectives to consider. 

My daughter E is 21. Her Aunt C sent her a text asking what type of gift card she would like for Christmas. My daughter no longer wishes to receive gifts from her Aunts and Uncles. She feels that she is now independent enough to buy the things that she needs for herself. These people don’t talk to her all year or know much about her life. Only what gets passed on through  the grandparents. So E feels that informing somebody where she likes to shop so that she can receive an impersonal piece of plastic is kind of dumb. I wholeheartedly agree and could add so much more but let’s get to it. 

E sent a text expressing thankfulness for the offer. She explained that she had been grateful for all gifts received in the past. She said that as an adult she no longer felt it necessary for them to spend their money on her and that holiday wishes were plenty. The response was a request for her address.  E suggested that they make a donation to charity on her behalf. Nope, you’re getting a gift. She went on to explain that receiving what amounts to money from them while so many other humans are in need would in fact make her feel bad, and that Isn’t supposed to be the intent of a gift. She went on to acknowledge that C would feel good by the act of giving the gift, but that in this case, E felt that her discomfort with receiving the gift would outweigh C’s gratification from giving. Therefore, C is putting her wants over E’s needs. 

These very well thought out responses only elicited more requests for the address. So, WIBTA for refusing to give the address?",2020-11-21 00:01:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jy0kpp/wibta_if_i_refuse_to_give_my_address_to_somebody/,38,14,0.9,0
946,NAH,"AITA. Am I The Asshole? My Mom Goes Through My texts Without permission, And I would like to have privacy.","Im genuinely curious if im in the right here or if this is one of those things where the child just doesn't understand yet.

so recently my mom has been going through my text messages which I dont like. for instance I was getting a checkup because I broke my arm recently and they were x raying it to see how much better it has gotten. my mom wasn't allowed in the room  so she stayed outside with my phone. I kept my bluetooth head phones on and while they x rayed my arm I heard tapping from my headphones. I knew she was going through my phone and I was slightly annoyed and when I came out of the room I confronted her about it. she said that she was just checking my texts, I told her I didn't like that she was invading my privacy but she just said that she paid for the phone so she got to go through it. I thought that was BS and that I can have some kind of privacy. I know she wants to make sure im safe but im 13 so its not like im doing drugs and stuff lol. in theory what I came out to a few of my friends as gay, or if one of my friends came out to me as gay but didn't want anyone els to know, and then my mom looked and told everyone. I think there are some things that are not terrible that I am allowed to keep private. I know she has good intentions but I am allowed to have some privacy right? idk. I have to delete messages that I wanna keep private and It is really frustrating. at least she could ask to go through them first and not try and do it behind my back without me knowing.

I Think Im the asshole because I know she means the best and this could just be something im to young to understand

parents if you read this I want you to tell me you opinions and I want to know if this is ok or not.

also dont take this the wrong way and think mom is horrible, she is a great mother and we have a great relationship and I truly think I couldn't have had a better mother. sometimes I just doubt the things she does

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit: wow I really appreciate the advice and I understand both sides. on one hand I deserve to have a little privacy and be able to chat with my friends without worrying about my mom, on the other it is good for her to monitor my safety and make sure im doing ok and she has every right to.

I think I am going to ask her respectfully that she should at least tell me she will be looking at my messages so I can be aware of when she is looking.

also it is not that I tell my friends horrible things that would make my mother worry about my health, its just sometimes I like to vent to my friends over text about things I dont feel comfortable of my mother seeing.

have a nice day :)

note: also my phone is heavily monitored so I cant get texts or calls from people who are not on my contacts and stuff so no need to worry about scams and creepy people and all of that lol.",2020-11-19 16:36:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jx5zk4/aita_am_i_the_asshole_my_mom_goes_through_my/,50,9,0.86,0
947,NAH,WIBTA if I tell my daughter's friend that I'm uncomfortable with the way she sees me?,"This has been going on for a year now. It started last year when my daughter invited some of her friends over to our house to use the pool. I was downstairs watching a game, and she came in and asked if she could get something from the fridge. I said sure and just to make polite conversation, I asked, ""How's school?

I thought she would've said, ""Good"" and kept it moving, but she started blinking back tears and telling me how hard it was to stay focused on school and studying and sports while her parents were going through a nasty divorce.

Now, mind you. This was my first time meeting her.  I don't remember my words exactly, I just remember reassuring her things were going to be okay, and that just because her parents were going through what they were going through, it didn't mean they didn't love her and she should just focus on being the best that she could be and not worrying about blaming herself or trying to live up to anybody's expectations (basically, what I tell my daughter). 

And I told her it was okay to cry it out, and I told her where the bathroom was and told her to take as long as she needed. Then I went back to watching my game. After she was done, came out, thanked me for listening her and saying that my words had made her feel much better, and then she went back out to the pool.

Done, right? Wrong. It escalated. Not as far as any more crying, but this girl is acting like I'm her father. She shows me her report cards, she tells me how her day is going, she bought me a Happy Father's Day coffee mug. I didn't know my wish list on Amazon was public until she bought me items from them on my birthday and on Christmas. She introduced me to one of her boyfriends, and I told my daughter later that I didn't really like the boy, and my daughter went and told the girl the next day, and she immediately broke up with him.

I'm not the only one who notices this behavior and the girl is not even hiding it. My daughter thinks it's funny and keeps joking about me adopting her so they can be sisters. My wife thinks it's cute and says that I can be a positive influence.

I know it's all pretty harmless (right?) but I'm just uncomfortable with it. I don't know what's going on in her home life, obviously she's not close to her biological dad and my daughter says she never even talks about him. But I just don't feel - is qualified the right word? - enough to fill that role. I was wondering if it would be okay to tell her to find somebody else?

948,NAH,AITA for not wanting to lose weight?,"Hi friends. I’m a sixteen year old female and I weigh more than what’s average for my age. I have always been a chubby girl and I gained quarantine weight. My parents really want me to lose weight. Specifically my mother. I went into her room to ask to borrow a pair of boots and she started talking about I’m really unhealthy and my weight is really unhealthy and I need to lose weight. And I wouldn’t mind losing weight; I just dont want to do it as fast as my mother wants me to. I don’t want to cut out carbs, sweets or treats. I also don’t want to eat foods I don’t like. The reason I don’t want to lose weight as fast as my mother wants me to is because I like my body now. I used to hate my body so much that I would cry over it and now i like and I’ve accepted that yes this is my body. 

I know that this comes out of a place of love but it feels as though my parents are so stuck on me losing weight or what I’m eating that they don’t see me. It feels as if they don’t know me

949,NAH,AITA for “abandoning” my sister by choosing to stay with my dad and by extension my doctors when our parents divorced?,"My (16f) parents recently finalized their divorce. During it, my sister (14f) and I were asked who we wanted to live with. I chose dad, my sister chose mom. My sister is pissed/sad (I don’t event know anymore) with me for “abandoning” her and mom.

Dad decided to stay here, but mom got a job somewhere else and decided to move.

I chose dad because he’s an effing amazing dad and also because of my current doctors. 

I have a genetic blood disorder. I’ve been getting regular blood transfusions since I was less than a year old. Currently I need them once every 3 weeks or so, most likely for the rest of my life. Also chelation therapy. Not. Fun. 

This disorder is not common at all in my country, and my parents moved constantly when I was a kid trying to find good doctors. The amount of bullshit, and frankly scary experiences I’ve had with other doctors and hospitals before my parents settled on this one is enormous. 

If I went with my mom, I’d have to move schools and find new doctors which I really don’t want to do. My sister didn’t inherit it and is healthy, so she doesn’t really get why it’s such a big deal for me. She’s under the “all doctors are the same” impression, which is ok since she’s only 14. 

But she’s been going back and forth between giving me the cold shoulder and calling me crying that I “picked some stupid doctors over her” and that mom’s at work all the time and she’s lonely. I genuinely do feel like an insensitive butt because she’s so sad, but at the same time I really don’t want to leave as well.",2020-10-26 20:45:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jimvdu/aita_for_abandoning_my_sister_by_choosing_to_stay/,42,362,0.97,0
950,NAH,AITA for misplacing my partner's things?,"My partner (29m) and I (26f) live together in a house we just moved into a few months ago. We're remodeling some parts of the house by hand and are  having a hard time finding the right furniture, so the whole house is a little sparse. Non essential things are still stored in boxes, etc. 

My partner has ADHD and has always been on the messy side, whereas I am neater than the average person and hate a messy house. Being in an unfinished space has exacerbated his issues with tidying up, and I frequently find things laying around out of place. I do the bulk of the cleaning because mess bothers me more, and when I'm deep cleaning I tend to put miscellaneous clutter away in places I think are appropriate. Sometimes my idea of appropriate doesn't match my partner's.

This dynamic has started to become a reoccurring spat, where I clean up a big pile of clutter, inevitably misplace something, and my partner gets frustrated because he sees that as me losing his things. I've tried to compromise; I placed little dishes to collect loose change and small items, I built in floating shelves with key hooks, and I implemented a basket system to put things that I can't find a place for, so that he can review and put them away on his own. The problem is that the clutter piles still accumulate in places like the middle of the dining room table and on the floor. 

I'm tired of having this conversation so I told my partner that if he wants to keep his stuff from getting ""lost"", he just has to put it away properly before I get to it. I'm at a loss on how else to resolve the issue besides just not cleaning, which would make me miserable. He thinks I'm being the AH because I can't leave things untouched.

952,NAH,AITA for telling my boyfriend to quit his job?,"My (F21) boyfriend, Oscar (M21) has recently got a job in a managers position for a very popular fast food restaurant. He was so excited for it as its his first managers position, but from the start there have been issues. He's in a managers position but the staff don't listen to him, and the other managers treat him like he's a lower position than them. He's being picked on, verbally abused and he comes home upset almost every day. They also haven't been paying him properly; he was promised £9.30 p/h but he has only been receiving £8.20 p/h (minimum wage). He's getting paid less hours than what he works, and he's being emergency taxed even though he's given them his P45. Luckily he has other income, otherwise he would not be able to afford rent.
He brought up the pay issues with the store manager, and was told he was not allowed to contact her outside of her work hours. He then spoke to her on shift and she said his pay had been sorted... it hadn't. She also said it was his fault he was being emergency taxed. He never received a copy of his contract, he has since asked for it twice with no response. His manager claims that it doesn't say how much p/h he's meant to earn in the contract, but he knows it does.
I've told him over and over to leave the job, I believe from the managers responses to his problems, these issues won't be solved and he will continue to work a stressful job at minimum wage. He can afford to pay rent without this job, and I'm worried about his mental health. He doesn't want to quit because he has a history of not being able to hold down a job, but I genuinely believe that this is not his fault. I have suggested a trade union to him but he hasn't seemed interested.
I feel kind of bad about pressuring him to quit, so I want some advice and I was wondering AITA for telling my boyfriend to quit his job?

UPDATE: Oscar has just called me, he has spoken to someone at the same position as him, Charlotte, who has looked on the computer and has found no files on Oscar except for the LAST page of his contract with nothing but his signature on it. He also believes that the printed name on there is not his handwriting. So the company has no record of his contract, P45 or even his ID, whereas others who started around the same time as him have their records on the computer. 
He has also discovered that he hasn't been paid for 2 weeks online training that he did, even though Ella (store manager) said he would be. Charlotte has also told him that training is meant to be paid at £8.60 p/h which was NOT stated in his contract, he hasn't been paid for his training anyway and he has been receiving only £8.20 p/h which is less than the associates are getting.",2020-11-14 13:50:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ju27qg/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_to_quit_his_job/,29,65,0.89,0

I am (was?) a groomsman. Back in October, I dropped out of attending the bachelor party, due to rising covid concerns and my declining mental health. I had confided in him that my anxiety was overwhelming and I thought it would be best to sit this out for all involved, but that I was still looking forward to attending the wedding. 

I had every intention of going to the wedding. Groomsman suit was bought. Hotel was booked. 

Then, out of the blue, I received a text message from him, not asking about how I am doing, but saying that he knows I’ve been uncomfortable with covid and knows how much anxiety it causes, so “no hard feelings if you want to drop out of attending the wedding entirely.” Also, if I’m cool with going to the wedding, my girlfriend (who he’s known longer than his soon to be wife), is DEFINITELY uninvited because of state restrictions on number of guests. 

It felt like he was using my struggles as his scapegoat to cut me out of his wedding, whether it be retribution for not attending the bachelor party or otherwise.

954,NAH,AITA for betting that my sister in law would beat my wife in wrestling,"So, this whole thing blew up between me and my wife, and I really don't get what the big fuss is about. 

So, in my family, we always have arm-wrestling competitions, generally the women arm-wrestle much more, for whatever reason. My aunt was a family legend, easily dominating everybody ( my mum was beaten by her so much) So, we had a family gathering a while ago, and of course, the arm-wrestling began. 

Now, about my wife, she is insanely competitive and fit, and a high school athlete, in both volleyball and boxing. She is someone who hates losing, and hates having losing in front of or to her loved ones, so in hindsight, I probably should have seen this coming. 

About my SIL, she is just as fit as my wife, and also quite competitive, and a high school boxer as well. 

So, my wife and SIL went around arm-wrestling everybody, and beating all the women they faced. Now, a key match was my wife going up against my cousin. My wife did beat my cousin, but it took some effort out of her, while my SIL beat her much faster and with less effort. 

So when the time came for the inevitable match between my wife and SIL, everybody joked around saying they'd find out who the ""Alpha Female"" is, placing small bets on who would win. Once again, this isn't a serious amount, just a couple pounds. I placed a bet on my SIL beating my wife, and everybody laughed, while my wife silently glared at me. I could tell that she was annoyed by this, but didn't think much of it, she'd either win, and be happy, or lose and we'd make some money off of it. 

The match happened, and it was kinda close, but kinda not, and in the end, my wife lost. Everybody cheered my SIL, who bowed and told my wife ""guess we know who's the Alpha Female"". My brother looked really smug about it, and jokingly told me ""my wife's stronger than your wife""

My wife looked really disheartened, but figured she'd get over it in a couple minutes, but after a while, she asked if we could leave. We left and on our way home, she started tearing up a bit, talking about how humiliated she was, and how even I thought she couldn't beat SIL. I tried to cheer her up, but she kept on bringing up how I bet against her, and how humiliating everybody's comments were.

955,NAH,AITA for flat out refusing to go to my best friends of 20 years' baby shower and telling her I want to distance myself now she's becoming a mom?,"My best friend and I have been best friends for over 20 years now. We're both only 22, but our moms went to school together and introduced us as babies. We've been best friends ever since. I absolutely love her, she's more of a sister than my best friend. 

About 8 months ago now, she told me she was pregnant. I was over the moon for her. Her and her boyfriend have been wanting children for years, but the announcement came at a bad time. About a week beforehand, I suffered a third trimester miscarriage, and despite being only 22, this is the fourth child I have lost. I became pregnant at 18 and had a stillbirth. About a year later, I got pregnant again and gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. Due to infant sleep apnea, my daughter passed away in her sleep when she was four months old. My husband and I made all the efforts we could to revive her but it was too late by the time we had found her. Six months later, I found out I was pregnant again, but suffered a miscarriage at 11 weeks, and then soon after got pregnant again. At 30 weeks, we discovered our baby had no heartbeat and I had a stillbirth. 

My best friend has been my absolute rock over the past few years and I truly would not have got through the last few years without her support. I'm ecstatic that she's pregnant, I really am, but I physically will not be able to handle the baby shower, nor will I be able to spend time with my best friend and her baby without feeling some kind of resentment towards her, which I would obviously rather avoid and just leave our friendship civil where it is.

My best friend seemed understanding when I opened up with her, but ever since she has gone out of her way to make me feel horrendous about the situation. Whether it be very blatant indirects on social media, texts trying to guilt me from her, her husband and our mutual friends, everything. 

I received a text a few days ago from a mutual friend of ours. The conversation started off nice until she started telling me how selfish I was for not putting my own feelings aside to be there for my best friend. I told her that they weren't feelings I could put aside and that my best friend understood that. She then sent me screenshots from a group chat with my best friend calling me just about every name under the sun and giving girls I didn't even know very intimate details of each loss I have suffered. 

I reached out to my best friend and it led to an intense argument, with her saying she wouldn't want someone as miserable as me being around her child anyway. I called her, genuinely thinking it was some kind of prank, but it wasn't and she told me that she felt extremely betrayed at the fact I couldn't just ""get over it for one day"" to attend the baby shower.

She has a son who is around my fathers age and at this point I talk to him more than my own father. I have always been very kind to Stacey, talking with her, reaching out and just basically treating her like a 3rd grandmother. Recently, Stacey has started to hand me money as a gift for being kind to her all these years. In her words ""Her own grandchildren dont call her and im the only one from the kids in my family that calls her"". Apparently, she normally would give her granddaughters the same gift but they don't come around anymore. At first I was very appreciative of the money and made it clear to her that I do not expect it. It has now continued to happen and she doesn't want me to let anyone know about it for jealousy and other reasons. It has started to make me uncomfortable as I have a hard enough time accepting birthday and christmas gifts let alone a gift for just being nice to someone. I would like to ask her to stop giving these gifts to me as they kind of make me uncomfortable and I don't feel like its right to take her money. she has made it clear that she is doing it because she is appreciative, it just makes me a little uncomfortable. I don't want to be a dick and reject her generosity but its getting a little too much. WIBTA if I asked her to stop giving me these gifts?

I was diagnosed with depression a year ago, and since then my life has been full of ups and downs. My husband tried to support me even though he didn't understand the right to mental disorders. He works and supports them both while I only study (I'm in college).

&#x200B;

Recently I've been feeling worse and worse and I'm not in the mood to do much. My husband and I shared some tasks, but now I haven't cooked and I can barely muster the willpower to clean something. Even the simplest task wears me out very quickly and at the end of the day I always feel very tired, both physically and mentally. Despite this, I try my best to keep the house in order (my sister has come to my house to help).

&#x200B;

Last night he came home from work and I hadn’t cooked dinner again or washed the dishes (I was busy with college stuff and my online consultation with my psychologist) and he was very upset about it. He complained that he was tired of asking for delivery and that it was a waste of money, since I could cook very well. I argued that I was busy and that I hadn't been feeling well all day.

&#x200B;

We started fighting and he said, among other things, that the least I should do was cook and try to keep the house in order, since he supported the house and that I should stop using depression as an excuse to be lazy . I was very upset and went to spend the night at my sister's house (she lives relatively close to me). He tried to call me, but I didn't feel like arguing at the time. Now I'm feeling really bad. I know it works and I don't and that I could do more. I don't know how to fix this. My sister says that he was a complete asshole and that he should apologize on his knees.

So this isn’t really a big deal, but I’m curious as to the verdict.  My husband won’t let me play his video games at all now. I don’t want to do boss fights or anything, or any fights if I can help it. Usually I happily watch him play, but sometimes I want to do things myself. 

I mostly want to wander around, wade at the beach, look at sunsets, and pick flowers. He used to let me play, but I messed up a couple times. Once, he let me play with his dune buggy, and I drove it into the ocean by mistake. (Online, obviously, in GTA. )  As God is my witness, I thought dune buggies could go into water! Unfortunately I destroyed it. Then one time he let me drive a little remote controlled car when the mission was to blow other random cars up. Unfortunately, I accidentally blew up our own van, killing his character. It was an honest mistake. I had no idea what vehicle we were in. Each time he tried to yell “no!” but too late. 

So now he won’t let me play. While I realize I screwed up a couple times, I have also helped him frequently. One time he had to play some music on a piano to solve a riddle, but he had no idea how to read music OR play a piano. He was super frustrated, but I had several years of piano lessons. So I pointed out which keys to play to solve the puzzle, while he controlled the game to play the piano. I have helped him solve other riddles directly back when he let me play occasionally but now he just asks for advice and for me to occasionally google things but won’t let me play. 

It’s not a big deal but which one is the AH? ;) Should he let me play for fun, once in a while, even if it may occasionally result in character death and/or online properly damage? (Especially since I often help solve riddles.) Or should I stop asking cause I know I have lousy hand eye coordination and have goofed up occasionally?

(If it matters all our money is pooled, but the game consoles were most likely gifts to him half from me, half from my parents. And he isn’t addicted to gaming AFAIK.)

Thanks!

ETA: I don’t really want to play the entire game myself from start to finish. I am really not good at video games! I just want to well, sight-see and have a bit of fun. I am good at solving riddles or puzzles but not good at combat or anything involving skill or reflexes. Also if I tried to play the whole game I would be taking away my husband’s video game time/tv. It’s in our living room, but is the biggest tv and all the game systems are hooked up there.",2020-11-26 21:12:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k1ni98/aita_for_wanting_to_play_my_husbands_video_games/,27,10,0.91,0
959,NAH,AITA for asking my(36M) wife (38F) to please shut up about my imminent death?,"Me and my wife have been in a loving marriage for 6 years and together for 10. We have an amazing 3 year old girl together. I don’t want to get too much into it but I’m not long for this earth if you catch my drift. I have about 8 months before I shed this earthly form. Don’t fucking start with the “I’m so sorry” stuff, that’s cool in all but I don’t like being treated or looked at like I’m going to die. In fact I don’t even really like talking about it.

We’ve already handled my affairs, my wife knows what I want, cremation and a new daddy for my daughter. My life insurance will take great care of them, and I’ve come to peace with my death. My wife on the other hand is understandably a mess. I don’t blame her, but sometimes I think it’s annoying. We’ve been spending as much time as possible together as a family which I really enjoy, but it’s incredibly difficult to enjoy my last months on this world when my wife becomes inconsolable. 

I do my best to comfort, her I really do, but it’s hard to assure someone that everything will be fine after your own death. Honestly it makes my time with her more depressing. I don’t want her to have to think about it as much, I want her last months with me to feel like the best months of her life. When I’m gone I want her to think about the great places we’re going, the amazing love we’re making, the fantastic foods I’m cooking for her, only the good things, she can’t do that if every time I get close to her she starts crying. 

Last week, we were cuddling in bed and I asked her to be big spoon. I turned around and she got on my back. I could hear her smelling my hair. She then started quietly crying. I asked her what was wrong, she said she was going to miss the way I smelled. I turn I sat up with her so she could cry on my shoulder.  After she stopped I brought up my displeasure. My exact words were, “I know you’re hurting and I want you to feel better and take care of you as much as possible. But right now, I need to to shut up about my death. It’s not doing any of us any good to talk about or think about my death.”

She was shocked, she told me that she’s never seen me be such an uncaring asshole. I apologized profusely, and told her that I Just want to stop talking about it and thinking about it. I talked to my sister and she said I’m the biggest asshole she’s ever met.

960,NAH,AITA - Who's Leaving?,"A year ago I got a 2 bedroom/2 bathroom apartment and a couple months into my lease I decided to get a roommate. I committed to a year with the roommate and then we would evaluate how things are going. After a year, I decided I want to live in the apartment by myself again.

When my roommate moved in, she moved into a fully furnished house and pretty much did not have to bring anything. We use my kitchen table, she sleeps on the bed I bought for the second bedroom, my coffee pot, my dishes (mostly), I had a couch that we used but then we moved it to the porch and went half and half on another couch. We use my TV, my roku, my entertainment center, my coffee table - you get the gist.

My complex requires anyone over the age of 18 who is living in the apartment to be on the lease. So when she came she signed up on the lease instead of it being my name with her as a roommate. Now my roommate is telling me she shouldn't have to be the one that has to move out since she's on the lease and it's not her choice to move. She thinks that I should have to be the one to move out. My perspective is I told her this would be on a year by year basis, I was here first, I allowed her into my home, and the house is 97% full of my things.

Who's the jerk in this situation?",2020-11-24 15:25:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k06zhe/aita_whos_leaving/,30,10,0.92,0
961,NAH,WIBTA for telling my mum I have no interest in staying in her house because of my brothers family?,"Background: earlier this year I had to come home because I lost my job and apartment. At the beginning I was supposed to stay in my parents second home (inherited from my great grandparents.) but my sisters family moved in there, and I got moved into my parents main home. It was fine until a month later my brother and his wife moved in because she was having a baby and needed the support. They were supposed to move back to their property but my dad convinced them that that land was a bad investment and to sell their portion out and move in until they can get a place in town.
Situation: My main plan had been to move back to the city I had been living in, but I can’t take it here anymore. My niece (8yeare old) is a brat, and my nephew (7 months old) is a typical baby. I finally decided that I’m just going to get a job here and get a cheap apartment until I can save enough to get back to where I want to be, I need to make sure I have minimum three months rent. The problem is my mom is asking why I’m making this choice when technically she’s right when she says it would be easier to save the money if I stayed here. It sounds really messed up but I can’t stand kids for long periods, they are so awful and loud not to mention 7 people in a three bedroom is sending my anxiety off the charts. I’m usually a very clean person and having an orderly environment is extremely important to me, but I can’t keep the house clean if I don’t scrub it down every night. 
I hate lying to her but I’m afraid she’ll be really upset that I don’t feel comfortable in her house. So would I be the asshole for telling my mom I want to move? Should I lie? Or should I just suck it up and stay till I can get enough money to move?",2020-11-22 10:06:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jytcor/wibta_for_telling_my_mum_i_have_no_interest_in/,21,31,0.93,0
962,NAH,AITA for walking out of my fiancées friend’s wedding reception?,"When I read that title, it sounds bad and I’m leaning towards thinking ITA here. 

Background: my (M29) fiancée (F33) has been asking me to go with her to a coworker’s wedding for about a few weeks. I expressed anxiety about it because 1) I’m a huge introvert, have social anxiety, and wouldn’t know anyone else 2) There’s a pandemic (I live in the US - it ended up being over 100 people, less than 5 wore masks at any given time). She put some pressure on me, told me it would mean a lot to her, and she wanted me to meet her work friends. 

Was talking to a friend about making compromises for your relationship, so I decided to go and try to put on a brave face and have fun. And I really did have fun for  about the first 2 and a half hours. Still anxious but met some nice people, had a decent time. 

Then a guy starting yelling loudly near her friend (who was one of 3 Black people there) about his political views started following our group around seemingly wherever we went, yelling randomly about it then looking at him, seemingly to see if he would react. 

At that point my anxiety was bad because negative attention-seeking people like that stress me out, and he’d clearly been drinking. So we were chatting outside in a small group, feeling the anxiety getting worse. Tried to nudge her, saying we needed to head home to feed our dog (he usually eats at 6:30 and we wouldn’t get home until 10). She basically just ignored me and said he’d be fine (which is true and I should’ve just been honest about how I was feeling). 

Then they call everyone in for the speeches, I’m walking behind my SO and as soon as I hit the doorway I kinda freak out. All of the lights and people and noise just hit me, so I turned around and just walked to the car. Didn’t have my phone to text her, so I just stood out there for 15-20 minutes. 

When she came out she was pissed. She cried and told me how upset, angry, and hurt she was for most of the hour and a half drive home until she just stopped talking. This was yesterday and all day she’s barely spoken to me. When she has, it’s been very short. Tried to explain my side but she said she feels like she has to concede to make me comfortable. 

For some context, we moved 800+ miles from our family and friends for our careers 2 years ago. It’s been difficult to find people we connect with. She said it hurt the most that she was “finally having a good time” and feeling comfortable here and I couldn’t stick it out for her.

I get how disappointing that must have felt, but it also feels like she has no empathy with me. AITA?",2020-10-11 23:12:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/j9fnhc/aita_for_walking_out_of_my_fiancées_friends/,107,417,0.93,0
963,NAH,WIBTA if I reject the gift my dad gave me before he went into major surgery?,"My father has a brain tumor and is currently in surgery to get it removed. They do not know if it's cancerous or not. Before he left for the city this morning he handed me a wrapped gift that felt like a book. I was very confused but also touched, thinking it was some kind of sincere hand-written booklet or something sweet. I love my dad very much. I told him I love him, hugged him, and he an l and my brother went on their way (brother driving).

I asked my mom what it was he gave me and she responded that my father wanted to give me something ""in case he doesn't come back."" Obviously, this scared me. This is real. This is happening. All I could do was hope for the best. I was too tired and emotional and I hadn't slept so I decided not to open it.

Well, I opened it just a moment ago. As I feared, it's a Bible- and a nice one. The thing  is, I left Christianity about six years ago- and gladly so. He knows this. He knows I strongly disagree with the Bible as it goes against everything I stand for as a human being. I feel as though the teachings of this book have personally hurt me.

My issue is... Why did he give me a Bible knowing I'm against it? Was it to soothe himself? Does it make him feel reassured? Or did he give me a Bible to disrespect my religious beliefs/lack thereof? I honestly don't understand. I'm usually pretty good at reading people and understanding why they do certain things or act certain ways but I'm at a loss.

I'm thinking of just placing the book on his bed for when he returns but I don't want to hurt his feelings. I just feel constantly invalidated and disrespected by my family and I'm tired of it. Maybe I'm looking at this with too much bias?

Anyway, Reddit, WIBTA if I return the Bible my dad gave me before he went into surgery?


**UPDATE:** Thank you dearly for all of your comments and honest answers. You guys really made me think from multiple different perspectives and got me thinking. I've decided to keep the book for now and *maybe* talk about it once he's recovered.

SURGERY UPDATE: My father is out of surgery. It went really well and he's recovering in ICU. They managed to remove 95% of the tumor (more than they thought they could) throughout the 10+ hour surgery. I'm so happy he's doing well all things considered. It's like a heavy weight released in a heavy sigh.

**SECOND UPDATE:** My father is on a ventilator and needed a drain tube because there was a build-up of pressure in his brain. He wasn't responding. I was just told he's awake and answering questions with thumbs up or down. This is great news. Docs say he's out of the woods for now but they're watching him closely.

964,NAH,AITA for taking my NICU visitation time as a father?,"My wife and I just had our first child. The baby came very prematurely and has medical problems related to that, which means she has to stay in the NICU. Unfortunately, new policies this year mean that parents are only allowed to visit their children in the NICU once a week each. If there is only one parent for a child, that parent can come twice a week.  

I tried to give my wife as much time as possible because she is the mom and was trying to pump, which they only accepted if it was done at the hospital, but after two weeks, pumping wasn't going to happen, and I really wanted to try to bond too. I had only seen the baby once, and not even a solid look. It's hard to bond with someone that you've never seen, and I want to be involved too. 

I've started taking my day a week, cutting my wife's time to one day a week also. She's devastated. We had a major argument where she said she felt that the baby was being taken from her even more. I tried to explain my side, but she didn't listen and spent the night with her parents, who are now calling me to say that they understand that it's not fair, but I ""need to understand that it's much harder on the mom than the dad"". Even my mother is saying that I should have introduced the idea more slowly and given her more time to compromise and accept losing more time, as the baby will likely be in the NICU for months.",2020-10-04 14:19:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/j4znfe/aita_for_taking_my_nicu_visitation_time_as_a/,179,291,0.95,0

966,NAH,AITA for losing my patience with my SO?,"Me (20F) and my SO (26M) have been together for almost a year (next week is our 1st anniversary).

So hes hard of hearing (he wears a hearing aid to help him to hear) so he has a issue with waking up since he cant really hear his alarm. 

For the past year i have been travelling over every weekend (1hr+ commute) to wake him up before we go out together. My country is small so its pretty much one end to the other.

But sometimes ill just ask him to meet me outside instead as I dont have time to commute the 1 hour over. And since he has a hard time waking up, ill spam call him till he wakes up. Annnd he still can be late (30mins-1hr) because he loses track of time and takes his own sweet time to prepare.

Before this i was in a 3 year toxic rs which my ex always ditched me and made me wait, and i always spend hours waiting downstairs his house and calling him before he eventually wakes up.

My current bf treats me well, but its just his time issue that i cant stand. Everytime i tell him off he says okay im sorry ill try etc. But it happens again and again each time i ask to meet outside. Im also sick of babysitting him by waking up early just to prepare and go over to wake up him and wait for hik to prepare before we can head out.

So today we are supposed to meet at 1pm. I started calling him at 1045am to get him to wake up. He wakes up and then never replies me all the way. I assume that he fell back asleep (happened before) so i got pissed off and lost my patience with him on text. 

He replied me at 1140am saying that he was in the shower and blamed me for assuming that he fell back asleep. He knows that i need the assurance to know that the person im meeting wont MIA on me, especially him since he has difficulty waking up and the tendancy to fall back asleep. He claims i dont understand him or try to because of his hearing issue, he cant wake up properly. But ive been accommodating and trying to be understanding. But the constant fear and anxiety i get from him not waking up is taking a toll on me.

Now that I have Fridays off my wife is asking me to do more chores because I have an extra day off. I disagree, I work the same hours a week she does, and therefore we should do equal chores. I'm not asking that she do more than half of the chores in the house, but why should I be doing more labor. Currently, we both work 40 hours a week and a handful of domestic hours. She wants to decrease her payload of domestic work and increase mine.

I don't see how this is fair at all. Even some of my friends are saying that I should take up more chores since I have a Friday off and it would mean a lot to her to come to a clean house and no chores on Friday. I seriously don't know what I'm doing wrong for standing up for myself for wanting equal chores.

970,NAH,AITA for telling my dad my being happy for and supporting him doesn't mean my beliefs changed?,"My (20f) parents were both very spiritual people and when I was little they taught me that when we grieve for people, we always save their place in our lives, so that when the day comes we're reunited, it's like going back to the way things were at their best. My mom and dad both had their stories about how if you lose a spouse you find ways of enriching your life until you can be reunited. The idea was you don't remarry because marriage to your one true love is sacred. And I grew up loving that and believing in it because who doesn't love the idea that the great love of your life is with you even if they pass and you will be together again once you make it through life.

Then my mom died and my dad remarried. I was 9 when my mom died and 11 when my dad remarried. It was a huge blow to me and shattered what I was raised to believe in. I spent a long time hating that my dad had remarried and threw away his chance to be with my mom again, and that he had changed our whole family. I didn't like her because of this and I was distant and in a lot of pain. Over time, a lot of time, it got better and when I was 16 I finally started to be happy for him and I supported what he did.

But to me, I still hold onto the ideal of what he and my mom taught me. This has come up again because my boyfriend and I have been telling our daughter (2) the stories that my parents told me. We even got both of them printed into books so when she's a little older she can read them too. My dad saw one of the books and didn't like that I was still clinging to those stories. He said he thought things had changed for both of us when my mom died. I told him it wasn't fair for him to expect me to stop believing in something he and my mom taught me to be true, or at least true to us, and that I still supported him and was happy for him, but I will always believe what I believe, or maybe something has to change for me.

My dad looks at it as me feeling like my stepmom isn't his true wife and she's not a true part of my family. The former is untrue. I learned to accept she is just as much his wife as my mom. I do still have some mixed feelings on the latter. But in general I have accepted he loves her and she is part of our lives. I have grown to like her. He also isn't happy that I worded it the way I did, like it was such a tough thing for me to be happy for him and support him in his marriage. He thinks I should apologize. For what exactly, I'm not so sure, I think maybe he feels I'm being not quite truthful or trying to use what he said to me in the past to hurt him. But its not true. It's just now we hold very different beliefs. And that's okay. He's still my dad and I still love and respect how he feels. I just want the same from him.

Her mom and his wife passed away a year ago. They were both super upset as she was a great mom and a great wife. I tried to do everything that I could to help and support them. When I went to speak with her dad I told him that I planned to ask his daughter to marry me soon. We are both a little old fashioned so we agreed that I would talk to him beforehand. He was really happy to hear the news and gladly agreed. We talked about planning for the engagement to make it really special for the family since it would soon be anniversary of the death. He suggested that I do it on the day of, and to honor her mother so it is like she is there with us. He thought that it would make her feel better. I liked the idea and agreed. 

Well the day finally came. To propose I was going to take her to the spot where we met. I also had a special gift for her to give her before I proposed. It was a necklace with her mother’s writing on it. I started out by giving her the necklace. She loved it and was sobbing. While she was focused on it I got down on a knee and got the ring out. When she noticed it I didn’t get the reaction that I expected. She was like “what is this? What are you doing?” I tried to ask for her to marry me. She cut me off mid sentence and said “no, no, no. Stop please.” I got quite and didn’t know what to do. She said “are you really trying to propose to me on this day? Are you serious?” I told her I was 100% serious. She said “I can’t believe this. You can’t use this day to do that. This is so disrespectful.” I tried to apologize and tell her that I did know it would hurt her. I tried to explain that I did it to try and make it a happy, special day. She told me to take her and drop her off at her dads. He came out smiling until he saw her face. He was confused too. She left the car and ran inside before either of us could say anything. I explained what happened to her dad and he didn’t understand it and said that he felt awful for me.

She is usually great about compromise, but this is in her words ""the city she wants to live for the rest of her life"". I have said in the past that I would be ok with potentially living there but I also have family in another city.

974,NAH,AITA For telling my boss I wont work on a day off even though his wife is going to chemo?,"Ok so I'm not going to deny that it's a totally selfish thing I'm doing.

I was cooking dinner tonight and my boss called my phone 6 times and texted me twice (it was in my pocket, only reason I even looked at it was because I was changing the music I was listening to) asking me to call him to talk about ""The schedule.""

So I thought ""Ahh this should be quick and easy."" (WRONG) So I call him.

ME: ""Hey boss whats up? I'm in the middle of cooking but I can talk for a sec.""

Boss: ""Why are you cooking so late? Never mind I need your help"" (Fucking 8:45 pm because I am a grave shift employee so yeah I was cooking late...)

Me:""Yeah... What can I do for you?""

Boss: ""So I'm working really hard to get you your 40 hours but they (being the security company I work for) don't want to do that but I'm working really hard, also I'm working hard to get your vacation settled. So my wife has Chemo tomorrow and I need you to work 6 am until I can find someone to cover you ( LITERALLY any other time he's said it like that I always end up working 12+ hours) You'll be getting lots of over time and you need it yes? Yeah so I work hard to get you hours you can do this for me?""

Me:""I didn't know your wife has cancer...

Boss: ""You didn't know? Everyone else knows...""

Me: ""Yeah no one else is going to tell me your personal business..."" \*totally feeling the only reason he told me just now even though everyone else knows this is to use it to guilt trip me into doing this for him\* Look boss I gotta call you back I'm in the middle of cooking and trying to concentrate on this and not burning my self so I need to get back to you.""

\*we hang up\* NOT 5 min later I get a text

Boss: ""Did you decide to help me?"" 2 min goes by Boss: ""I really need you to help me on this."" 5 min goes by

(just finished cooking and serving dinner not even had a bite yet) \*text him back\* Me: ""Sorry I can't. I've made plans on Tuesdays and they aren't reversible.""

Boss: ""WOW. Thanks."" \*prayer emoji\*

I then put my phone on airplane mode because I just knew I was going to get an onslaught of texts and calls from others because \*I\* Ruined their day by them having to work on their days off...

I should be allowed my days off... Right? So AITA?

EDIT: Yes I am aware that he is allowed to ask me for help, I totally get that and expect it, but instead of being like ""Wife has chemo, I work hard to get you hours, I work hard to get your vacation"" How about we don't guilt trip me and just ask me straight up ""Hey can you work tomorrow, SO and So called out sick for tomorrow"" and then I would say ""No, because busy"" and that would be that.

975,NAH,AITA for not trying on clothes because my grandmother insulted my disability?,"Hiya. Longtime lurker, firsttime poster here. So this actually happened several years back, but it always comes back up amongst the family around Christmas time.
So because of my turbulent upbringing, I (20F) lived with my grandmother for a few years while in high school. I was born with an eye condition that eventually left me totally blind. My grandmother was never around much when I was growing up, so she doesn't really understand how independent I actually am and also doesn't respect some of my boundaries as a disabled person. For example, she gets upset when I tell her to let me do things independently, asks really intrusive questions like ""How do you clean up after yourself when using the bathroom?"" (I wish I was kidding), and just generally treats me like I know less about being blind than she does.
So a few Christmases back, I asked my grandmother for new clothes for Christmas so I could have a new wardrobe for college. She seemed pretty excited about this, and so was I. A few weeks before Christmas, she came into my room and asked me to try on some clothes so she could see if they fit me. I said sure, and asked her what they looked like—what color they were, what patterns, etc. She flat-out refused because they were Christmas presents and that would ruin the surprise. I was disgusted and immediately refused to try on the clothes, because, in my estimation, she was discriminating against me based on my blindness. If I had been able to see, she would not have been able to have me try on the clothes and still keep the gifts a surprise, so I felt kind of taken advantage of. My grandmother got huffy and said I was being unreasonable, and when I asked other family members later, they were split on whether I was the AH or not in this situation. So, years later, after many sideways comments and blow-up fights with G-ma about how I'm an entitled and stubborn disabled person, I'm taking my woes to Reddit.

976,NAH,AITA for making other plans during my husband’s birthday weekend?!,"Background: I’ve been working from home since March, and going to school online. Basically never leave the house anymore. About a month ago, my husband said that I’m “always home” and that I should basically start getting a life again.

Flash forward: My husband’s birthday weekend is coming up so I ask him what he wants to do. Not sure if he’ll be able to take off, so we don’t plan on going anywhere.

Later, he tells me all of his plans, which include playing a one-shot D&D campaign, smoking meats, making bread, and having his friends over. So, I took a hint. Sounds to me like he wants a special weekend to himself. Got it. 

So I make plans to go out with my friends for a few hours on the day he’s smoking meats and BBQing. I say, “it should only be a few hours, but if they want to stay and have a few drinks I’m not going to rush them.” Now, he’s mad. Apparently I’m the asshole for making other plans on his birthday. He “wanted to spend time with me.” (Even though I don’t play D&D, I’m not eating meat right now, and recently he told me to leave the house more.) 

TLDR: Am I the asshole for making other plans during my husbands birthday weekend when he made his own plans that didn’t really involve me?",2020-10-10 13:03:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/j8k3zf/aita_for_making_other_plans_during_my_husbands/,89,443,0.93,0
977,NAH,AITA for telling my friend she should wait before she has kids?,"So me and 2 other friends where talking about random stuff and somehow the topic of kids came up. So then we were talking about how many kids we want in the future and when we are going to have them. So I said I wanted to have them when I turn 30. My friend said, ""Really? I want to have when as soon as I turn 21."" So I said, ""Haven't you ever seen Teen Mom? Don't you want to live a little before you have kids?"" After I said that I told her about how my brother is 21 and still in collage. So after I said that she said, ""You don't control my life.""

So now I'm wondering if I was the ass. I don't really care if she gets pregent at 21 because I will still love and support her either way. I just think you shouldn't get pregent before you finish collage. But that is still my opinion. (BTW we are 15). So Reddit AITA?

At first I used it as a friendly way to confirm I have already been informed of information.  However as time went on, and people began to verify I knew some rather basic information.  It began to take on an air of snark to it.  My boyfriend HATES IT because I use it to confirm everything.

He has told me before that he hates when I say that and has asked/told/growled at me to stop.  I said, I won’t have to say it if you actually gave me new information.

980,NAH,AITA for making noise while working out,"My girlfriend and I rent a second floor condo unit. We have a downstairs neighbour who's a middle-aged single guy who lives alone and we generally have a good relationship with him. He owns the unit. Local noise regulations essentially say you can't make a lot of noise between 11pm-7am, but reasonable noise is expected to be tolerated outside of those hours. 

We work out at home between 7am-8am on weekdays before we head to work. We've never been gym-goers, but Covid has left us with no choice either way. Our workouts are entirely strength-based training (i.e. there's no aerobics/jumping around) and we have those cushion puzzle mats set up in the room we use to exercise. I have absolutely no doubt that it makes some noise whether it's the floor creaking or some weights clanging around a bit. However, we're very gentle with putting weights back down on the floor. We also don't play any music because we use headphones. 

After I finished my workout this morning, we got a knock on the door. Guy downstairs said it was /really/ noisy and a disturbance. We apologized and he went on his way - it was a polite exchange. 

However, I'm now at a crossroads. I hate having to work out in the evenings because my job (law) is often unpredictable and some days I end up in the office fairly late. The last thing I want to do after being in the office for 12 hours is start lifting weights. Getting it done in the morning allows me to stay on track. On the other hand, I do like the guy. He's been a good neighbour and I chat with him fairly regularly when we're both out on our balconies. He doesn't work much (part-time freelancer) and he's typically up really late, so I assume he's often sleeping late as well which is why it's an issue for him.

I know I'm within my legal rights to tell him to just deal with it, but if I do that, AITA?",2020-11-27 12:48:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k20i37/aita_for_making_noise_while_working_out/,25,8,0.79,0

I have a sister (10) and he literally acts like he’s the same age. Insulting her and there’s been times my mom had to break up a verbal fight because he wouldn’t stop. He’s always clingy to my mom and my dad is even getting annoyed with it. He has a set schedule and if you do anything to interfere with it (Get the mail, take a shower one hour before he does) he’ll throw a temper tantrum.

982,NAH,AITA for sleeping over at my brother's?,"I (19F) have always been close with my older half-brother (24M). He kind of took care of me when we were growing up because neither of our dads was around and my mom was working all the time, and besides that wasn't super interested in her kids beyond the basics. My mom got remarried when I was a senior in high school so I never really got to know my stepdad or two stepsisters, and at college I'd choose to stay at my dorm during breaks because I didn't want to intrude on their ""happy family"" or whatever.

Now my school's closed down and gone online due to COVID, so I'm back at home. My mom keeps pushing me to bond with my stepsisters; they seem like okay kids but they're a lot younger so we don't really have a lot in common. My mom and I have minor clashes constantly, she thinks my bro influenced me too much/turned me against her, she thinks I'm in my room on my laptop too much, I make jewelry as a hobby/side business and she thinks I'm being rude not teaching my stepsisters or letting them use the beads as they keep asking. On the flip side I'm kind of resentful that she didn't give overly large of a fuck about me all the years I was growing up and now she's got these shiny new white kids and a husband and suddenly she's mom of the year, and that sometimes results in me being unnecessarily petty with her. All that to say, sometimes things become pretty toxic. My brother lives in a city close by, so when it gets too much I take the train over there and spend the night. We watch a couple movies, play cards or chess, drink with his neighbors sometimes. I sleep on his couch and commute back when my mom realizes I'm gone.

My brother recently started dating someone from his work (25F), and she's been over his apartment a bunch. Of course I try to give them their privacy, stay in the living room doing my own thing, but I also understand wanting the apartment to themselves, and when I was looking through my brother's texts she said something about his kid sister always being around. My brother defended me but I feel like it's also not great to him, like who wants to have sex when the sibling whose diapers you changed is in the next room. My mom is also mad that I keep going over there, and she said I can't just keep running away when things get rough, and that my stepdad is helping with my tuition so I owe it to him to make an effort. But I do chores and everything, I just want to live my life and let them live theirs.

984,NAH,AITA for disagreeing with my wife when she says she’s been abused by hospital staff during birth,"I (f27) have been with my wife (f39) for seven years, married for two. And she gave birth to our daughter two months ago. She carried our child because of medical history in my family. 

She had a bad delivery. Very long and painful and she does not handle pain well. She did not want to have an epidural because she wanted to be completely present during the birth and I totally understand and support her in her decisions. 

Towards the end of her delivery she started to get quite hysterical from the pain, and yes this was very understandable but she started to get so hysterical with her breathing, movement etc. that is was becoming dangerous for her and the baby. 

Myself, the doctors and nurses all tried to get her to be as calm as possible and eventually the doctor needed to get firm with her and myself and a nurses needed to hold her down a little bit because to baby was in distress and my wife was not doing well either. This way our daughter was eventually born and she was so good. My wife got pain medication (which she wanted and planned for) and she was doing much better as well. 

Now 2 months later we finally get to see some people and introduce our daughter. But my wife has been telling everyone that she had a very traumatic birth, which is absolutely true and I don’t disagree with. But she has also been telling everyone how the doctors and nurses abused her, screamed at her and constrained her. Of which only the last part is a little bit true because it was necessary for her safety and our daughter. She even blames me a little bit for ‘enabling the doctors and not supporting her’ 
I usually just keep quite but inside I’m quite offended for myself but mostly for the doctors and nurses who worked so hard to help her. 

AITA for disagreeing with her?

Edit: I don’t disagree with the fact that she had a traumatic birth. What I disagree with is how she personally holds the doctors and hospital responsible. And that she tells everyone to never go to that hospital, to never go to that doctor or that nurse. She even had a discussion with a friend on how you can never trust doctors in general and how they never respect patients.

985,NAH,AITA: For wanting to leave my job?,"The company I work for plays this weird game where they open promotions on the internal job board already knowing who they’re promoting. 

Around this time last year, my manager (we’ll call her MGR1) told me to apply for a senior role on a new client I had been introduced to (most larger clients have a senior role). I went through the interview process and everything, only to be told the position was opened to retain someone else. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. 

MGR1 ended up leaving the company at the beginning of this year, and my current manager (we’ll call her MGR2) has been leading the team ever since. Soon after she became my manager, the senior on the account I primarily work on quit without notice. At the same time, another person on our team was out on maternity leave (we’ll call her Sarah.) I took on a bunch of extra work (and keep in mind, MGR2 is totally new to this client, so support was very limited) on top of all of my normal duties in order to keep the team afloat.

And then one day, I get a call from MGR1 saying she wants to offer me a position at her new company working under her. I decided to go ahead and interview, and used her offer as leverage with MGR2 for a raise. I got the raise (it really wasn’t much) and declined MGR1’s offer. I was told by MGR2 that all the work I did through all the transition was appreciated and that I was getting the pay to get the “senior” title at a later date. I stayed with the company because I saw a path of growth for myself, given that they were retaining me, and I was being placed in a leadership development program. 

Well, a few weeks ago, a team lead (higher than a senior role) position opened up on our team. I did NOT apply for it because I knew exactly who the position was opened up for (we’ll call her Maggie.) I knew that Sarah (the one out on maternity leave earlier this year) also applied, and she knew that she would also not be getting the job, as it was intended for Maggie. Today, Sarah tells me that our suspicions were indeed true and the position was opened up for Maggie. BUT Sarah also mentioned that MGR2 offered her Maggie’s senior role, and that the position would be opened up internally for Sarah’s application to be moved into it, but she would not announce the opening to the team, and to keep the whole thing under wraps. 

My manager knows I’ve wanted the senior role and knows that I stayed with the company because I saw myself in a position to grow. It really seems like she wants Sarah’s opening to be kept under wraps because she knows it would really hurt me. I’ve taken on so much work these past few months, completely turned around inefficient processes, and have made things run so much more smoothly, and I’m upset that she’s not giving anyone else the chance to prove themselves.

988,NAH,WIBTA if I asked my friend to stop telling her husband everything?,"The title sounds bad but I didn't know how else to word it. My (21f) bestfriend (21F) tells her husband (19M) absolutely everything. Normally I would think that being this open with your S/O is really fantastic, especially for a couple as young as they are, but sometimes I don't want everything that I tell her to be told to him as well. 

I have a lot of trust issues and some issues with my mental health and I've recently started going to counseling. One of the things I'm working on is being more open with expressing my emotions and stuff like that so I'm trying to be more open with her and tell her about some of what I'm going through, but she tells him everything and I'm not always comfortable with that. One of my biggest issues is trusting men and I get really frustrated when I work up the courage to tell her something that may not seem like a big deal to her but is extremely difficult for me to talk about, and then she goes and tells him everything, especially if I'm not ready for him to know. Maybe it wouldn't bother me so much if I didn't know that she told him everything, but afterwards she will come back to me saying something like ""so husband and I were talking about you and what you told me and this is what he thinks.""

Don't get me wrong, I do trust her husband and I absolutely adore him, but I don't always want him to know everything I'm dealing with. And this hasn't just happened with her telling him about my issues. Currently there is a lot of tension in our friend group because I was venting about a different friend (X) and how X reacted to an unrelated situation and he was frustrated with a few of us in the friend group. I 100% agree that I was the asshole because someone could see this as gossiping about our group, but I was genuinely just venting about the situation and she goes and tells her husband and now friend X is mad at me because he doesn't understand why I told her in the first place. 

So WIBTA if I asked her not to tell her husband everything we talk about?

989,NAH,AITA for wanting to euthanize my sick dog?,"Some years ago my dog was neutered and due to an infection he lost his right eye and got an ulcer on his left, so far so good, we took care of the remaining eye and prayed for improvement.
    Around March of that year when the pandemic started here in Brazil, Ted (my dog) started to have epileptic seizures for no apparent reason, we did every kind of test possible and nothing was discovered, we started giving medication and so we went, until October, when the seizures came back stronger than ever, we took it to the vet who prescribed that we increase the dose. After this last crisis he was never the same, he was paralyzed for about 5 days, we had to feed him with porridge for spoon, besides when he moved again he did not attend anymore by his own name and had become aggressive not letting us touch or approach.
    The worst of all was this Saturday when we noticed that his mouth was bleeding, but because of the aggressiveness we couldn't approach to check what was wrong, so we sent a message to the vet who took care of him and I think for fear, she didn't want to attend him. We took care of him the way we could until Monday and by some miracle he let us take him to another vet, when we got there, he was sedated for being aggressive, after checking, Vet said that he had a very bad wormhole inside his mouth and they would have to operate to take out everything that had already been eaten, obviously we allowed the operation and unfortunately all the sky of the mouth had to be taken out, leaving exposed the communication between the nose and the mouth.
    In addition, a mass was found inside the mouth that could be a possible cancer.

990,NAH,AITA for not wanting my mom to store her valuables in my new room?,"Firstly, I feel like it's important to clear out that I am a high school junior. Long story short, my mom and I recently moved in with my stepfamily. She's been sorta living here since mid-2019 and fully moved in after they married earlier this year, when I joined. I don't have a room here yet , so I sleep in the couch. Plans for my new room are finally coming togerther, and it should start being made in a few weeks. We were chit-chatting the other day when the subject entered the conversation. She told me that she wants to make a cabinet with a fake bottom for her to store her jewels and other valuables in. I told her that I didn't feel comfortable with that since it would be very expensive stuff and she would have to come into my room to get them, and asked why couldn't she store them in their room. She said that it was because they wouldn't have the space to do so for now, and that when they made another cabinet they would take the stuff out. She said she was dissapointed in me and it was greedy of my part for what I said. I feel like i'm in the wrong after she made her points, but I wanted to have other opinions.

991,NAH,AITA For not wanting my mom's boyfriend to stay with us.," i (17m) am living with my mom in a small apartment , she has been together with her boyfriend for around 6 months but i never got the chance to meet him . About a week ago she told me that he was going to come stay with us for a couple of days but i was totally against it , cause i get really anxious around other people especially strangers . We went a bit back and forth but at the end i backed out cause i don't really have a say as to who stays at our house and i don't really want to hurt her feelings.

I met him , turns out that he's a really good guy so i thought maybe its going to be ok , but as the days past i just mostly stayed hidden away in my room trying to stay alone as much as possible cause i got really anxious while interacting with him , and the anxiety got worse when my mom was at work cause i basically had to interact with him , so i asked my mom when he's gonna leave , she told me that they don't really know cause they are waiting for the order for him to go to Germany ( he's a trucker ) . I hold out for one more night and at the third day where shes gone for most of the day , my anxiety skyrockets so i ask her again and again if they have any news as to when he's going to leave , she replies that they don't , i'm still trying to be understanding but i start to crack a little and i ask her to basically kick him out , the answer was no of course , which i understand.

992,NAH,AITA taking an introvert holiday before getting married,"When I finished University, I moved back in with my family. Living at home, although it has been great in many ways, has also been very draining. Therefore, it has been my dream to live alone somewhere away from a busy city for a while. Preferably by the sea.

I'm getting married next year and I've told my partner that I would like to live in a different part of the country for a month before we get married. I said I would visit him every week and we could text/ call frequently. He wasn't very happy about the decision.

I know it might be seen as a little selfish, but it would give me that alone time that I need before starting a new life. Just to be clear, I am very much in love and I don't have cold feet. As an introvert who hasn't had any proper alone time in **eight years**, I feel like I just need this.

993,NAH,AITA for giving up on my Moms food truck?,"So a few years ago, my Mom bought a big box truck and had it converted into a food truck.

You cant just drive your truck into business plazas and park. You have to go through middlemen to get scheduled. These were slow usually. $200 a day most days. At the storage unit we kept our truck at, a truck owner told us about a food court made up of different food trucks. A lot of businesses around it, so the employees+ customers would come to the food court.

We would cook our food before opening, and hold them in built in heat holding pans. We had 3 long rectangular ones. Our noodle dish, pancit, took up 1 and 1/2 pans. Fried rice took a half pan. Chicken and pork BBQ 1/2 pans each. That was it. 2 other trucks that would often be on the same days as us, had a lot more variety. One was a hibachi grill, noodle/rice + 3 or 4 different protein choices, with different styles. The other was fairly similar with his menu. The first few weeks, a lot of people took interest in the new kid on the block. But after a few weeks, sales went from $600 a day to $300 a day, if we were lucky.

So, I tried to suggest that we should switch to a simpler noodle dish like lo mein. Keep fried rice. Put fried rice and lo mein in a half pan each, giving us space for 4 half pans. We could change up the different meat preparations every few weeks. She didnt understand what I was trying to tell her. So I took her to Panda Express to show her what Im talking about. She didnt see the similarity. Then, she started saying she wants to change pancit to pad thai. Our customers only option would be pad thai. Despite me telling her not everyone likes that, she insisted it will catch on, and people will just grow to like it. I already struggled convincing her to get us a ticket rack to keep orders organized. She wont take advice from anyone, even more successful truck owners. Even when people tried to tell her how to properly back her truck into her storage space, she wouldnt listen. She'd hold up everyone for near 20 minutes, while it only took everyone else 5 minutes at most. So after all this, I mentally gave up on the truck. I'd show up for shifts still and do my job. But once she started saying she feels like the truck wont be successful, I agreed. Told her she should sell it and give up. She got angry with me.

People who knew about it asked me, I'd explain my POV. Some would tell me I shouldve tried harder. Made it seem like I did nothing to help.

 I usually will make a list of whatever items tickle my particular fancy that season, when i get asked what i want for Xmas  i refer people to that list, and whatever they get me im happy with. $5 or $500 doesn't matter. 

For whatever reason my wife adamantly refuses to shop for me off the list, insisting that whatever she gets me has to be a surprise. She absolutely does make a good faith effort to get me something she feels i would like, but more often than not it falls flat, ending with stuff i never use that takes up space and i feel to guilty to get rid of.

995,NAH,AITA for asking my girlfriend to wear diapers in certain situations?,"Okay, first of all, throwaway account because I've got a couple of IRL friends who know the name of my reddit account. Now, let's get to it. 

My girlfriend (23F) has a condition usually called ""Giggle incontinence"". The short explanation is that she loses control of her bladder when she laughes, sneezes, coughs etc. As far as I know she's always had this problem and I never had any issue with it. The problem is that it got worse over the last couple of months. Before, she usually ""lost"" a couple of drops when she sneezed and actually peed herself only once or twice since I've known her when she had an extreme laughing fit. However, for the last couple of months she peed herself quite often when she sneezed or coughed. She already went to three different urologists, but all of them told her more or less that there is nothing she can do about it except training her pelvic floor muscles and hoping that it helps to lessen the amount of urine she loses. So for now it seems that the problem stays. Due to the increasing number of times she peed herself after sneezing I asked her to wear diapers in some situations. For example, she already peed twice on the passenger seat of our car and it was a nightmare to clean and dry both times. She also peed on the seat in the cinema when she had to cough at the end of a movie. When she had a cold last week, she wet our bed three times within five days. The morning after the third time I sat down to talk to her. I asked her if she would wear diapers in some situations like during longer car rides and similar situations. I also asked her to wear diapers to bed while she's still ill because it's not the best experience to wake up because your girlfriend just wet the bed. However, when I talked to her she started screaming at me and told me how much of an asshole I am for treating her like a baby and things like this. I tried to explain to her that it would be a lot better for both of us and that it would save both of us a lot of work and her a lot of embarrassment. She didn't respond to that at all and just took her bag, told me she had to get to work on time and left the house. 

So, now the important question: Am I the asshole for telling my girlfriend to wear diapers in some situations?

**Edit:** I should have clarified, but I was in a hurry typing this, so: My girlfriend already wears incontinence pads due to her condition but they don't always ""hold up"" so she leaks when she loses alot of urine. Also I'm no native speaker. I didn't use the word ""diaper"" when I talked to her, I used the word ""Inkontinenzhosen"", but I didn't find the english counterpart for this word so I used the word ""diaper"" for this post.",2020-08-18 10:44:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ibyo7n/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_wear_diapers_in/,583,3288,0.97,0
996,NAH,AITA for not allowing my friend to bring her service animal (guide dog) to my wedding?,"
I (28f) will be getting married in September. I have a blind friend who mostly relies on her guide dog. The dog obviously has access rights to all places.

Now I am in a sticky situation and I can sense that I will be TA. I have three chronic illnesses that I take 23 pill a day for, severe asthma and you guessed it, an extremely severe dog allergy. Usually when I meet with my friend we meet in the open and I take two allergy pills. However, because of all the other medication I take these pills make me extremely drowsy to the point where I am officially not allowed to drive and I usually crash as soon as I get home from our get togethers.

Our wedding will be very intimate, i.e. we will be in relatively small rooms. I feel horrible about this but I don’t think I can let my friend bring her dog. It just wouldn’t work. I talked about it with my fiance and some friends. Finally, I talked to my friend about it, explained the situation and said I would love her to come but she can’t bring her dog. I said that four of our mutual friends had offered to “be on a roster” and assist her should she need it. Alternatively, if she is not comfortable with this she could bring a person of her choosing to the wedding or I’d pay for a professional aid for the day. I think it is important to note that her dog is not for any additional issues like seizures or anything like that.

Unfortunately, she was less than happy with my suggestions. She accused me of being ableist and thinking her disability can be switched off for the day.

I understand what I asked was a lot and it is a difficult topic. I told her to tell me if she changes her mind and I’d be happy to make arrangements. But I won’t budge.

997,NAH,AITA for ordering and eating more than my friends?,"TW: eating disorders, food, numbers!!

A little bit of background: I developed an eating disorder at the beginning of 2020. I lost about 20% of my body weight and I was restricting and over exercising. Obviously this had a lot of terrible effects on my health. I lost my period and I had other effects from the low hormone levels. It honestly got pretty bad, and no one could tell because it was during quarantine and I couldn't see anyone.

About a month ago I decided I was tired of it. I was tired of constantly freezing, of feeling like passing out when I got up, of not being able to sleep because my hips dug into my bed, of not even being able to look in the mirror without wanting to cry. Well I decided to get help and I'm now seeing a therapist and a dietician.

Together, we decided that I should try an ""all-in"" or intuitive eating approach, in which I basically eat whatever I want whenever I want to. A couple of days after I started eating again, I noticed that I was always incredibly hungry. I mentioned it to my dietician and apparently it's extreme hunger, which happens to a lot of people recovering from EDs, and it's because the body needs a ton of food to recover all the damage that's been done to it. She also told me to always, always indulge it, so since then I've been eating way more than a normal person would. And honestly I've been doing a lot better. I've put on some more weight, I feel better about food, and I don't feel like passing out everytime I get up.

Yesterday I went out to dinner with four friends for the first time in forever. This was a huge step for me because I've always felt insecure about eating around other people. 

It was a sort of place where you order each course separately. When we got there they all got drinks, but I didn't because I'm trying to cut down on alcohol. Then they said they were going to split two appetizers, and asked me if I wanted to split with them. I was starving so I said no and got my own. Then they all got an entree, so I did too. I also got two sides because they looked good. At the end, my friends said they were going to split a large dessert. I decided I would get three of the mini ones, because I wanted to try some new things out.

I didn't notice anything off during the meal and we parted and said we would do it again sometime. This morning, I texted the group chat and said I really enjoyed the meal and hoped we could do it again soon. I didn't get an answer but didn't think much of it.

This afternoon though I got a text from the friend I'm closest to. She told me that she felt bad and wanted to be honest, and that they all didn't really want me to eat with them again. She said that they felt uncomfortable with how much I was eating, and that two of them were on diets and that being around me made it hard for them. She said that they all thought it was better if we didn't do it again. Now I feel awful about how I acted. I'm going to talk to my therapist when I can, but I wanted some other opinions first.

998,NAH,AITA - Calling wife out for being enmeshed with family?,"My wife and I have been struggling for months...  long story short she got depressed for a couple years and pushed me away and now I’m having issues with not feeling like a priority because I have some resentment.  We have 3 young kids.  She’s is incredibly enmeshed with her family, her parents in particular.  They constantly guilt her into things (e.g. seeing family) and she constantly seeks their validation.  My wife and I got into an argument about the items below and she’s telling me that I’m just being an asshole about that and that they are things most people do with their family’s.

1) This is the 3rd year we’re hosting thanksgiving.  I’m the cook in the house and I put together a list of stuff that I wanted to make for thanksgiving and texted it to her asking if it looked good.  She sent it to her mom asking if I “missed anything?” and if it’s “good?”  I told her we are hosting and they are guests, if she wanted to send it to her and say “this is what we’re making can you bring something?” that would be one things but instead she’s giving her an opportunity to chime in on what we’re doing.

2) I suggested a family vacation for the week of Christmas.  She asked if it was okay to invite other people and I said “yes, but I want to do what we want.  Meaning, we are basically telling people this is what we’re doing and if you want to be there with us that’s great.”  Her parents are the only ones going with us and see us about 1/3 of the week.  We’ll be 2 hours away from where her 93 year old grandmother lives...  her parents want everyone to see her grandmother (not sure if they’re going to pick her up from 2 hours away and spend the day in the area we’re staying or if they’re driving to her area to spend the day there).  I said I don’t want to because 1) she’s literally the highest risk category for coronavirus and 2) I want a family vacation where I can spend the week with her and our kids. Her parents are giving her a bit of a guilt trip about not making the time to spend with her grandmother and she’s basically calling me selfish for it.

1001,NAH,WIBTA if I moved while my mom has cancer?,"Throwaway account because privacy reasons. 

&#x200B;

So, I (25F) met someone (22F) online a while ago, and we've been together for a few months. She lives up in Ohio and I live down in Texas. We've talked about closing the gap here and there and we are thinking about moving in together sometime next year a few months after our 1 year anniversary. 

&#x200B;

Thing is, my mom (I know better than to post mommas age on the internet, F) has colon cancer. From what I hear, it's the less ""fatal"" kind of cancer, but I do know someone who's aunt died of it after they discovered her at stage 4. My mom caught it for the first time as it was reaching stage 2, and since a surgery and (A lot of) chemotherapy, they've kept it in remission/under control, and from what the doctors are saying, the cancer won't kill her but she's probably going to be going to chemo from here on. You can bet chemo takes it out of her. Every other week she goes in for chemo, and that week on chemo day and pump-removal day she is plum out of energy. In general, any day after chemo day she's in general low on energy.   


What doesn't help any of this is due to other medical problems, my stepdad/her husband is bedridden. So, any tasks he would do someone else has to do. Some things I am able to help with, but some of these things ma hires a professional. However, now my ma has to take care of him (Pooping, bathing, etc) and that certainly takes even more energy out of her. She doesn't have to do all of the changing and bathing for him, as there is a professional who is much stronger than any of us that help with that during the day, but they ain't there all the time. So if a blowout happens at 3AM then... well...

&#x200B;

She doesn't *rely* on me, but I do what I can to help her. Getting last minute groceries that were forgotten, some gardening/landscaping, running by the house to feed the dogs if she's going to be out late for one reason or another, restoring an old laptop, etc. Since I'm in the area, I'm more than happy to help her in any way that I can. All she has to do is give me a ring. She raised me, she beat addiction and worked to rebuild our relationship, she helped me with education, and I kinda feel like an ass for thinking about leaving the area, especially since I moved back into the area from some other part of Texas just this last summer.

Because of covid it's been impossible to make friends, my circles consist of my bf and people how I've met through him with whom I'm on hello basis. My partner is my only friend here.

Here's my issue;
I know it's not my partners responsibility to make new friends for me, and I wouldn't really want him to. But I do sometimes get jealous when he goes out with his friends for coffee, drinks, food etc. (We do these things together as well, just us, not why I'm jealous).

1005,NAH,AITA for telling my grandparents I don't like gifts they send based on things I like as a 6 year old?,"TL;DR: I'm 26 and my wealthy grandparents keep sending me random cat themed items as gifts, I've asked for practical things. 
I [26 F] have been in contact with my paternal grandparents (they live in another state, as does my father) since I was 6/7 ish because my biological father hid my existence from them until my mom sought child support from him. I will just mention quickly they and my biological father are independently wealthy people. 
As I grew older, they visited me more than my father and we formed a bond. I love then very much. We have been exchanging emails a couple times a week since I was in high school. They have sent me boxes for Christmas and my birthday every year, even including gifts for my mom and half-sister (not their grandchild) in the Christmas boxes while I was under 18. They still send me the boxes to my apartment. 
All seems nice, right? 
The boxes have no evolved much over the 2 decades. As a little kid I would tell anyone and everyone I loved cats, favorite animal hands down. I still love cats, the pets. I have never desired to wear or own cat themes items, however. I like the live critters. I have 2 with my SO. They are our babies. 
Every box has at least 5 cat items, be they kitchen towels, clothes, figurines (soooo many figurines), cheap tech accessories, decor, and even this year a cat shaped litter scoop! 
I have told them very nicely I would prefer practical items for my home if they want to send gifts, but of course I don't need any gifts, I genuinely enjoy sharing the emails and cards just fine.

1006,NAH,WIBTA for telling my girlfriend I'm not ready to move in together until she has a stable/better job or a career goal?,"Me \[23M\] and my girlfriend \[24F\] have been dating for three years and hoping to move in together soon. We get along great and have a really loving and supportive relationship. We both recently graduated from a prestigious university, my degree was in engineering, hers was a double major in Spanish and linguistics. We've been long-distance for a couple of months because of the pandemic (both of us living at home so we can save up money).

I recently accepted a really exciting job that will pay me more than I expected ($100k+ , although in a fairly expensive city), and have always had pretty lofty/defined goals for my career and work really hard to reach them. My girlfriend used to be really passionate about things but the more I've gotten to know her, the more I've realized that she doesn't have very many aspirations. She's floated the idea of getting into law but that's as far as it's gone. I'm sure it's a combination of the family she grew up in and her confidence level, but she seems perfectly content working the checkout line at a grocery store. This sort of worries me because a) I know she is still paying off student loans and b) my mom is the same way, no life goals, and hasn't worked for 23 years, let alone last 8 or so since I've been independent enough to not need mothering or the 4 years I was away at college, and I've seen the pressure that puts on my dad to make enough to support the family.

I know my girlfriend is unsure about what kind of career she wants, which is completely understandable, but it seems really foreign to me to have so much potential (a friggin double major at a top school!!) but not have a single goal to work towards besides moving in with me. You definitely don't need to have your whole career planned out at age 20, very few of us do, but almost everyone I know has some sort of goal to work towards even if that goal changes over time. (Isn't the average number of career changes like 5-7!?)

So to the question, WIBTA if I tell her I want to wait to move in together until she has a full-time job or at least a somewhat defined plan for how to move forward with her career? Right now her part time jobs probably put her in the $10-20k salary range with few benefits. I'm not so much worried about the money right now, just that her lack of motivation makes me uneasy about our future (she hasn't applied to or even looked for any full-time jobs in the 6 months since she graduated) and I don't want either of us to end up feeling like she's reliant on my income to get by in an expensive part of the country. If for some reason we break up in the future, she probably wouldn't be able to afford rent in the area, and that would be an awful situation all-around. We have a lot of the same interests outside of work and have a really loving and supportive relationship, but seeing her motivation the past 6 months has made me start to question whether we have compatible long-term goals for life/standard of living/retirement.

Edit for clarification: The way I phrased it originally, it comes of like I'm fixated primarily on the fact that she hasn't found a job or chosen a career. I have tons of friends who are in the same boat. My main concern is actually that she hasn't put in any effort over 6 months or during college to start looking/exploring options, whether that's googling jobs or talking to people in different professions. 

Also lots of comments have said that I'm coming off as very judgmental, which I completely accept. I'll definitely take some time to try to rethink my attitude on some things. Thanks for pointing that out.",2020-11-20 06:28:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jxk3bl/wibta_for_telling_my_girlfriend_im_not_ready_to/,52,4,0.64,0
1007,NAH,AITA for not paying for my daughter to relax her hair?,"I (37F) have a multi-racial daughter (13). I am black, and her father is white and South Korean. 

Both of us have natural hair. My daughter has very thick, long, and curly hair that reaches to her waist. She has many different curl patterns going on - some parts of her hair are tightly coiled, others are loose curls, and some are in between. I have two patterns on my head - tight coils on the sides, and loose curls at the top. I keep my hair medium length. 

I’ve tried to teach my daughter that how she is naturally is beautiful. I was raised by my self-hating father to believe that light skinned women with long straight hair were desired, and that I wouldn’t get a job if I looked like “I was from Africa.” So I had relaxed hair up until college, where my dad still freaked out after I cut all of my hair off and went natural. Therefore, I’ve tried to raise my daughter in a way that promotes self-love and acceptance. 

Recently, my daughter has explained to me that she thinks she’s not pretty with curly hair. She asked that I spend money to get her hair fully relaxed (permanently straightened by chemicals). I told her that of course she is beautiful with curly hair. 

She says she wants to look more like the women on her father’s side. When I try to explain to her that she is beautiful and amazing just as she is, she tells me I don’t understand because no one looks at me and expects me to have straight hair. 

So I tried a different approach of explaining what chemicals do to the hair, and that it’s irreversible. And that if she wants curly hair again, she will have to cut off the straight ends. She got more upset with me and told me that I don’t know what it’s like being “mixed.” 

Her father thinks I should just pay for the relaxer. I told him that is sending a wrong message especially since she seems to want to change her hair because of an insecurity. I said that I refuse to pay for any chemical application, and as a compromise, I will pay to get her hair silk pressed if she really wants to try having straight hair (she has always worn it curly). Of course, this is still not good enough for my daughter. 

Everyone I’ve spoken to thinks I’m the AH and am being controlling. I don’t want to control her, but I also don’t want her to go down this path of permanently changing something about herself because she feels “ugly.” I think I might be the AH because it’s true that I don’t understand what it’s like to be multiracial, and that I’m invalidating her feelings.

1009,NAH,AITA for wanting my mother to move in with me and my wife?,"Throwaway for privacy reasons. Apologies for formatting, I’m writing on my phone.

I’m a woman in my mid-30s, married to another woman. My dad passed away when I was still a child and my mom raised me and my sister on her own. She never remarried and is currently living alone.

About a decade ago, my mom was diagnosed with a medical condition that was going to make it impossible for her to live alone after a certain point. I won’t give any more personal details, but there is no cure. As my sister was then living in another country (and still is), I promised that my mother was going to move in with me eventually. I told this to my now-wife during our second date and was very clear about it from the start. She always seemed to agree and accept that.

The time has come for my mom to move in with us, as it’s no longer safe for her to live on her own without assistance. My wife is pregnant with our second child and has changed her mind about the situation. She says there’s not enough room for my mom (kind of true, but we live in a three-bedroom house and the kids can share a room while my mom takes the other one), that money is tight (even if mom is on disability) and so on. I gave her an ultimatum and told her that if she doesn’t let my mom move in, I will move out and take care of her on my own. We have been arguing for days.

AITA for wanting her to move in?

EDIT: People have asked for more INFO. My wife and I have discussed this several times during our years as a couple. She was initially fine with the idea of our children sharing a room. I will be taking care of my mother and my sister has agreed on sending us money monthly. My mother still has all her cognitive abilities, as her illness is physical. My wife changed her mind once my mother’s condition worsened and I started making preparations for her to move in. I hope this clears something up and I apologize for not writing it all in the initial post.",2020-10-14 21:21:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jb9w1n/aita_for_wanting_my_mother_to_move_in_with_me_and/,113,122,0.91,0
1010,NAH,WIBTA if I confronted my sitter for a suspected “invasion of privacy”?,"TL;DR — I *may* have found evidence that my sitter snooped around, and am wondering if I should confront them.

Anonymous because I’m not quite sure how to go about this yet, if I should even go about it at all.

My husband and I went to visit my mother (socially distanced/safe), and hired a sitter to watch over the house and our dog. They have watched over them before with no issue, and is absolutely a lovely family friend/person.

Important detail: Before we left, my husband and I made sure to close our closet doors. The reason we do this is because our dog likes to put shoes in her mouth when she gets excited, then ends up leaving them all over the house and makes a mess. We ALWAYS close the closet doors, even if we’re just leaving for the shopping.

We came back the other day, hung out with the friend for a while, then they were on their way. I went to go to the bathroom in our bedroom when I noticed that my closet door was partially open. I opened it fully and nothing was amiss—all of my shoes were in order, nothing was moved around, and because I know people will ask: NOTHING WAS MISSING.

I just thought it was kind of weird and went about my unpacking, but there was an inkling at the back of my head to check around the house, so I walked around and discovered:
- our laundry basket wasn’t in its usual spot
- my husbands uniform wasn’t where it usually is in the closet
- our bedside drawer was partially open

I could excuse the first two things as maybe our friend doing some personal laundry/using some of our hangers, but I have no idea why they would want to go through our bedside drawer. Everything that they could need—laundry pods, chargers, televisions remotes—is available for them out in the open.

It isn’t such a big deal for me—I trust our friend completely and, after all, nothing was missing—but I am a little embarrassed because there were a few personal things in that drawer that I would have rather they didn’t see. My husband isn’t upset either, we both just think it’s kind of odd.

Would I be the asshole if I *politely* confronted our friend and asked why they were snooping around, even if nothing was missing? And WERE they even snooping around, or could I just be overreacting? I just don’t want to make them potentially uncomfortable, or make a big deal out of nothing!

EDIT: I wouldn’t ask them because I am upset with them, I just want to satiate my curiosity as to “why”. Maybe they thought I was a secret spy or something cool ;)",2020-11-28 02:15:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k2eyv1/wibta_if_i_confronted_my_sitter_for_a_suspected/,20,7,0.82,0
1011,NAH,AITA for reusing my kid's name?,"I (22M) started dating my ex when we were 16. Halfway through the next year right before I turned 17 and she was still 16 she got pregnant (I was stupid, I know) It really wasn’t ideal but we wanted the baby so we decided to make it work. My parents went ballistic and I pretty much moved in with my girlfriend who’s family obviously weren’t thrilled either but were more accepting. We’d mostly picked out names and were pretty sure we had a boy name and probably girl name. I know these may have changed slightly over the months but at the time we were sure we had the names. 

She ended up miscarrying at about 14 weeks which was obviously pretty rough especially on her but I was pretty upset too and I still have weird feelings about it because I’d got used to the idea of having a kid that would be 5 now and it’s sad but I kind of feel I was given a second chance by not becoming a dad at the beginning of my last year of high school so I don’t know, mixed feelings. My ex and I also broke up about a month after this. I’m not actively talking to my ex but I have her on social media and we still have 1 or 2 mutual friends and I'm not exactly not talking to her. 

My current girlfriend is pregnant with a boy and she’s due at the end of October. My ex called me and screamed at me when she found out that the new baby has the same name that we would have given our baby if it had been a boy. I’d like to add that my dad’s family has the tradition that the oldest son’s middle name is the dad’s name. This didn’t happen with me because although I’m the oldest I also had a twin brother and my parents didn’t want to do that as we were really the same age but gave my younger brother by 2 years my dad’s name instead. My twin brother died I think of SIDS just before we turned 1 which I also feel weird about because obviously it’s sad but I really don’t remember him although sometimes I wonder what it would have been like to have an identical twin, he’s in all my baby pictures and I mostly can’t tell if it’s him or me. 

So the boy name we picked was a nickname of my twin’s middle name and my dad’s name for middle name. I won’t pretend that I had this name picked out before my ex was even pregnant (you know, because I was 16) but I liked it and she agreed to it. I feel I have every right to use this name but I can kind of see where she’s coming from it must be weird to lose a baby and then find out your ex is naming their new kid the same name but I don’t really see it as I’m in the wrong and I think my ex is being a little unreasonable. I guess it would be different if it had been her favourite name ever but the fact is the meaning behind the name was connected to my family. 

My ex is also upset that I consider my new baby to be my first child but I don’t ever really plan on telling my kid that he could have had an older sibling. I don’t know, I can see how this is an emotional situation for my ex but I kind of want an outside opinion, AITA?",2020-10-01 03:52:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/j31any/aita_for_reusing_my_kids_name/,112,563,0.94,0
1012,NAH,AITA in this situation? Am I insensitive?,"Hello guys!

I know that this is not the right place to post this. I tried to post this in r?AskAnAmerican but they didn't let me. There are just too much words. But I really need answers right now.

I'm originally from the Philippines and I've been living in the States for 3 years now. I decided to post this because I was still bothered by what happened in my workplace a few hours ago. So I work at CVS pharmacy as a cashier and there was this black dude who wants to have his dollar changed into quarters. I didn't know what I did wrong but he called me a racist back at my workplace. So the story goes like this :

Him : Hello, can change my 1 dollar into quarters? I need coins to load my water bottle from the water machine. (This is not the exact words that he said but it has the same idea)

Me : Yeah sure! (proceeds to do his request)

Me : This is for the water right?

Him : I'm sorry what?

Me : I said, this is for the water right?

Him : Why are you asking me that? That's what I said earlier

Me : (I struggled to answer him back at this point because my English speaking proficiency is not that good so I just said : ""I was just making sure"" (You see, I was just trying to make a small conversation to the customer that's why I asked him that even though I know that he needs the coins for the water)

He then proceeds to go outside and try to refill his water bottle

Then, a few minutes later, he went back and told me this :

Him : Sir, you might not realized this but what you did earlier is where racism come from. I don't know, it might be just a cultural difference but what you did was racist!

Me : (I don't know what I did wrong at this point but I can see in his face that he was serious and that he look offended. I didn't mean to hurt his feeling so I just decided to apologize)

As Americans, who really understood your own culture, what did I do wrong in that situation. Am I insensitive? Was my question a micro aggression? You see, I'm just worried that he might report me and tell people that I'm racist. That's going to affect my reputation in my job and I don't want that to happen.",2020-11-24 03:24:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jzx5ko/aita_in_this_situation_am_i_insensitive/,23,8,0.79,0
1013,NAH,WIBTA if I reveal that I know about our family secret?,"Throwaway account because I don't want it tied to my main.

My family consists of myself (21M), my sister (34F), and my parents (61M and 55F). I thought it would be cool to research our family tree to see how far back I could get and possibly create a gift to give to my parents. While researching I came across a suspicious birth record. 21 years ago on my exact date of birth a 13 year old female with my sister's name gave birth to a boy. The records are from a state where my parents have occasionally mentioned having lived before I was born. Now I'll admit it's possible that this is just a huge coincidence, but with everything lining up so perfectly I have a strong suspicion that my ""sister"" is actually my birth mother and that my ""parents"" are my grandparents who opted to take the parental role and raise us as siblings.

My family have shown me nothing but the greatest love and support that anyone could ever ask for. If all of this is true I don't want to do anything that would massively change or damage my relationship with them. I don't believe that my perception would change but I'm worried that me knowing might cause them feelings of embarrassment or shame? I don't know if those are the right words to describe it but I doubt it would be a positive reaction.

I've talked about it with one friend and they think I should tell them, if only so that my family doesn't have to keep their guards up about the story around me or for the possibility that they could even disprove my wild claims. I'm still really feeling conflicted about the whole thing. WIBTA if I tell my family what I found?

TL;DR: My sister might actually be my mom

EDIT: Oh wow this got more attention than I thought it would. Thanks everyone for your advice. I live a few states away from everyone so unfortunately I won't be able to give an update anytime soon. After considering all of your advice I've decided the best course of action is to ask my mom first in a private 1 on 1 conversation. I figure that if something traumatic did happen then she would have the least at stake. I don't suspect my dad of any wrongdoing at all but I suppose there's always the slightest of chances.

1014,NAH,AITA for ditching my boyfriends family on thanksgiving while at their house?,"To start, I’d like to say that no one else but me has the potential to be the asshole in this situation. 
My boyfriend(23m) took me(21f) to his parents house an hour away thanksgiving night to have dessert with them. The problem is, we have been dating more than a year and a half and I’ve only met his mom once at a store for a brief second and his sister and a group of us had gone to the movies once before. This would have been my first time actually getting to meet everyone without worldly distractions. 
Note: I have anxiety that comes with a panic disorder and depression. 
So he drove an hour to come get me, an hour back to his parents and everything was fine the whole trip there until we were parked outside of the house. Panic set in and I cried in the car for almost 45 minutes feeling trapped. At first I was too anxious to go in, then after a while too embarrassed to, and couldn’t just leave? They knew we were there. 
He ended up going in and letting his family know   What was going on then did take me all the way back home. Before leaving, his mom sent him out with apple pie and asked for me to try again sometime. He was as always understanding and kind to me, and tried to reassure me that it was okay. But now i am so humiliated by myself, and I feel like such a shitty person for doing this to everyone. I feel that i could have ruined this relationship only on my end, because now i dont know how to move past this. I’m feeling like I have no choice but to leave the relationship, because in my eyes I was a massive asshole. 
So I came here to ask, Is this something that could be looked past or am I right in thinking I was too much of an asshole to make a come back.

ETA: Im in therapy and work with a psychologist. 
Another thing that makes it so off putting of me is that his mom and I text often with no issues.",2020-11-27 13:27:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k212zi/aita_for_ditching_my_boyfriends_family_on/,22,8,0.79,0

This chat has been going for years and we have all gotten very close and we trust each other. 

There is one hiccup. The discord server was originally created by my sister-in-law (SIL, F24). I am married to her brother (M28). Obviously we have a sex life, and sometimes it comes up in the nsfw channel. I always get shade from her, and sometimes outright hostility, if I talk about the fact that her brother and I even have sex, let alone any details.

I just want to be able to participate and ask questions and give advice like everybody else. She wants me to use the spoiler tag or say “SIL DON’T LOOK AT THIS” every time, and I just don’t want to make that big of a deal about it? But I guess it’s not the end of the world if I have to. But I also feel like she might still get upset about it if I do that because she is very sensitive and has a temper.

I may be the asshole because it makes her very uncomfortable and I think she should get over the fact that her adult bother has a wife and has sex.

Another piece of info is that we lived with her for two years and she was weird about it in person too, getting super uncomfortable when it was even hinted at that we, you know, do it in our own bedroom in our own apartment that she chose to share with us.

I don’t remember when or how it happened but it happened sometime when I was 9 years old which I don’t think is old enough to be making such a life changing choice, but it happened. I started regretting it when I was 12 and did want to take it off but have been afraid of the social backlash (I live in a close knit Muslim community) and just the confrontation and telling my mom that I don’t want to wear it anymore.

I have been pushing it back every year since I have contemplated it because i’ve been so scared. To say that I will greatly disappoint my mother is an understatement, she will be completely devastated. I’ve struggled with my faith a lot and she knows that and she voices her frustrations at me not being the best possible Muslim and I feel like me doing this will just cement her worries. I’ve talked to my sister about it and she supports me and told me that although my mom will probably be disappointed, she’ll still love me no matter what.

I know i’m going to hurt her and our relationship probably won’t be the same but i’m 20 and as shallow as it may sound I want to look pretty and take advantage of my youth without feeling regret when i’m older. I feel like wearing the hijab not only confines me but i’m not even wearing it because I want to. I’m wearing it for my mom and that’s not right. I don’t want to go behind her back and take it off because lying about it would make it 100x worse so I feel like I need to come clean.

1017,NAH,AITA for telling my niece to stay in the closet until she gets her inheritance?,"My (42M) niece (17F) recently confided in me that she is a lesbian.  I supported her, let her know I'd be there, etc.  Usual ally stuff.

However, she told me she was going to come out to the whole world this week.  I let her know she should absolutely wait for her grandparents (my parents) to pass.  My father is incredibly wealthy and has tens of millions of dollars in assets that he will be passing down once he is gone.

My father is a raging homophobe who has flat out stated any gay individual in our family would be written out of the will.  And to make sure the rest of us don't just split more money with said gay relative, they will, instead, have that portion of the inheritance (put aside for that family member) donated to charitable causes.  That money will be erased from the inheritance.

Since both my father and mother are incredibly poor health, (stage 4 cancer and debilitating dementia respectively) I told my niece she should stay in the closet for a while longer.  If she comes out as a lesbian and they find out, she will quite literally lose out on 7 million dollars.

She was a little sad but was also appreciative since that is obviously a life-changing amount of money that will allow her to live luxuriously until she dies.

My wife, however, said that I am being an asshole.  I am telling this poor girl to hide who she is just to appease old bigots.  That is true, I am asking her to appease old bigots.  But I feel like her life quality will be much better with 7 million dollars at the cost of 1-2 years in the closet at tops.

I have also seen my father's will and know who is getting what, so my niece IS definitely going to receive 7 million as long as my father doesn't rewrite or edit his will.

Am I the asshole for telling my niece to stay in the closet so she can be a millionaire?

**Small update: my wife apologized for getting snippy with me and now agrees she should hide it for a year or two.

I text the boys as well but they respond maybe once a week) and that I diddnt want to pay to fly everyone out here for them to just sit on their phones.  

She has informed me she is still upset, but I really can’t afford to pay for everyone to come out here.  Maybe I am the asshole and should just say no one can come since everyone can’t. 

To be clear I love them all and do a lot of things with them, I just don’t want to pay a lot for them to sit around and stare at their phones again.",2020-10-22 17:47:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jg4jt7/aita_sil_mad_i_only_want_to_fly_my_niece_to_meet/,52,194,0.94,0
1019,NAH,WIBTA if I asked my wife to get a job?,"I (23m) have a full time job that I love dearly but I only make $10/hr, which isn't considered a living wage. My wife (26f) and I got by okay whenever she had a job before as well (she was a starbucks barista), but since then her fibromyalgia has gone into a series of bad flares and she's come to the conclusion that she just can't work anymore. I don't know what that pain is like so I can't exactly argue with her. I decided that if she tried to get disability pay and take care of the apartment, we should be okay with just my income until I get a raise. 

What I didn't know is just how long a process getting disability pay is. And how expensive everything is. And how I consistently only have like $100 free between paychecks, to be instantly spent on home needs. We had food stamps for a while, but I put her in charge of those and we apparently don't know the status of it? 

Basically, I wanted really hard to be the cool husband who can take care of everything, but I've flown too close to the sun. 

Flash to now and I'm working myself to the bone, tired all the time. The apartment barely gets taken care of, I guess I get it when she's always in pain but my job is physical so so am I, yknow? We're always broke, I'm always tired. I asked her to look for work from home jobs and she said she isn't qualified for any of them. I asked her to try math tutoring or guitar lessons and she hasn't put up any ads or found any listings. I don't know how to navigate this while salvaging my relationship. 

Literally anything I do here is gonna cause tension but I guess I gotta know, WIBTA if I asked her to just suck it up and get a new IRL job? I feel like thats insensitive to someone with chronic pain but I don't know anymore, I'm just so tired.",2020-09-25 12:29:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/izijf4/wibta_if_i_asked_my_wife_to_get_a_job/,169,407,0.95,0
1020,NAH,WIBTA for making my curry with beef instead of chicken despite my girlfriend not wanting that?,"I will be making curry and I had an idea to use oxtail because its perfect fir three reasons. One, oxtail is very flavorful but needs time to braise, using coconut milk takes a long time to thicken up, and braising oxtail in my curry would flavor it very nicely. This all works together since I need to cook for a long time to get the coconut milk to thicken and the oxtail to be tender and all the while it will flavor the curry beautifully.

Queue my picky girlfriend who wants me to use chicken. She says she is a pollo vegetarian but I don't think she actually is. She likes beef hamburgers, beef in her soup, bolognese sauce,  her steaks bloody. What I really think is going on is that she's just picky, because she is in general. She says oxtail is something no one eats and when o say plenty of people eat it outside North America she replies with ""not me"". She's never tried it. She also says beef curry is gross and when I asked her how many times she's tried it she said never but she just thinks it will be gross.

I am passionate about cooking. I love trying new things and I don't like being limited to the most generic cuts of meat and chicken and ingredients. So wpuld i be the asshole if i used beef?",2020-10-24 13:34:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jh8zyk/wibta_for_making_my_curry_with_beef_instead_of/,91,51,0.87,0

I got my 14yo brother a $300 Amazon gift card (there is an Amazon store by their house) and my a big trampoline for my 7yo brother. I told my parents and they were upset with me. They said it was excessive and I should not try to ""out do them."" I think their X-mas gifts were going to be crap from Dollar General.

1022,NAH,AITA for showing my friend a lifetime countdown calendar without knowing that she had 'Thatnotophobia'?,"I recently stumbled across an interesting print on the Stoicism subreddit which depicts the average 80 year human lifespan in a number of boxes- a box for every week of an 80 year life. The person who owns this print had blacked out a box for every week he had already lived. Looking at life this way really helped me to put my worries into perspective and become more motivated to make a success out of my life and stop wasting time. 

I sent a picture of the print to a few friends, and asked their thoughts on it. I understood that it may make some people feel a little uncomfortable reflecting upon their mortality in this way but the feedback I got was much worse than I could have imagined. One friend was very kind about it but said that she had 'Thatnotophohia' which after I googled it means she has a severe phobia of death. I felt pretty bad about this and apologised immediately. Had I known that she had this phobia, I wouldnt have sent it. 

I spoke about the situation with another friend who called me an asshole for sending it to her, and to my other friend who has Thatnotophobia. 

I think I may be the asshole because I didnt really think that it could have such a negative effect on some people and maybe I should have. I think that maybe I'm not the asshole because everybody is aware that they will die someday, and I did ask the question with genuine intentions.

1023,NAH,AITA for telling my friends I was pregnant before my husband?,"My husband and I have been together for 3 years and have been trying for a baby for 2 years with no success. I’ve never gotten a single positive pregnancy test. After a year of trying we went to the doctor and they said my eggs were of low quality. We’ve been considering IVF but it’s very expensive of course. This has been really hard on us but we've been trying to make the best of it. I hadn’t taking a pregnancy test in about 3 months.  

I was hanging out with a group of my close friends at my best friend’s house. Kind of a girl’s night thing we do. I was complaining that I  was feeling noxious and tired. My best friend pulled me aside and asked if it was possible if I was pregnant.  I said probably not but I admitted I hadn’t taken a pregnancy test in a while. She insisted I take a pregnancy test since people were drinking at our gathering and although I didn’t really want to she had a bunch of extra tests at her place so I took one. It was shockingly positive. Obviously I was super excited because I have never gotten a positive test in my life. I took another one right away that showed how many weeks along you were and it said I was over 3 weeks pregnant. I was just in a state of shock and basically crying and all my closest friends were at her house and there was no way I could keep silent so I ended up telling everyone at the gathering. Everyone was super happy for me and we spent most of the night talking about my pregnancy. I didn’t call my husband right away because I wanted to tell him to his face and he was on a short business trip so he wouldn’t be back until the next day. However, I did tell him that I have a surprise for him when he get home. 

So as soon as he got home from his business trip I told him I was pregnant. He was ecstatic and we celebrated for about 10 minutes but then he asked me how many people knew and I told him all the girls who I was with knew and he became angry. He said it was weird that 12 people who I’m not related to knew before he did and I should have told him first and then was angry I waited a day to tell him.  I was a little put off by how angry he was as I felt he was taking away from a joyous moment for no reason. Ideally he would have been the first to know but it didn’t work out that way. He said that I should have called him immediately instead of waiting a day and should not told the other people at the party. I find this a bit ridiculous. He then got angry because I wouldn’t apologize but I honestly don’t think I did anything wrong. He thinks this is an example of how I put my friends over him.

1024,NAH,WIBTA if I “ruined” my grandmother’s ring?,"First timer here. 

My grandmother passed away and left me one of her rings. It is really not my style so I don’t wear it. I thought about bringing it to a jeweler to see if it can be made into another piece of jewelry so I can use it rather than have it sit in my jewelry box. 

When I mentioned to my mother (this was her mom’s ring), she got upset that I would “ruin” the ring she left me vs just wearing it. She wasn’t mean about it but was clearly upset at the thought.

I love my grandmother and mother dearly and don’t want to disrespect her and I’m really torn. WIBTA if I had it made into another piece of jewelry I would wear a lot? Or should I just get over it and leave it as is?

Edit: if it matters, this was not an heirloom beyond being owned by my grandmother (my grandfather bought it for her for an anniversary; it’s not a ring with a long family history)",2020-11-21 14:10:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jybcej/wibta_if_i_ruined_my_grandmothers_ring/,25,14,1.0,0
1025,NAH,WIBTA if I left my apartment vacant for 1 year whilst people are homeless?,"I’m really battling here. I own a flat in London  - there are stipulations attached that mean I can’t rent the property out (even for cheaper than I’m paying the mortgage on).

I’ve recently split up with my boyfriend and want to move to a different country in the new year & rent a flat share whilst I’m out there.  Due to the caveats involved with my mortgage (no subletting), it would mean I’d be leaving my apartment vacant for at least a year whilst I’m enjoying my time abroad. The fact that there’s people out there on the streets whilst there are millions of empty properties make my stomach churn. 

So tell me - if I were to contribute to this; would I be the asshole?",2020-11-13 19:33:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jtmilz/wibta_if_i_left_my_apartment_vacant_for_1_year/,29,30,0.88,0
