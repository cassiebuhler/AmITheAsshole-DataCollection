http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/2r3w2n/children_beating_a_gay_rights_activist_protesting/cnchjjs?context=3

The way I see it, I just pointed out that I'm glad somebody put context around a picture that could have had a very misleading title, but didn't.  The other guy seems to have reacted as if I'm denying that gay bashing has ever happened.  Am I wrong about this?

1,not the asshole,AITA for opening the door to the house while cat sitting,"A friend asked me to cat-sit when they went on vacation. Just feed them and scoop the litter every day. The cats were in the garage (as it was only a week and they would pee everywhere) and so were all their cat supplies. After I finished scooping the litter, I went inside to wash my hands. The house starts beeping and the alarm goes off. A policeman arrives and we get the situation sorted and everything is all good. 

However, once I told them, they got super mad because it was a $100~ fine or something. They want me to pay it. 

They had not mentioned the house alarm once, and they have admitted that. However, they believe that I should ""own up to my mistake"" and pay them back. 

EDIT: thanks guys, I'll stand my ground

2,not the asshole,AITA for not wanting to pay for this camera?,"I was at a party last week, and it was around ~2am. By that point, I'm near the edge of too-drunk and I wandered into the living room of this house. This girl, who I'd just met that night, hands me a camera and motions for me to take a photo of her and her friends. I managed to drop it seconds after I move it up to take the photo. We both inspect the camera, and it turns out that the flash wasn't working. I apologize profusely. The next day she adds me on Facebook and asks me to pay for the repairs since it turns out this was a $400 camera. The guy at the shop told her it'd cost $175. I tell her I'm pretty broke, but I can spare at least $100. She tells me that it's my fault it's broken, and that I need to pay for* the entire thing.

I'm going to call around to see if I can't find a place that will do it for cheaper, but I'll probably just end up putting it on my credit card. 

I feel that you shouldn't be giving expensive shit to drunk people, and that she should be taking at least some of the responsibility here. Am I an asshole for thinking that?

----------------------------------------------

Okay, thanks everyone. I'll probably still pay for the repairs myself, but It's good to know that I'm not completely in the wrong here.",2015-02-10 05:53:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2ve2ox/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_for_this_camera/,2ve2ox,13,18,0.9,0
3,everyone sucks,AITA in this situation?,"So this happened recently.

A friend/acquaintance/friend-of-a-friend/someone I know/not sure of the relationship and I got in fight. During this, we both said some things that we shouldn't have, and I for one regret it. I'm definitely the asshole in that right.

However, since then I've tried everything I can to make it right, I've apologised 30+ times in the last fortnight, saying I'm sorry, I was wrong, I'm an asshole, what can I do to make it up to you?, but they just continue to ignore me. I wish to make this right, especially for the sake of a joint good friend but they just refuse to talk. Then yesterday she messaged me for help with her studies, I gave it to her but after that she went back to ignoring me.

I feel like the asshole, but I also I feel that I shouldn't let her make me feel guilty because I tried to fix things and she's being stubborn.

I'm autistic and clinical depressed, I'm not trying to make excuses, but sometimes I say things without thinking of the consequences.

Mainly because I can't participate.,The place I work at is having a biggest loser competition and the winner gets a gift card or money or something.  What pisses me off about this is that I cannot participate because I don't have unhealthy eating habits.  I think that they should have some other sort of competition that everyone has a chance to participate in.  I guess I should be happy that I'm healthy but it's bullshit.

5,not the asshole,AITA for telling the person on the phone that my dad was asleep?,"When this happened my dad had been in his room, lying in bed for over an hour. When the phone rang my mom couldn't answer it my brother was whining, general chaos around the house. My dad yelled from his room ""someone get the phone"" which I thought was weird since he always has the phone with him. Anyway I answered it and it was my uncle asking for my dad. I said I thought he was asleep and offered to check to which he replied that it was ok and he would call later.

Detail: the phone is a landline phone so I couldn't leave my room while talking.

So, when I got out of the room my dad (still in his room with the lights off) asked me who was on the phone and when I told him he got really angry because apparently he was awake and I should have known that since he talked to me (refering to the yelling for someone to get the phone which he would have also done if he had been awakened by the phone). 

So, am I the asshole here?",2015-04-19 11:35:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3349dq/aita_for_telling_the_person_on_the_phone_that_my/,3349dq,5,7,0.9,0
6,not the asshole,AITA for being mad at my friend for not paying me back?,"I have a friend who will often buy me food. Not because I ask, just as a favor if we are somewhere together and hungry and I don't have money. She often has more money than me and has always made it a point to say that her paying is friendly favor and I don't owe her. Last week, we were going to go to the movies, and we were each planning to pay for our tickets. When we got there, she had forgotten her wallet, and told me if I paid for her ticket, she would pay me back the next day. A few days later I asked if she could give me the 10 dollars because I needed it for bus fare, and she told me she realized afterwards she shouldn't have to pay me because she had bought me things in the past adding up to much more than $10.

Am I an asshole for being angry at her? I understand her point that she had paid for me before, but I was never told that she expected me to pay her back. $10 is not a lot of money, but I still feel like she doesn't have the right to say she won't pay me back after I paid for her under the pretenses she would.",2015-05-19 19:16:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/36j12o/aita_for_being_mad_at_my_friend_for_not_paying_me/,36j12o,11,11,0.93,0

 Anyways, there is this one girl, you know, the one everybody tries to like, but most of the time secretly dislikes? Yeah, her. Well, she always annoys me. Normally it doesn't bother me but today it was like having someone play the recorder in your ear while popping water ballons filled with vinegar on your head. I told her, politely, to please leave me alone, that i wasn't having a good day, but she laughed in my face and continued to annoy me further. And then i exploded. I got in her face and used the full extent of my colorful language at her until i finally just threw my hands up and walked away, leaving her there, shocked. When i came back to my senses later, i felt incredibly guilty. I texted her an apology and explanation (bad day, too much stress and whatnot) but she still hasn't responded.  I tried calling and it went right to voicemail. So to settle my conscience, tell me. Am i the asshole?

9,not the asshole,AITA for forgetting to say thank you when someone held the door open for me.,"So a while ago I was in my school show, and it had just ended. I walked home with my friend who does not go to my school, with whom I rarely get the chance to speak, and we hit up a really intense conversation. As we left the building, a woman held the door open for us, but deep in conversation, we didn't really take notice. When we get out of the building the woman stops out conversation, smiles at us and says to us ""You know when someone holds the door open for you, you say thank you,"" as if we're in first grade. We apologized and said thank you, and that was the end of the exchange. I understand I should've said thank you in that situation, but was her rudeness necessary in this case?

10,asshole,AITA for not wanting a relationship with my father,"So I am 17 years old and 2 months away from moving to college and basically starting my own life. Ever since I was little, I have never gotten along with my dad. We don't have the same interests, the only time we speak is if something needs to be done or if a question needs to be answered, and just never really spent time together as I was growing up unless we were forced to (family vacation, ect). We do not casually chat or have deep conversations, the only time I can think of an instance like this was when I was checked into rehab for suicidal threats where we both broke down and promised to try and fix our relationship but that didn't hold up even a week after I got out. We would always argue and disagree until it got to the point that we just started ignoring each other even when we were in the same room. I can count on my hand the amount of texts I have ever sent my dad. Since I recently graduated and my younger brother just turned 16, my dad said that he would get me a new car and pass down mine to my brother. When we were having lunch (silently) after looking at some used cars, we got into an argument that lead to screaming. He got frustrated that I would be so rude as to raise my voice when he does all these nice things for me like pay for my college and buy me a car. I am thankful for these things but afterwords he asked me if I even wanted to have a relationship with him. I honestly didn't know what to say because I knew that I do not want to have a functioning relationship with him like I do with my mother, but he said that it makes him sad because he wants to have a relationship with me more than anything. When I got home I got into my room and burst into tears because of how bad I felt for not wanting a relationship but deep down I know that the emotional scars and 17 years of disconnect has really fucked me up to a certain extent but he doesn't know as I rarely spend time with him.

12,not the asshole,AITA Not attending my cousin's wedding?,"A little bit of backstory here. 

I come from a very large, blended family. I have more cousins than I can count, and as a result unfortunately many of us generally close in age have formed ""cliques"" in a way. It's not that I dislike my family, just that I have a whole lot of it and there are only so many hours in the week. 

So around July last year my cousin tells me at a gathering she's getting married, and that she isn't sure if she will be able to invite everyone, because like I said before, huge family. I tell her just let me know and congratulations. 

Fast forward to a couple months ago and I get my invitation. I notified her that I wouldn't be attending. Now I won't be going because of the following:

1. I work a lot. Like, as in 6 days a week, usually 55-60 hours at the least. I work the day of her wedding and it's a long hike from work. 
2. I wasn't given a guest +1 for the event, despite the fact that my girlfriend and I have been seeing each other as long as she's been seeing this guy. (Not that she moved fast or anything.)
3. My previously mentioned girlfriend works in the airline industry and I haven't seen her in about 10 days. She'll be flying back in on the evening of the wedding (which again she wasn't invited to.)
4. Her and I have never been particularly close. We're friends on Facebook and all but I don't even have her number. She's from one of the other ""cliques,"" I suppose. When she notified me I wouldn't be receiving a guest for the reception, she did so via Facebook message. 
5. Her mom, who is my aunt, have a lot of bad blood. Long story I won't get into here. 

So as soon as my mom and dad find out about the whole ordeal of me not going I'm an asshole and this is the reason us cousins aren't close, and blah blah blah. 

I'm not going either way, I just wanted this subs input. ",2015-06-13 03:40:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/39o2h3/aita_not_attending_my_cousins_wedding/,39o2h3,10,12,0.93,0

14,asshole,AITA for not wanting to cover a coworkers shift,"I'm pretty confident I'm not but what's got me here is the reaction of other people I work with.

Our story begins during dinner. I get a text from a coworker asking if I can cover their shift tomorrow because they have a job interview. Normally this wouldn't be a problem but I had plans and it's my only day off for the week. I text her back saying I'd really rather not do it because I have plans and ask her to try someone else. 
After a brief time she says no one else can do it. I check the roster and discover she has Friday off so I reply to her saying ""I'll have to cancel my plans to do this and I'm not very happy about you just assuming I'd do this for you when you're free the very next day."" 


Anytime I've had an interview or whatever else I've always made sure to schedule it for a day off because my job is my responsibility to take care of, right? I've never had an interviewer have a problem with this.

So she texts me back acting like I'm the asshole in this situation. I was pretty confused by this so I ran it past a couple of my other coworkers and they both pretty much said ""Why didn't you just do it?""

I mean like... How am I the dick here?

And just as a little bit of icing on the cake. I'm driving my mother to the airport on friday morning before work. It's gonna take about 3 and a half hours there and back and I'm still showing up for my 9am start.

15,not the asshole,AITA for ending a friendship?,"Ok, so last year I ended a friendship with a longtime friend, and she seems to be wanting to move past it, but I am feeling like I don't want to, am I being an asshole?


The backstory is that we were in a friend group in high school that hung out together all the time, and at the base of that group were four girls, including me.  I was extremely close with the one (we'll call her Kay), and good friends with the other two (we'll call them Ali and Jess).  Ali is the friend I'm talking about now.  After we graduated we all went off to colleges in different states and slowly grew apart.  Jess dropped off the face of the earth completely, and I vaguely kept in email contact with Kay and Ali.  Ali dropped out and moved back home, but she worked really hard and has an awesome job, so she's been doing well.  I never thought I'd move back even remotely close to where I grew up, but I ended up going to graduate school about 2 hours away from where I grew up, and I reconnected with Ali.  We grew up in a small town, so she always wanted to come visit me to come to the big city, and I would visit her occasionally, but not nearly as often as she would come to see me.  Typically her visits involved her going to some event, like a concert or sporting event and she would crash at my place.


So the start of the fall out started a few years ago when I was diagnosed with cancer.  I was really sick and in the hospital and I talked to her about visiting, she said she was slammed at work and couldn't make it, but she sent a card and a gift.  No big deal, I totally understood.  Fast forward about six months, she came into town to visit, I was on the mend.  We go out to lunch and I was telling her how hard everything had been, she says now that I've opened up she should as well.  That she had been lying about being single for all these years, and that she'd actually had a boyfriend for about two years.  She said the reason she hadn't told me was because it was scandalous, and I was thinking maybe he was married or something.  Then she tells me its because he's black.  I found this really offensive, because I could care less about that, and if she knew me at all she would know that.  I brought up that Jess is black and dated white guys and none of us thought anything of that, so why would this be any different.  She was like oh well I just didn't know if you were racist or not.  So I was already mad, but then she tells me that she's been coming to town about every week with him to go to events and stuff, but never told me because she didn't want me to know about him.  So she didn't come visit me when I was in the hospital with cancer because she didn't want me to know about her secret black boyfriend.


The second strike is our beach trip a few months later.  We had already planned and paid for it when I found this out, so I decided to suck it up and try to make it as fun as possible.  We go out one night, I drove and was DD, she proceeds to get trashed, and cause a scene at the bar we were at.  She invited two guys back to our place even though we both have boyfriends, and I had to tell them they were not actually invited and to leave us alone, and she starts yelling at me about how I'm such a worrier and that nothing was going to happen and I'm no fun, etc etc.  I drove us back to our condo and I was pissed.  I mostly read on the beach the next day, and I didn't drive us to go back out, and then I went straight home.  


Strike three for me was kinda two things together, but they were similar.  The first was her coming to visit to go to something during the day and wanted me to go with her, I told her I had to work and couldn't.  I worked all day and then went out that night, and she thought this was rude because I said I couldn't hang out.  Then I was supposed to see her before Thanksgiving and ended up having to work, I warned her a week in advance that I wouldn't be able to make it, and she told me to text her the day of to confirm.  I said ok, but then I forgot, because I was focused on work, and at 4pm she texted me and said ""I guess you're not coming"" I told her that I had already let her know and was going to text her when I got home.  I apologized and said that maybe I didn't come across clear, but that I thought I had let her know.  She said that our friendship doesn't seem like a priority to me and that I'm a shitty friend.  So I told her if that's how she feels then great, but I don't care because I'm done being friends with someone who treats me the way that she does.  I haven't talked to her again since.


Recently, she has been emailing saying she misses me and wants to move past everything and be friends again.  I don't have any interest in trying to work through that with her, and I'd rather her not be in my life.  Am I being the asshole?  Should I try to work things out?  Was I wrong?  Thanks!





TL;DR; My longtime friend didn't visit me when I had cancer because she didn't want me to know about her secret black boyfriend because she didn't know if I was racist (I'm not), she was a drunken rude mess on our beach trip, and told me I'm a shitty friend for having to cancel on her because of work, am I the asshole for ending our friendship and not wanting to mend it?",2015-06-26 19:10:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3b85d3/aita_for_ending_a_friendship/,3b85d3,17,15,0.83,0

17,asshole,Am I the asshole for asking my parents to pay me back when I buy them things?,"So, I'm 19 and still live with my parents. I have a part time job averaging about 25 hours a week at minimum wage. My parents will ask me occassionally(as im sure all parents do) to pick up milk or some groceries from the store. I don't mind the chore, I like getting out and driving and walking around. However, what I do mind, is when I give them the receipt from my trip, which contains all THEY wanted(if I get anything for me, I do it on a seperate transaction as to not add confusion to the bill). Then, when I ask to be paid for it, my mother gets up in arms over asking for my money back. She uses arguments like, ""Oh well, I buy you things when im at the store and I don't ask you to pay me"" or ""When I was your age, Id buy my moms stuff because I loved my mommy so much."", which to me doesn't make sense seeming how I pick up what I need or ask if they want me to pay them for any groceries I put on the list. The thing is, I wouldn't mind if these were just snide comments, but these turn into days long arguments over something like $11. Another factor that may play in is after my grandfather died, he left me a substantial amount of money to help pay for college, which my mother believes she was cheated out of. I already have lent her about $500 with her not paying that back yet, arguing that it shouldve been hers anyway. I feel I should mention my mom is on disability and my dad works full time. I guess, I want my money back, because I know if I don't ask in the moment, my mothers going to think that everytime she sends me to the store that Ill just cover it and end up making my lists so much longer and more expensive since I ""have the money to afford it anyway."" What do you think here?

18,not the asshole,Coworker threatened to kill me off work property - AITA?,"Hey guys, my first post, so here goes nothing:

This happened this morning, just a few minutes ago.

I was on my way to work, stopped at the convenience store on the other side of the parking lot from work, and my girlfriend (who also works with me) came with.  On our way over a coworker, we'll call her Bethany, got my girlfriend's attention and asked about trivial stuff while I paced ahead of them, not wanting to get involved.  When my GF told me to slow down because I was walking too fast, I told her (loud enough that she could hear me, about 20 feet away) that she was talking to Bethany and I ""didn't want to have anything to do with that.""  My girlfriend knows the past stuff that has gone on between Bethany and I, and knows that I do not like this person.

Anyway, I went into the convenience store and Bethany followed us in.  I think she came up to me first, came behind me while I was at the counter, and said, ""That was highly inappropriate,""  I said back, ""Well I'm not going to be rude to you at work, but outside of work...""  I believe it was then that she came up to my girlfriend and said that, ""You better tell your girl that if I ever hear my name pass her lips again, I'm going to fucking kill her.""

Now, my GF and I sat down for a little while, eating our breakfast sandwiches that we bought, and she told me that, ""Sometimes the things I say are so embarassing.""  This is when she told me that Bethany had threatened my life.

Let me give you a little back story, so you know the context.

I've been working here for about a year, and the first cubicle I was assigned to I sat immediately behind Bethany.  I knew who she was because I had seen her on the bus before (gotta love mass transit, right?) and I tried to become friends with her, since that's always my reaction to meeting new people.  She would have good days and bad days, and to be honest, my humor tends towards dry sarcasm.  Everyone else that I interract with at work gets the same, but only she seems to take it personally.  The incident that prompted her first threat against me was very mild, I thought.

We have a rule at work that cell phones are not to be out and used.  If a supervisor sees you with a cell phone then they will pass that along to your supervisor and then they will possibly take disciplinary action against you.  On this particular day, I had gotten up to use the bathroom and on my way back she startled hard, because she was on her phone and scared that it might be a Sup and not a coworker who had seen her breaking the rules. I appologized for startling her, and sat down and went back to work.  The next time it happened again.  This time, as I passed her and she freaked out, I said that maybe if she didn't have her cell phone out, she wouldn't be so startled by people walking past her.  When I sat down she said, very quietly, that she would beat me up after work.

She didn't.  But ever since that day I have actively tried to avoid being in the same place at the same time.  Obviously sometimes, like this morning, it is unavoidable.

I brought this to the attention of my union, but the entire thing still makes me think that I may have somehow overreacted when I said, within earshot of Bethany, that I didn't want to have anything to do with her.  Should I have been more meek about this?

TL;DR: Coworker that has a history of threatening me took it to the max this morning when she told my girlfriend (who was with me) that she would ""fucking kill me"".  This was right after I had said to my girlfriend (within earshot of this coworker) that I didn't want to have anything to do with the conversation she and this coworker were having together.

19,not the asshole,AITA for telling some stranger to stop beating the shit out his kid in the grocery store?,"This was the scenario:

I'm shopping, rolling my cart down the aisle, when suddenly a little boy  (I'm guessing around 3 or 4 years old) jumps in front of my cart and playfully yells:  ""Get outta my way!!""  I laughed.

Suddenly, his Dad  (I guess) comes storming around the corner and beats the living hell out of this kid.  It was more than just a Dad-like spanking like I used to get when I was his age...but it was a spanking - not like the guy punched him or anything.  ""You do NOT talk to your elders that way!!""

I was shocked for a moment but then said, ""Dude!  Is that really necessary?!""  He says, ""Mind yer own goddamn business.""  His Mom then gives the kid a screaming at.  Everyone else was just walking by this situation not paying any mind.  I went about my shopping.  But that really pissed me off.

Should I have just turned the other way?  I guess I have no right to tell him how to parent.  But fuck.  Am I the asshole?

EDIT:  More information regarding said spanking have been requested.  As I mentioned previously, this is not what I would call a ""swat"".  The Dad was a huge guy - judging from his tats, appeared to be a former  (or current)  Marine.  By ""huge"", I mean ""hits the gym daily"" huge...not overweight.  The child was...meh...about the average size for a 4 year old, I would say.  The spanking itself was a ""rear back and SPANK...HARD.""  I'm not the biggest guy  (I weigh about a buck 40, would be considered thin) - but let's just say that if this guy hit ME with that much force, it would have hurt ME.  I recall my Dad spanking me as a child and I certainly had a sore bottom afterward but I don't see this kid sitting down tonight.  People, it was bad.

20,asshole,AITA for not helping out my dad and brother when i was busy?,"So, today I am going camping. I am getting picked up in two hours, and in that time, i have to shower/get dressed/shit/shave etc, pack, and get my gear together. My family knows this. I came home from staying at my friends house the night before at noon. I made something to eat and took a nap at 1, and just woke up at 3. My dad calls me and says my brother forgot his jersey or something, and he needs me to bring it to the field. I told him i don't really have time, because I'm getting ready for camping, and I am getting picked up and don't want to cause a delay. He gets quite mad and says something like, ""you know, i'll remember this."" Now i'm just confused. Should i just find the damn jersey and bring it up there? Am i the asshole for not having time?


Update: Ended up feeling like a dick, so i went and found the jersey, and drove it up to the field. Dad thanked me, i went home and got ready.

21,asshole,AITA for being candid about something related to my former work where my former boss could see?,"Sorry, this is kind of serious and possibly boring...but I genuinely want to know if I made an asshole move.   Husband says yes I should have known better.   

I used to work at a nonprofit that does work in India, and quit recently because they needed more time than I could give.  I recently read ""Beyond the Beautiful Forevers,"" which is about life an a slum in Mumbai and a lot about the corruption in India.  There is a part about the people in the slums using corrupt methods to get money from Western charities and use it for different purposes.  According to this book, and in fact some of our experience doing business in India, bribes and corruption aren't just part of the fabric of the culture and economy there - they ARE the culture and economy, and it made me really question whether charity work can be done *at all* in the way we try to do it from the US.  

So I posted about it on FB (in a general sense, not mentioning my former job although everyone knows what it was and why the topic was interesting to me).  Someone asked specifically about my former org, and I responded ""I have no idea...I have met the staff from India and they seem professional and like they are doing a good job, and we have checks and balances and good governance in place because we do have experience with corruption in India, but if EVERYONE is in cahoots, as it seems they are from this book, then there's no real way to know, is there?""    I was being honest.  I wasn't a marketing person, don't do spin, and I was mostly just reacting to this very disturbing book in what I consider a somewhat personal, not professional venue.    There were a lot of serious responses, including one from a friend who does mission work in Kenya, agreeing about the difficulty of working in a corrupt country where you really can't tell.

So my former boss responds to that thread,  asking if I'm doing drugs or drinking a lot in a really nasty, confrontational way, and I responded to her, all earnest, saying that the book was really disturbing and it was making me think a lot and reframe in my mind stuff that I thought was one way, but that could have been completely different...and she called me and yelled that I was saying to the whole world that everything she had been working on and for for the last 6 years was a lie.  I tried to respond that no, I wasn't saying that *at all* but she was too pissed and hung up on me after saying some really nasty stuff.  I tried to apologize and ended up deleting the entire post but I feel like shit.  

I don't use Facebook for professional stuff *at all,* even though they tried for years to make us post their marketing campaigns and solicit for donations through our personal social media.  To ME, Facebook is a place to share thoughts, books, have conversations (light and heavy) and I was using it that way.  Was I an asshole or just should have known better or was that fine and she overreacted because I hit a nerve?  AITA?  

EDIT:  Thanks guys, I ended up deleting the post and posting an apology/explanation, saying that I didn't intend to question our staff or organization.  My former boss emailed and thanked me for that and we're all good.

22,not the asshole,AITA for wanting to be liked?,"My friend of 3 years hasn't been speaking to me a lot lately. I've been trying to keep in touch and hang out but gotten almost no response. Finally today, after a comment thread on FB with other people as well, he tells me we can't hang out one on one bc he's a guy and I'm a girl and he doesn't want to hurt his new girlfriend. He says it in a condescending way that implies he doesn't want to see me at all any more so I replied a little snarkily that I had been wanting to hang out in a group and that if he didn't want to be friends any more I would have appreciated prior notice before he started acting like this and ignoring my texts. I thought he was just being a little rude and it would blow over in five minutes. Then he proceeded to tell me that in fact he didn't want to be friends any more because I'm a bad influence on him. He says I am a flirt and that I enjoy the social influence that buys me. He also says I am manipulative and play mind games with people and have hurt a lot of my friends, and that it feels like I've been trying to keep him and his girlfriend apart.

He gave me no specific examples of who I had hurt or what I had specifically said. I have been told that I come across as a flirt before, but my personality is just to be friendly with people and joke around and tease them-- I'm not being touchy-feely with them, or complimenting their appearance, or anything like that, just trying to be friendly and banter. But nobody except him has accused me of doing that on purpose to have more power over people or to hurt them. As for his relationship, I've let him literally cry on my shoulder about this girl. I've suggested before when they were broken up that maybe he should move on but told him that it was his decision to make and that I would support him no matter what.

I will admit that I do work really hard to try and be a charming and well-liked person. I have tried to become better friends with ""cool"" people because I'm tired of being seen as a super weird girl and a loser. I don't think that I'm better than other people who are nerdy and stuff-- I freely admit I'm a huge nerd and most of my friends are as well. And those are the people I still spend the vast majority of my time with. I just really want to be liked, and honestly sometimes it feels like a break to be away from some of my friends who attract attention with their awkwardness. I know it's shallow of me. Sometimes when I do nice things I don't do them just because I want to be helpful, but because I want a better relationship with the person or because I want to be a good person and want to be known for that.

And I'm really afraid that that makes me a manipulator, or that I really am hurting everybody I know all the time and they just don't tell me. I have been confronted before when I have done something specific to someone and immediately apologized and worked to fix things, but it has not been for anything this guy is talking about. I asked other friends about this situation and they all said that no, I'm not manipulative and that this guy is being mean, but I really just want an outside perspective. I'm losing our entire friendship over this until he decides I'm a better person (yes, he said that). We have the same friend groups, we're on the same quiz team, and we're in the same social club, so all of this is going to be messy and awkward and I don't know what to do now. Am I the asshole or is he?

TL;DR I thought I was being friendly and dealing with my mistakes when they happened. Friend says I'm a manipulator and a bad influence who hurts everyone.

26,not the asshole,Roommate moved his girlfriend and dog in for a month and his outraged when I asked to split the rent 3 ways.,"*edit- Was supposed to read, ""is outraged"" in title.

I'm in a 2 bedroom apartment with a roommate. Our lease is up in 2 days and his plan was to move out and find a place with his girlfriend. My plan was to move out and find another roommate. Last week he sends me a text saying he's staying another month. This is ok for me since I hadn't nailed down a new roommate or place yet either. 

Monday night (2 days ago) I come home from work to find our place chock full of moving boxes and new furniture. His girlfriend, who got evicted from her other place, is suddenly here living his room with the rest of her stuff strewn out throughout the apartment. AND her dog. He didn't tell me because he, ""didn't think I'd care.""

Today, nearing the end of the month, I wanted to confirm we're splitting the rent 3 ways. They can both afford it; she's actually the one with the job in the relationship (he has GI bill military income each month). He told me there was no way in hell that was happening because she's his guest and not a tenant. I surveyed the massive piles of boxes and gestured but that only set him off further. Anyway, apparently that's the end of the discussion. 

Am I the asshole here?

----

Update - She just got home and said the same thing he did. Visit to the leasing office first thing tomorrow.

----

Update 2, 7/30/15 10:50am

I asked the leasing office to please send me a copy of the contract as they weren't open yet this morning when the stopped by. The lovely lady very quickly accommodated and sent over the fine print. I mucked through the legalese and found these two exciting clauses:

""**34. PETS:** No pets are permitted without the prior written consent of the Landlord. Any such consent may be revoked at any time, with or without cause, by giving ten (10) days written notice. Except to the extent written permission is given, pets may not be brought upon the Premises, whether such pets belong to Resident(s) or to any other person. **The presence of any pets as to which written permission has not been given and is not currently in force, even if such pets are ""just visiting"", shall be deemed a material and incurable breach of this Lease and shall be cause for the service of a three-day notice terminating the tenancy.** This policy does not apply to service animals.""

""**Visitors**

Tenant acknowledges that his guests are his responsibility that they will park in only designated parking areas and that they will adhere to all the apartment rules. Visitors are limited to a 5 days day stay. Visitors staying longer than 5 days days must notify Management in writing.""

Checkmate.

----

Update 3, 7/30/15 4:00pm

Roommate obviously noticed the signs of me packing up and asked if I was moving out. I said I had nothing to say to him. I plan on talking to the leasing people tomorrow. He came back an hour later and said, ""Just so you know, if you don't pay August rent I will sue you in Small Claims Court.""

I told him to have a nice day.

----

Update 4, 7/30/15 11:48pm

I have completely moved out. The leasing people, who I talked with for an hour, were *exceedingly* unhelpful. If I ever want to be able to legally move out of there I have to have him co-sign a ""roommate separation agreement"" and he. will. not. sign. it.

They tell me that I wouldn't even be able to be eligible to get my deposit back until both of us move out. I asked what that meant if he stayed there for 5 years and the woman shrugged at me. They say also that anything that is problematic with the apartment while she's there is my responsibility too because my name is on the lease. ""You're telling me that my roommate brings an uninvited guest and her dog against my wishes, I report it, and I'll get in trouble for having an unauthorized pet?""

""Your name is on the lease."" the woman said and stared blankly.

Later, in an unfortunate fit of rage while loading/packing, her stupid dog walked past me in the hallway while the front door was open because I was carrying things. I yelled, ""GET OUT!"" at it. 

Looking worried it ran outside and she chased it. I closed the door and locked it. Not like she has a key. Anyway he threatened to call the cops. I told him go ahead, but he backed down. After talking with my parents they suggested, ""Oh why don't you talk to dear family friend, the attorney who specializes in real estate whose husband is a realtor and they are our neighbors and you practically were an older brother to their daughter?""

*facepalm because I completely forgot about that wonderful woman* ""Yes, please, dad. Would you please call her and ask if it's ok for me to get her advice?""

He sent off a voicemail and an email. Hopefully I will get in touch tomorrow. I am exhausted and going to bed.

----

**FINAL UPDATE** 8/3/15  6:53pm PST

On Friday I wrote a formal letter and sent it to the leasing office and CCed the roommate stating I had moved out, new person had moved in with dog, I wish to give notice, he wont let me off lease, etc. I also stated I would be pursuing small claims court action. I did.  Then I went to the local small claims court and submitted California SC-100 form for 3 months rent, my deposit, and an extra $1000 for potential pet damages against the roommate. 3 months is because court dates can take a while and if I wasn't allowed off the lease I would have to be compensated. I had no expectation of getting this money; what I wanted was to be able to walk away free and clear. That was the alternative I planned to present to him.

I received a text on Friday evening from the roommate that I had been released from the lease. I know he had not received the paperwork yet, so this was likely a response to the text I sent him that said, ""hey I need you to pay me $4200"" as required by law (I have to ask for it before taking legal action). The leasing company made it clear I still had to give 30 days notice so today being the 3rd I had to visit the office and pay my half of the $1875 rent so I could walk away. I was prepared for that outcome.

I asked for my copy of the release form he signed and then inquired about the rent I had to pay. Apparently he added his girlfriend and her dog to the lease. She is on the lease. Their names are on the lease. ""Wait,"" I said, ""does this mean I don't have to pay for August?""

In true bureaucratic form they answered, ""Your name is not on the lease.""

I blinked and stared. ""I'm... free?""

""Your name is not on the lease.""

""Can I get that in writing?"" I inquired, starting to feel a twinge of hope.

""That's what this release form is. It was signed on the 31st. You claim to have moved out. Your name is not on the lease.""

""Would you like my keys?"" I asked

""We can take them or you can give them to your old roommate.""

""Thanks I'd like to never see him again. Here is the door key and here is the postal box key. You have been wonderful. Goodbye""

Then I left. I am now on my 3rd beer and happy as a clam. I will call off the lawsuit ASAP. They are paying the full rent for August and the foreseeable future.

27,not the asshole,AITA For wanting her to be with me and not him,"First I want to list the people that are involved in this situation. First off there's the main girl we'll call her M (I will also refer to M and ""her"") then there is the guy we'll call him D(I will also refer to D as ""him""), there is another girl that I had a thing with we'll call her H, my ex is also apart of this story we'll call her S, and of course me. We are all in high school although D is a grade higher than me and M. M and I have been friends for about 6 months now and I have grown to like her a lot. We have similar personalities and have gone through a lot of the same shit in life, making it very easy for her and I to sympathize with each other on most everything.

In the beginning of our friendship I was talking to and pursuing H, I had no idea that M might like me at all. Eventually the thing with H fell through. After it fell through I had a conversation with M, where I learned that M liked me before she knew I had a thing with H, she then told me that she no longer liked me and had moved on. After this I started dating S and M started to have a thing with D, I was happy in my relationship and I was happy for her.

Long story short I broke up with S and decided that I was done with relationships for awhile. I was still happy for M and D they never officially started dating but they were happy together and what did I care. As school ended and summer began M and I were talking and Skyping a lot, during these conversations we grew very close. I learned that her best friend and her were having a fight and weren't really talking. So in away I became her person she talk to. 

In the middle of summer M and D hadn't gone on a signal date or seen each other, the last time they had seen each other was the last day of school. M had told me that she wasn't really interested in dating D and only wanted to be good friends with D but didn't want to push D away so she said nothing to him about being just friends. So at this point I thought that they weren't dating and that she didn't like him. One day we were texting and she mentioned that she had just had an amazing day with D at a local theme park, I guess this ""date"" had changed her feelings for him. I started to ask questions about her day and what it was like. What I found out is that M and D aren't officially ""dating"" but they have a ""thing"" whatever that means. 

The next day we were Skyping and I told her that I liked her and that I have feelings for her, M told me that she likes me as well but she also likes D at the same time, she said that she knows that its a bad thing to feel and that it wasn't fair to either me or D. We continue our conversation like nothing happened. In other Skype conversations I tried to bring up the whole topic of her liking me and D, but most of the time she would avoid the question or talk about something else. The one time that I did get her to talk about it was when she listed the pros and cons of both me and D. Both me and D had about the same Pros (She says that we're very similar, I don't know him to well), my one con was that I wasn't in her friend group and D's one con was that he was a year older than her. Neither of these cons being that bad.

Moving this long story up to just a few days ago. While I was texting her she seemed kinda out of it and wasn't really in the conversation, if that makes any sense. Anyways I asked her what was on her mind and she replied with a wall of text. This wall of text basically said that M was feeling pathetic because she can't face anything coming towards her (I'm assuming she meant the situation with me and D) M also said that I really likes D but he tries to fix everything and be her shrink but all she wants him to do is to listen but she doesn't think he capable of just listening. She went on and said ""And you, oh you are just, basically perfect, and that's actually really annoying because I want to just like D and be done with it but I can't because when I talk to you it reminds me of what he isn't. And I hate that. I really don't like it. But it's there. And I don't know what to do with it. And I feel awful for feeling that, because it's not fair to either of you."" Honestly, I don't know what to take from this part of the text, but now you're caught up to present day, My question is am I the asshole For wanting her to be with me and just go up to her and ask her to be my girlfriend and not be with D ?  Feed back and questions are welcome.

TLDR: She likes him and me and has told me this, I like her ( I have told her this) and want her to be with me and not him.

28,asshole,AITA for lashing out at my friend earlier.,"I have this friend who lives in my neighborhood. We will call him, Dom. We've been friends for about 7 years now so we're pretty close. 
He has a habit of coming to my house at points even if I state that I don't want company at the moment. This goes on a lot and I just usually reject him at the door or let him in.

Today I acted a bit different though. He had told me the previous day that he'd come to my house the next day. I didn't specify whether that'd be okay or not. The next day he came over, I wasnt feeling too hot so I just didn't answer the door. Not too long after I decide to go outside and he's sitting on my front porch waiting for me to come out or something. I brought out a little water gun cause he wouldn't leave and got him with it a few times **(this was more playful than anything no one was angry or upset).**

After a bit he actually leaves.

He then waits till my parents come home and then proceeds to try to walk in my house because they both like him. I heard the front door open and I realize who it was coming in the house. This pissed me off. I proceeded to walk out of my room, stop him before he actually walks to far in my house and just yell **""I told you no, Dom. Go away, get out!""**

A bit of awkward silence cause I'm not known to yell at people. Anyways after he walks out my parents and I have a bit of talk.

After some thinking I actually feel kind of bad about it and I'm not sure if I was just an asshole then.

So reddit, am I the asshole?

A (short-tempered) apology (with several comments on my ultimate responsibility in the matter), no matter how sincere, was not my ultimate  aim. Because right now it seems to me that tempers on either end could spark up at this point, and then we'd all have to enjoy that awkward nightmare.

So I'm going to stay here tonight. We'll pick up game night on better terms.

Me: It may be a surprise to note that I was quite on edge yesterday as well, and I wouldn't have trusted my own temperment had I not already made plans before I found myself in that situation. I am not going to tempt fate on that matter now.

Terry: It was very clear that you didn't have your heart set on hanging out yesterday

Me: Yes, it occurred in the intevening time between 6 and 6:30, hence our lateness

Me: and [my girlfriend]'s absence

Terry: That was my assumption too, but it's not really my business

Me: It was Jacob's assumption, and he did consider his business to the extent that he wanted to confirm it.

Me: That's neither here nor there

Terry: also, this isn't ""A mood"" that I'm in, I always communicate like this. I think that people forget that when they're having a bad day because it gives them an excuse to get mad at somebody.

Terry: Have you ever seen me flip out on somebody during a game night? Can you even imagine what that would look like?

Terry: because I can't

Terry: I leave my significant grievances at the door. I only hold on to the petty, comedy-inducing ones.

Terry: so if you think that you're gonna have fun then show up and if you don't think you're gonna have fun don't show up, but you can be sure that if I make the decision to participate, I'm gonna try to have a good time.

Me: Then let me rephrase. I consider solely myself a liability this evening and I have no intention nor desire to come. I'll extend the offer to [my girlfriend, a usual member], but I am clearly not able to enjoy the fesitivites

Me: She's not particularly interested. I'm sure that comes as no surprise, but I thought I'd at least entertain the possibility.

Me: My apologies for ruining the plans this evening",2015-08-24 02:01:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3i5ffi/aita_for_getting_too_defensive/,3i5ffi,9,2,0.58,0

31,asshole,[AITA] for wanting my landlord to get a light installed?,"I guess this post should really be titled ""would I be the asshole if..."" because I haven't actually done anything yet but I want to know how appropriate it would be.

So about a month and a half ago my landlord had a ceiling fan installed in my room. That was awesome and all, but it also involved installing a new light. 

Now as you may or may not know, you can't install a light above a fan - it would flicker and just generally be awful. So the new light is in the corner of my room, above my desk. But even in a fairly small room like mine, that leaves the opposite side of the room fairly dark most of the time. It's unpleasant and slightly depressing, is what I'm saying.

My question is simply this - would I be the asshole if I asked to have another light installed on the opposite side of the room? I'd be happy to buy the light myself and put some money towards the installation costs too, but I don't know how much would be right to offer. 

It feels like if I asked it would be like saying ""sorry, but the money and effort you spent on improving my room isn't good enough for me, I want you do *more*."" When it was first done I mentioned how dark the room was and I got the impression she thought I was being ungrateful about it - I backtracked a little and said I'd see if I got used to it, but I don't think it's going to get any better.

32,asshole,AITA for not feeling responsible for friends who drink and drive then wind up hurt.,"After a happy hour a coworker ""Sansa"" (that my buddy/coworker ""Petyr"" is crushing on) decided it was time to go and Petyr thought she might have been a little too buzzed to drive. Sansa says she felt fine. He tried his best to convince her as much as he could including getting perhaps a little too touchy, but she wasn't feeling his advice.

So after she leaves Petyr gets all butthurt about it and starts complaining about how awful she and drunk divers all are. I tell him sometimes you just gotta let people do what they do and you can't stop them. He tried, but he should leave it as that.

Then he starts talking about all the supposed victims that there might be and I just tell him that responsibility is on them and not him. He asks me if I ever knew anyone who got hurt or killed by drunk driving and I said yes but maintain that I don't consider it my responsibility beyond offering a friend a place to crash, if they feel like they need it. If they don't, I let them go.

He told me I was monster for this. We haven't spoken since. Am I really that bad? I think he's a little too controlling, but maybe I'm wrong. I mean he cares about victims of drunk driving and that's cool, but I don't know if that's just a convenient way for him to claim moral superiority?

EDIT: Since it's not clear, neither myself nor any of my coworkers got sloppy drunk. we all hung out for about 2 hours or so and had 2 or 3 drinks. Nobody was two-stepping or slurring their speech .

34,asshole,AITA for not liking my dog?,"This all started when, along with my partner, I made one of the worst decisions of my life.  And that was was to get a puppy the exact same day as I was about to begin 6 months paternity leave with our 6 month old first child.  Now, I had never been a dog owner before, or a father to a baby.  So both were new experiences to me.   I had no idea (naive maybe?) how much time, effort and attention a puppy needed.  So whilst stressed to fuck with a new baby, and on top of that a puppy that constantly needed feeding, taking out for shits/pisses, wiping up the accidents, it's safe to say that my head was going.  Fast forwards 3 years, and my son is now 3 and half years, our dog is around the same age and now we have a new baby on the way.  I find myself getting more and more annoyed with said dog.  Taking it out for the necessary walks three times a day are becoming more and more of a chore and I can't see things getting any easier when the new baby arrives.  It's got to the point where it's not that I don't have the time for the dog, it's just that most things he does annoys me. Don't get me wrong, I have my moments when I'm like, fuck man, sort your shit out.  This dog is amazing.  He's always been great with my son, has never shown any aggression and generally just does dog things.  But still, I just get annoyed at the smallest things like when he follows me around the house.   So basically Redditors, AITA for not liking my dog?",2015-10-22 17:45:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3psse3/aita_for_not_liking_my_dog/,3psse3,23,9,0.8,0
35,asshole,AITA for lying all the time?,"Hey guys,

so I know that nobody likes a liar. Neither do I. But somehow I just can't help myself - whenever a little lie is much more convenient than the truth and I know that nobody cares enough to check the facts, I lie.

Sometimes it's just that the lie is easier to explain. For example, if someone asks me why I look so tired, the answer might be that before going to bed, I spilled a huge mug of tea behind my counter and I spent half the night taking my kitchen apart and trying to soak up the moisture. But it's easier to just say ""I didn't sleep well"".

When I'm late because I spent too much time on reddit and forgot that I still had to take a shower, I will say that I took the wrong train because I feel like that's somehow more excusable. However, I would never say that an old lady fell at the stairs and I stayed with her until an ambulance arrived. Even if it actually happened, I would probably still go with ""wrong train"".

And if I tell a funny story, I add a ton of details hoping to make it more entertaining.

On more serious issues, I'm completely honest though. And I never blame anyone else for my mistakes, I usually just find a more likeable excuse.

Is this just an annoying behaviour that I should keep trying to overcome (I'm working on it) or does it really make me an asshole?",2015-11-26 23:24:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3uej5e/aita_for_lying_all_the_time/,3uej5e,12,14,0.83,0
36,asshole,AITA for not hanging out with girlfriend on her Bday,"So back in August I met this girl (we'll call her Jessica). Jessica and I started talking a lot and in early September we started dating. The relationship was pretty casual. We go to different schools so I would only get to see her on the weekends. Most of the time we would watch a movie or get food together. From what I could tell we were both pretty content with the direction the relationship was headed. 

*Before the story starts I want to lay out a few dates to prevent confusion:* 

**Finals Week**: November 2nd-6th

**SAT and Jessica's birthday**: November 7th

The first week of November was a stressful one for me. I had to take 5 finals (trimester schedule) and the following Saturday I had the SAT (I'm a junior in high school). To add insult to injury that Saturday was also Jessica's birthday. Obviously I wanted to make it special for her but I knew I was going to be completely exhausted by the end of the week. 

Friday after school Jessica and I were texting back and forth trying to figure out plans for her birthday tomorrow. This was my first time taking the SAT so I told her I'd most likely be free around 1 in the afternoon. Jessica tells me that should work because the rest of the night she is going to the mall with friends and getting dinner with her family. I also text her wishing her a happy birthday and give her a heads up that we will play tomorrow by ear because I will most likely be to exhausted to hang out. That night I purposely get to bed early with the intention to be rested enough to hang out Jessica. The whole night I was tossing and turning because I was so anxious about the SAT and making the day special for Jessica. 

Saturday morning I'm up bright and early at 7 AM and head over to the testing center. I text Jessica one more time wishing her a happy birthday and that I will text her once I finish the test. Overall the SAT took about 5 hours with the breaks we got in between sections. The test officially ended at 12:50 PM and I was completely exhausted so I got in my car and drove home. At 1 PM as I was about to text Jessica she texts me asking what the plan is. I text her back telling her that I am way to tired to hang out with her and that I need to go home and take a nap. She seems a little disappointed (which is understandable) and I text her back that I'm super sorry and that we can do something special tomorrow (she was busy the rest of the day). Jessica wasn't agreeing to hang out on a different day and eventually she stops responding to my texts.

Late Saturday night (like 11 PM) she texts me out of the blue asking if she can rant to me. I tell her yes and then she proceeds to write me a number of essays about how pissed off she is at me. She complains to me about how I ""blew her off on her birthday"" and that I ""was probably hanging out with other people anyways."" She also goes off on me about how it didn't seem like I cared. The first time she texted me I responded saying how I am sorry and that if we hung out I feel like I wouldn't have been able to make the day special for her and stuff. She keeps texting me and isn't accepting my apology so eventually I stop saying I'm sorry and I try to explain my side to her. I genuinely didn't do anything except go home, put on the TV, and fall asleep after the SAT. She kept accusing me of not caring and I eventually just tell her we need to hang out tomorrow and work it out in person.

Sunday comes around (the day she was very adamant about being to busy to hang out on) and we go out and get food at Panera. The whole time it was kind of awkward and we were just making small talk. As I am driving her back to her house, I tell Jessica that we should probably break up. I explain to her that I really enjoy spending time with her but I don't think it's working out. She agrees and I tell her that I hope we can still be friends. She seemed very content with the situation and she didn't freak out or get mad at me. I thought we ended the relationship on pretty good terms and I thought I handled the situation pretty maturely.

On Thanksgiving I wake up and she a text on my phone from Jessica. She said: **""Happy Thanksgiving!! So thankful we broke up omfg""** 

As soon as I read that text I got extremely pissed off and headed straight for the gym. Haven't texted her back or contacted her in anyway.

38,asshole,AITA for locking out my flatmate?,"So I have 2 flatmates, and all of us had one set of keys each to the apartment. We are all students living in the apartment because we study abroad. One of the flatmates forgot his keys at his parent's house when he came back after the winter break. So one day before he went out he asked me quickly if I was going to be home later tonight to open the door for him, I quickly said yes, forgetting that I had a class later. So I went on the day and just before the class started I remembered it and ran there. I forgot I said I'd be home because of the stress. After the class, I went by my friend's place (which is about 5 mins from our apartment) and we all decided to go eat in town and called a cab. I then checked my phone and the flatmate was locked out and I asked him to come and get the keys from my friend's apartment, because we had a cab waiting (I didn't tell him about the cab until later). He got really pissed about having to go all the way to my friend's place. 
I've known him a while before and we casually hung out but I started to realize he's quite selfish and arrogant, and he was generally a bad flatmate (e.g. not washing dishes/cleaning after him even after pointing it out). Apparently he thought everything was cool and didn't know I thought that way.

39,asshole,AITA for this teen drama,"This actually happened many years ago but I thought back to it recently and wondered if I was an asshole for what I did.

Essentially me and a friend both had a crush on a girl. He came forwards and told me about his feelings for her, being his friend I agreed to try and wingman for him, he had no idea I liked her. We were talking every so often and I was dropping hints and trying to find out how she felt about him.

Anyway, the one fateful day at a party I was talking to her and being drunk me after failing for most of the evening to get them together asked her if she had any feelings for him or found him attractive at all. No way apparently, she figured out ages ago that he liked her but didn't want to flat out reject him.

Here's where I'm potentially the asshole, a little while later I take my chance figuring that since their situation was now clearly a no no it was ok. Things went pretty well and understandably he was pissed.

To be honest I'm pretty sure I'm an asshole here but I would like to know how much of an asshole. As said this happened years ago and I haven't spoken to either of them for at least 2 years so it doesn't matter either way.

40,everyone sucks,AITA for confronting someone with the lack of facts in what they claim to be their factual opinion? (lots to read),"**Preface (feel free to skip):** So I came across this reddit-post on /r/misc which looked like someone plugging their own blog-post, which is allowed on that sub, but I personally disagreed with the content which made me go see whether OP posted it on any other sub where I could see other people's opinions (the post on /r/misc got no responses except for my own).

**Abstract:** OP x-posted this blog-entry on /r/technology where it actually got some attention, and there I saw this other person giving a very biased opinion on the subject. Basically he disagreed with OP, and like I said, I also disagree on some points OP makes but for very different reasons. At first I thought the other person was just a troll, so I only gave a 2-word response (which will be linked down below), but ever since this turned into a pretty ""interesting"" 2-day discussion, getting more and more off topic but in essence what made me hold a grudge (not a personal grudge mind you) was the fact that not only were his arguments not backed up by any facts (especially in the beginning), he very much claimed them to be factual.

41,asshole,AITA For going fishing?,"This situation is the center of a two year long argument between my group of friends. I just found this sub and it will have the final say. 

Two years ago i was dating a girl called Amanda, we had been together for the better part of three months. She invited me to a banquet for her sorority where it would be announced that she won their presidential election. For the record I agreed to this banquet three weeks ahead of time. 

fast forward two weeks: on Monday (the banquet was that Friday) I got a call from my Dad, He was fishing in an annual ed fish tournament. Every year I hoped that I would get a call that they had an open spot on the team. This was that call, the catch was that I had to be in Houston (a five hour drive) by Thursday night, making me miss the banquet. I said yes to my Dad immediately as this was something that I had been aching to do for years. 

As soon as I got off the phone, I went to lunch with Amanda and broke the news. She was obviously upset which is something I do feel bad about. I do not however regret going, the argument is that this is something that Amanda should never forgive me for. Which she said she did. I don't think I did anything that bad because it was something I really really cared about. 

So Reddit am I an asshole for missing something important to her and doing something important to me?

I waited until my papers were done being printed before I said, ""Y'know, it's probably best that you don't have a slice of cake.""

43,everyone sucks,AITA Cleaning the Kitchen,"The following exchange took place today between 11am and 7pm.
Oombao desired pizza. The first step to making pizza is cleaning the kitchen. Oombao cleaned the kitchen.
Floors: mopped, counters: scrubbed, cutting boards & knives: spotless. Enter: Jiebaseo .
Jiebaseo displaced Oombao , and prepared chinese food using the recently cleaned knives and cutting boards. Jiebaseo inquired whether they were in Oombao 's way. Oombao stated ""how 'in-my-way' you are will be determined by how clean the cutting board is when you're done,"" and vacated the kitchen in favour of cleaning the dining room.
Time elapsed and Jiebaseo was ""done"" with the kitchen. They declared that they were going to lie down and put in some eye drops, which Oombao knew to be a euphemism for taking a nap. Not wanting to clean the kitchen twice in one day, Oombao stated the following:
""You've left the knife edge-down on a plate again. I've told you repeatedly not to do that and now I'm going to have to sharpen it again. Also you've dirtied two cutting boards, and there's rice all over the counter. You have made a mess.""
Jiebaseo stated that Oombao was picking on them, and had a nap. When they awoke, Oombao had re-cleaned the kitchen and was now in a bad mood. Oombao was not polite in informing Jiebaseo of this reality.
Jiebaseo again stated that they were being picked on, and suggested that the house would be cleaner if it had fewer things in it, namely the possessions belonging to Oombao; and it would be were they all absent. Oombao took offense at the suggestion and informed Jiebaseo that they were too fat and lazy to effectively pursue such a course of action.

46,everyone sucks,AITA for trying to learn if my best friend's boyfriend is cheating on her?,"**Disclaimer:** I know this is stupidly long. It's been really eating away at me, so any feedback/advice would be appreciated. 

After just reading the title, I would definitely call myself an asshole. Let me provide some context, but preface this by saying I had nothing but good intentions.

Me and D have been best friends for about eight years now, and for awhile, she's been one of the only girl friends that I have. She has a history of having very unstable, chaotic relationships, and she has a tendency to jump from one relationship to the next. She broke up with her emotionally manipulative boyfriend of two years in March, and has tried (unsuccessfully) to reenter two serious relationships since then, and then had some FWBs after being rejected by them. D is the type of girl that's very easily offended and will pick fights over stupid things (we're 25, and she stopped talking to me for a month because I didn't offer her a glass of water when she came over and she decided that this was indicative of my selfish character as a friend). 

Anyway, we both have had this triend, J, for years. He's your standard ""nice guy"" who always wanted more from both of us during different periods of time, but we both saw him as a big brother. If either me or D hung out with him alone, he would buy that person dinner, smoke that person out, fill up that person's gas tank, etc. When D entered her long term relationship, J stopped talking to her completely and started spending all of his time with me. When I got a boytriend, he stopped talking to me altogether. It hurt, to be honest, because I always made it very clear that I saw him as exclusively a friend, but I respected his wishes. When D broke up with her asshat boyfriend, she and J started hanging out again, and she constantly referred to him as annoying. I moved across the country, and she promised to come visit me but had concern that J wanted to come and he was ""so annoying."" She never came to visit, shit happens. 

I guess now would be an appropriate time to mention that D had a slight opiate problem, and decided to get clean (words can't express how proud I am of her). J was with her throughout the entire process. She briefly told me about what went on about a week after the fact, and then sort of stopped talking to me altogether - she stopped answering my texts, didn't return my calls. I didn't think too much of it because I did move away, and I understand people can talk less frequently with distance. After a few weeks, I was starting to feel a bit hurt and missed my friend.

Then, something popped up on Facebook that I never, ever expected happening: D and J are in a relationship. 

I immediately texted her and congratulated her, despite my shock. She always referred to J as being incredibly unattractive, and would joke about how badly he wanted her. Part of me thought that she got together with him because the girl can't stand the thought of being alone and had been rejected by the past three men she developed feelings for. But mainly, I was so happy because J had always been a sweet, attentive guy who cared for her. D sent me a brief text explaining that she had fallen for him throughout her detox, and then ghosted me again for another two weeks. I decided to give her space.

Well, a couple days ago, I received a notification that J had signed up for Kik. I thought this was odd, since he's a rather isolated dude and from my experience and knowledge, Kik is used primarily for sexting/somewhat private IMing. His profile picture was of him shirtless.

So I sent him a message saying, ""what are you doing on here?"" He asked who I was, and **here's where I might have started to become the asshole.** 

Since I was sketched out, I remained ambiguous and told J that he had asked for me to add him awhile ago to trade pics. I decided to see if he was being faithful to D, and asked to trade pictures with him. He immediately sent me a picture of a chick sucking a dick - I couldn't tell whose dick it was, and I didn't know the girl, but a reverse image search suggested that he didn't get it off the Internet.

So I continued to play the role of catfish, because I wanted to see if he was actually going to sext a stranger after entering a relationship with my best friend. I sent him pictures of some random chick in return, and he continued to send me face pics. I asked if he thought I was cute, and he said ""yes"" and that he was happy that I messaged him. When I asked him if he was single, he said ""it's complicated."" I told him that ""I"" didn't want to be involved with someone that was attached, and his response was ""I never said that I wasn't single."" 

At this point I felt disturbed enough that I needed to tell D what was going on. I took screenshots of the conversation and I tried calling her; no response. I texted her saying that I had something important to tell her and asked her to call me when she was alone; her response was that she had schoolwork to do and just to text her. The rest of the conversation went something like this:

>Me: Are you and J in an open relationship or are you monogamous? I have something really important to tell you that I'd rather say on the phone.

>D: If you're polygamous, I'm sorry but I honestly don't really wanna hear about it because I consider it being unfaithful and I think it's nasty

>M: It's not about me. Can you please just call me?

>D: Why can't you just text it to me

>M: Because text messages can be construed the wrong way, and I would like to be able to provide the correct context. Trust me, you'll see texts. 

>D: I can't talk on the phone right now, just text me.

>M: So I got an alert this morning saying that ""J"" joined kik. Kik is a private instant messaging app that people generally use for sexting or drug deals. I thought it was weird that he had it, so I sent him a msg asking what he was doing on there. He didn't deem to know it was me, so I got a bad feeling and played into it. I pretended to be some girl. 

At this point, J messaged me on Kik saying, ""How's [state I moved to]? Have a good time at that wedding this weekend?"" 

>And then: ""It's D, M. What's up? Lol."" 

>So I texted D back, saying:

>>""So if you're with him right now, and if you're the one responding to me on Kik, it's important to know that he has the capability to delete messages. I have screenshots of the entire conversation. Are you typing to me right now from Kik? I'm trying to do the right thing and help you."" 

>D: I just read all of it and yes that was me.

>M: [sent her all the screenshots]

>D: I already read them before you told me about it. I already saw all that.

>And then on J's Kik: 
>>Yeah he told me about it earlier today and that he was pretty sure it was you so he fucked with you

>M to D: Well, I hope that he genuinely was fucking with me, because I'd be concerned if [my boyfriend] were sending random pictures to a stranger on kik.

And then nothing - she ghosted me again.

I know that I overstepped my boundaries here, and that it wasn't my place to try and see if he'd cheat on her. But I did it all out of love for my friend - and I'm uncomfortable with the lack of acknowledgement on her part. 

I miss my friend, and I'm not sure why she's been distancing me so much lately. What can I do to rectify this situation? Should I apologize? Should I give her space? I'm genuinely just seeking honest feedback on this matter - I want to make things right, it seems like my interference here just pushed her farther away. Can I have your thoughts, Reddit?

**TLDR** My best friend got into a relationship with our mutual friend, who randomly created a Kik. I catfished him to try and find out his intentions and showed the messages to her, but she claims to have already known about them.

47,everyone sucks,AITA for ruining my girlfriend's concert?,"To put it shortly a few weeks ago me and my girlfriend went to a concert together. Neither of us are the party/concert/club/etc types but she likes that stuff occasionally and she begged me to go with her to this concert. I went with her and pretended to enjoy it for the first part of it but then she went off to dance with a group of strangers. She asked first if I wanted to come with her to dance with them, I declined, then she immediately walked off to dance with them.

I got a bit upset at this because I came to an event that I hated and felt extremely uncomfortable with because she begged me to and now she isn't even keeping me company. When she got back from dancing I was obviously annoyed and upset and wasn't able to pretend I liked the event anymore. She noticed this, asked what's wrong, I told her, she just dismissed it

The next 1/3rd of the concert was pretty much me obviously annoyed and failing to fake enjoyment. Then another group of strangers started dancing, she asked if I wanted to. I said no, she asked if she could go off to dance with them. I told her she can but I'm going to leave the event because I'm not staying alone at an event I hate. She was understandably pissed at me after that. We had a fight and made up but I'm still not sure who was the asshole here.

I know I overreacted, but I would never leave her side at an event when I know she's uncomfortable and hating the event. Especially not to dance with people I don't even know.",2016-09-12 04:15:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/52cl3n/aita_for_ruining_my_girlfriends_concert/,52cl3n,6,11,0.83,0
48,asshole,AITA for how I talked to another user on deviantART?,"Now I'm not going to name this user of course. Also they've since deleted the journal that this happened on in question, so I'll be paraphrasing.

So this user has made various depressive journals, and this one in question talked about how they wished they could make all humans disappear and undo the damage we've done. I took a bit of umbrage to this idea, and told them that I disagreed and thought that we should better ourselves from what we've done, instead of trying to redo what we lost.

He responds be saying how he doesn't see a point to life, and that he has a respect for mother nature and thinks that he thinks it's better to undo humanity and that we refuse to better our impact on the Earth.

I respond by saying as someone who once suffered from depression and better myself from it, I understand how they feel, but don't see a point in being so depressively pessimistic as a result. I then explain how we never intended to damage the Earth, and only really noticed our impact in the last few decades, and that we should try to better ourselves with what we have instead of trying redo what was lost because of us.

His final response accuses me of looking down on him and thinking I was better then he was, and then tells me to leave his page and don't come back.

Now my response back may have been going too far honestly. I respond by saying I tried to help, but he chose to reject it, and instead decided to wallow in his own self-pity, and how I lost any respect I had for him up to that point.

I have since blocked him, and I assume he did the same.

Now I'm torn. I don't know If I was being to hard on him and overly condescending at all, or if my frustration with him is justified. I have difficulties comprehending my actions sometimes, and I feel this may have been one of those moments.

I don't know, am I the a-hole in this situation?

**Edit:** After reading the comments, yeah, I was being a bit of a dick here. Although I honestly was trying to help the guy out, I shouldn't have presumed I understood him. Also, my final response to him was totally unwarranted, and the result of letting my anger getting the better of me.

49,asshole,AITA for not feeling bad for my oldest sister?,"Tldr at the end...

This side of my family has had many problems and doesn't get along as well as it should. This story is very long and hard to explan though I will try my best.

My mother had my oldest sister at a time when she was too young to understand what she was doing we think, at 19 years old, and wasn't always the best. She didn't have the money to let her do everything she wanted and she made many mistakes by being harder on her than she was with the rest of us. I don't know the full story here and it's hard for me to talk on something I'm not sure of. Even so, from what I can remember, my mother has always tried reaching out to make up for her mistakes and all my oldest sister has done is be worse to her and even more so to my grandparents who have cared for her. She is selfish and rude to everyone of us. I know her life is hard because of her illness (RSD), but even before this it was still true.

Now to this situation, my mother recently told me that she is in the hospital. Apparently she had hallucinated from her antianxiety or antidepressant she had been taking for awhile. We just got the news that she has ulcers inside of her stomach that have been causing an incredible amount of pain.

Even though I don't wish this on her, I just felt emotionless when told this. My mother is emotional about the fact that her oldest child would be more stressed by her (their relationship is incredibly strained) being there than if she just stays away. I find myself just feeling bad for my grandparents and mother and not my sister. She never made any attempt to be a real sister to me throughout my life (she's quite a bit older than me) and I feel no connection as family.

Tldr: Me and my oldest sister have little to no connection due to family tensions my entire life. Am I the asshole for not feeling bad for her when she's in the hospital even though she's technically family?",2016-10-31 14:15:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/5acgc9/aita_for_not_feeling_bad_for_my_oldest_sister/,5acgc9,10,10,0.83,0
50,asshole,AITA for locking my brother outside in the rain?,"General background:
     My brother John(27) and I(21F Jessica) both live at home with our mother and we're both unemployed. John recently got a few days of construction work from our uncle. John and Ma don't really get along much but she trusts him at home.


**My Side:**
     Around 4PM John calls and says he'll be done with work around 7 and that he finally got paid. Around 8 Ma asks me to call him because she has to go to a Christmas party and doesn't want to leave me alone because a string of robberies have occurred nearby. John says he'll be back before 9 since he's hanging out with our cousin Wally(26). I call him at 10 because he still wasn't back, he claims he's still in a magic match but that he's almost finished. At 11:30 I hear knocking on the front door and I see that John's car is in the driveway so I decide to make him wait a few minutes as punishment. 10 minutes later I go to the front door and open it to find John and Wally on the porch. That's when I slammed the door shut in anger and sent them a message to wait for Ma to come back if they wanted to go inside. They waited for a bit then drove off.

   I don't like Wally very much because he encourages John's use of synthetic marijuana and lies about it. I'm pretty goddamn sure they were smoking and lost track of the time. I *would have* let John in if Wally wasn't there, Wally isn't even allowed to stay over for the night so either he *was* going to stay over or they were just passing through. 

**John's side:**
     He was working 4 days straight in misty weather for our asshole uncle. After all that he got paid around $300  and went to the local comic shop to buy the new Commander deck. Then John went to Wally's place because all of John's decks were there and he wanted to replace some cards with the ones he bought. He got the call around 8 that he needs to go back home but he's tired from all the work and wants to test out the new deck against someone who actively plays since Jessica no longer plays magic. Commander games go on for hours, especially when you're testing out new cards and then John got the call at 10:30. He and Wally wrap up the game and drive home but once they get there around 11:15 Jessica doesn't open the door. They knock on the front door and windows until the door finally opens but as soon as it does it gets slammed shut. Jessica just sends them a text telling them to wait for Ma. Once the rain got heavy they leave in the truck.

**tldr**: I locked out my older bro because he was possibly high and stayed out far longer than he was supposed to.

Edit: I should mention that I'm currently injured to the point where I can barely walk and John moved in to be my caretaker during the evening.
Our mother has an order of protection against Wally which is why he's not allowed on the property.",2016-12-24 20:41:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/5k4yfv/aita_for_locking_my_brother_outside_in_the_rain/,5k4yfv,26,57,0.94,0
51,asshole,AITA for wanting my live-in girlfriend to not talk on the phone in the morning while I'm trying to sleep?,"I know how things tend to go on this sub. Even though you're supposed to ""describe **both sides in detail**"", most people can't help but let their personal bias bleed through. This post is long because I'm trying really hard to be upfront about my natural biases, but there's a quick **TL;DR** at the bottom if you want the basic, bias-crammed AITA.

I'll (31M) dive right into it: I've been living with my girlfriend (29F) for a year and a half now. We argue here and there like any couple, and have been working on our communication, especially when arguing. 

I'm a light sleeper. She's a heavy sleeper. Always have been. Always will be. She has an earlier sleep schedule than me, so I'm normally still awake for a while at night after she goes to bed, and she's normally awake in the morning while I'm still sleeping. 

At night I put on headphones while watching TV after she goes to bed so I don't wake her. She's now telling me that she never asked me to do that, which is true, but I don't want to run the risk of accidentally waking her.

Normally, when she wakes up before me she's pretty quiet, but she's woken me up before, because it just doesn't occur to her that she's being loud enough to wake me. I don't think it ever crosses her brain, because I think she cannot fathom how someone could be awaken so easily. Meanwhile I'm quiet as a mouse while she's asleep, because I can't fathom how noise *wouldn't* wake her up.

Here comes the asshole part. Last night I went to bed around 3am. (Neither of us have anything to wake up for for a couple of days, so fuck it, I'm staying up and sleeping in.) While she was sleeping, I was my usual mouse-like self. However, this morning she woke up at 8am because she couldn't sleep. I was awoken at 8:30am because she was talking to her friend on the phone. 

In her defense, she was speaking quietly, but what little bass she has in her voice still travels through the wall of our one-bedroom apartment. Although I couldn't hear what she was saying, it sounded like Charlie Brown's parents were talking in the living room just on the other side of the wall by my head. I continued to try to sleep but couldn't. 

For the sake of transparency, at this point I'll admit I did a bit of a dick move. I got up and closed the door somewhat loudly to get the point across that she woke me (I didn't slam it, but it was still loud.) I should have said something, but I was clouded by anger and sleepy head. I laid back down in bed for another ten minutes but she kept talking.

I got up again, accepting my fate of little sleep. She was still on the phone as I got dressed and put the leash on the dog. As I went outside to walk the dog, I heard her say something, but I kept walking out. 

I didn't hear her, assuming she was talking to her friend and not me, but again, I'll be transparent and admit that I left in a bit of a huff. Dick move, but part of us working on our communication is taking a moment to calm down before engaging in the argument. I took some deep breaths as I walked my dog, and prepared to talk to her when I got back.

I walk into the apartment and she's gone. I checked the parking lot and her car was gone too. I check my phone for anything from her, but nothing. This raised my anger again, so I was working on a text that told her off, but realized I should take some time to calm down. 

I deleted my text before I even finished it, browsed Reddit for a couple hours, and calmed down. I still hadn't heard from her, so I decided to break the silence. Here's my text verbatim: ""Mornin' babe! Hope you're having a swell day so far! When ya comin' back? Love you! [cute emojis]""

After another half hour or so she calls me back. She's calm, but says, ""What was going on this morning? I hope you weren't mad for me talking to my friend."" I say, ""Well yes, I was upset that you woke me up so early, but I've calmed down now.""

This triggered her. She starts telling me how she's not going to apologize for talking to her friend. I stay quiet because the only thing coming to my mind is blind anger. She continues telling me how she's not in the wrong. Whenever I tried to defend my position, she would interrupt me with her defense before I could finish. 

More transparency: At this point I'm seething because I'm not being heard, so the third or so time she interrupts me, I hang up on her. (Dick move, I know.) She calls back and I ignore it, then send a text saying, ""I'm mad. I need space.""

She sends me a text back telling me that she's mad too and that I was childish for walking out earlier instead of talking to her. 

This begins a text argument. (So much for space, but it's my fault for engaging.) I wont type out the rest of the argument unless someone has questions about it. It's quite long. The broad strokes are that I told her she's disrespecting my sleep when she's on the phone with her friends. She says she won't be a prisoner in my apartment and she can talk to her friends whenever she wants to.

As I typed this up, we agreed to talk about it later today after I've calmed down. Fair enough. 

I'm bringing this to AITA to find out if I'm really treating her like a prisoner because I expect her to send a text to her friends saying something along the lines of, ""Hey my boyfriend is sleeping. We can text or I can call you in a little bit after he wakes up."" But of course, let me know if I'm being an asshole anywhere else during this tale. If anyone has any questions, I'll be open and honest with my answer because I really want to get to the bottom of this.

**TL;DR:** I'm (31M) a light sleeper, so when my girlfriend (29F) talks with her friends on the phone in the morning, it wakes me up and I get mad.",2017-01-15 21:51:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/5o6o18/aita_for_wanting_my_livein_girlfriend_to_not_talk/,5o6o18,42,56,0.98,0
52,asshole,AITA for not wanting my boyfriend to leave his deodorant out on the counter?,"Pretty much just what the title says. My boyfriend has a habit of leaving his deodorant on the counter instead of in the bathroom. I asked him if he could leave it in the bathroom and he said he likes it on the counter. Then I asked if he could maybe put it on his desk then if he wanted it out in the living area. He then told me to put my purse and pictures and decorations on my desk instead of the counter if that's how I felt about it. I told him it's not because it's his item but because it's something that gets spread on his armpits so it's more a sanitary thing that just having stuff lying around. 

So tell me, am I the asshole for asking him not to leave his deodorant on the counter?

Edit: KITCHEN counter people, not in the bathroom. My bad for not specifying. In any case, I've decided I'm either going to back down completely and learn to live with the minor annoyance, or I might offer that if he keeps it on his desk instead I'll fix/move something of mine that annoys him.

53,asshole,AITA for being mad my roommate for not telling me my timer went off?,"I spent like five hours today making bread - mixing it, kneading it, letting it rise, kneading it again and letting it rise again. I popped it in the oven and put on a timer. Unbeknownst to me, my roommate went downstairs and when the timer went off, she turned it off, she didn't do anything with the oven or bread, texted me to tell me my timer went off, even though I'm right upstairs, and proceeded to just go about her business. I didn't receive the text because I didn't have my phone on me. I realized I hadn't heard the timer go off and went downstairs to check and the bread was way overdone, just a shade below burning, and she's all like, yeah I texted you. I was livid. I'd spent so much time working on the bread, and it was ruined. I could have been more attentive to the time, but I feel really upset that she didn't think to let me know when she didn't see me respond or come downstairs. She said she didn't want to disturb me....Am I the asshole here?

Edit: I think it's important to note that this person isn't someone I just live with. We are supposedly friends. I listen to her problems, she listens to mine. I go out of my way to make sure she's alright and vice versa. It's very copacetic. The fact that she turned off the timer and didn't tell me *when she knows I am not a texter, don't keep my phone on me* felt *intentional* and hurtful to have ignored the timer and acted like it was my fault. If it was just any other old day when I was baking bread and I lived with someone I didn't know well, it would be one thing. But, that is not our relationship. She always talks about how close we are. In this scenario, this was tantamount to aggression. Men may not understand. Women will get it better because ladies do this sort of thing, unfortunately. I feel totally gaslighted.

55,everyone sucks,AITA For my frustration at my smoker girlfriend who stops me smoking (rather long context),"Ok so quite alot of context is needed for this. My girlfriends one of them typical young age smokers (been smoking since she was 14) so already there is that hypocrisy thing going on. (Im 19, shes 18). Now i do understand she cares for me alot. Like so much its almost annoying haha. But this is the thing. Now i struggle with mental health and have done since the age of 12, Ive had my suicidal times and on top of that i find it extremely hard to contain my anger. When my head gets bad, which is often i become a completely different person. I get extremely snappy and say things in anger and even (NEVER TO MY GIRLFRIEND I MUST STRESS, ID NEVER LAY A HAND ON HER) become prone to fighting. Yes, my girlfriend helps however not often enough. Which is purly because of my mental health. 

Now during a show at college of which i had lead part, i played a boy called William in a show called ""punk rock"" (look it up its a great play) which deals with mental health and during which i had like a mini mental breakdown and since then (been a year now) i havnt been able to get back on stage or even continue my college course. Back to my anger, i have much to be angry about. I had a reject alcoholic father, an alcoholic mother who failed in almost every way to be a parent. I got a way out into two family friends whom i thought to be loving.  If i piss em off even just a little (which is never intentional and often im innocent but thats an entirely different story) i get death threats and all that. My own mental health which i struggle with in so many fucking ways. A college tutor who understands nothing. And literally so much more but if i was to type it, itd lose the point of the post and it just isnt relevant. Point is i have much to be angry about. 

So far then, i struggle with mental health. I have gone from a shitty parent to even shittier. I had a breakdown which continues to hold me back. And my girlfriend can only help so much. I realised cigarettes actually take all my anger out of me. This stops me completely fucking up my relationship. It also calms my head down considerably. 

Now, this is where it gets even more of a pisstake. She has no problem buying backy for her underage friends. Giving fags to people who dont smoke (twice) and even when in in absolute tears, and hurting so much shell only reluctantly allow me a single toke. Which of course does nothing. A few times ive smoked and she found out and it nearly ended my relationship. I could be suicidal and still not allowed one which i know would help. 

Doesnt end here. I have finally managed to compromise for a vape. Althought nowhere near as helpful im greatfull its something. However she treats it like its ""ours"" (its not, was given by a friend for me for my head. She has fags) and she can again, use it whenever she wants. I cant. If i do she gets once again, very shitty. 

So am i the asshole for getting extremely frustrated because i cant have a fag to help me calm down no matter how bad i am (shes even seen me in absolute tears till she reluctanlty gave in and wasnt happy about it) but she can give fags to underage friends who she also cares about, and fags to people that dont smoke?

Edit: Sorry quite important. Ive never smoked before. I just found out it helps

56,everyone sucks,AITA for telling my friend's girlfriend about his true intentions with their relationship?,"This will be a longer one.

Myself, best friend and his girlfriend moved into an apartment together for college a few years ago and had been living together up until the end of this spring semester. My friend and I have know each other since elementary school and have been good friends since middle school.  We get along super well and have a lot in common especially sense of humor. (Immagine a milder version of the scrubs bromance between J.D. and Turk.) This is sort of embarrassing to say but he was really my only friend. I had acquaintances from class that I would hang out with and work out with from time to time, but no one that I was really close with. Apart from having a pretty big ego and some insecurities of which I have only just realized this past semester, we got along really well.  I also knew that had a fairly regular habit of lying and manipulating. (Mostly parents, acquaintances and his girlfriend although I was never aware of anything too awful in regards to his girlfriend until more recently.) I was passive and ignored these habits for years because we got along so well otherwise and I was never friends with, or close to anyone that he would lie to and manipulate.  Fast forward to the beginning of this spring semester.  

I started to become friends with his girlfriend as I didn't have anyone around the apartment to talk to during most of the day.  He was not around our apartment very much due to working 30 hours a week and a heavier class schedule. She and I would mostly watch netflix.  We were eventually good enough friends that we went to a bar together to meet one of her single friends and possibly set me up with her. It didn't end up working out as her single friend was extremely drunk, which I don't find very attractive, especially for a first impression.

Later in the semester he started to tell me about a girl that he was working with at his job.  He said that he wished that he was single so that he could date her instead or get his current girlfriend to agree to an open relationship so that he could see if he liked his coworker better that his girlfriend. He said that he likes his girlfriend but doesn't see himself staying with her for the long haul. He said that he promised himself when they first started dating if someone better came along he would break up with her for the new person.  I know his girlfriend well and an open relationship would be completely out of the question. Whenever he would talk about conversations that he had with other girls she would regularly comment ""Do I have to fight this bitch?"". She clearly expressed that she would not be into anything other than a committed relationship.

He decided that he would gradually be more and more shitty to her until she decided to break up with him. He wanted to go this route rather than telling her outright that he wanted to break up.  At first I was ok with this. I was much better friends with him than I was with her. I also figured that she would break up with him relatively quickly based on the way that he was treating her.  (noting physical, only verbal and body language.)  This kept going on for months and I started to feel bad for her.  I told him that the whole situation was bothering me and that he should do something about it. (implying that I wanted him to either stop treating her like shit or break up with her.  He ignored me and continued his previous behavior. She had been nice to me and I was just standing by watching and keeping his secret. 

 Throughout this time he was constantly texting and snapchatting his co worker.  At first he would lie to her about who he was texting and then later on he would tell the truth about who he was texting but not about the nature of their conversations. I never saw the conversations between him and his co worker, however I could tell that  they were flirty.  I know that his girlfriend would not be ok with constant regular text conversations with other girls let alone that they were flirty.  

After I started to feel bad for her I also started to develop a crush on her.  I don't think that she had any of the same feelings, and in the back of my head I knew that we weren't completely compatible but nonetheless that's how I felt.  As the situation progressed I decided to tell him that I would be interested in dating her if they broke up, but that I wouldn't pursue her if it would make things weird between us after they were broken up.  Bro's before hoe's type stuff...etc.  He immediately replied to my text. Paraphrasing ""Nah man I think she and I will be fine. I'm just being an asshole because I'm depressed since my grandpa died."" He continued saying that ""he didn't think that it would be weird if I dated her if they ever broke up.""  I replied with something like ""It's cool. No problem bruh"". I was highly skeptical of his excuse for being shitty to his girlfriend based on the fact that he had such an interest in his co worker and would regularly ask his dog if he ""wanted a new mommy"" while he and I were hanging out at the apartment.  In addition, both of our grandparents had recently passed away a few months ago.  I had grieved enough and had gotten passed it.  I thought that he had done the same as he hadn't mentioned his grandfather in quite a long time and seemed to be just as happy as he had been before.  I really didn't care if he was lying or not. The bottom line was that he said that he thinks they will be fine.  I have never had any intention of stealing my best friend's girlfriend. 


When I got home from class we picked up our normal conversations and started our usual joking around like normal.  For the next month or so his behavior took a complete 360 degree turn from being super shitty to being much more polite, doing his share of the chores, and even getting her donuts in the morning.  I still liked her but was completely content with just being friends with her. I just wanted my best friend to be happy, and I was relieved that for the time being I was no longer in the middle holding on to the knowledge of his true intentions.  

Everything was just like normal until after I went to the bar with her to meet her single friend like I had mentioned earlier.  The next morning she was extremely rude and short with me. I just ignored it and chalked it up to her being in a bad mood. This behavior continued for another week.  I had no idea why she was acting like this.  I gradually become more resentful of her actions as I could see no cause for them and our friendship severely dwindled.  We would barely acknowledge each other throughout the day, however I never returned her rude behavior.

Eventually he returned to being shitty, lying to her and manipulating her while being emotionally invested in his co worker. He was constantly texting and snapping her like before. He essentially returned to all his previous shitty behavior trying again to get her to break up with him.  This time I couldn't care less how he treated her. I felt like she had stomped all over our friendship for no discernible reason.  I let things get ever worse this time.  

One night all 3 of us were getting pretty drunk and watching tv together.  He texted me from across the couch that one of the more disliked characters in the tv show that we were watching was metaphorically speaking [insert girlfriend's name]. I Replied ""Hahaha R.I.P. [insert girlfriend's name]"" followed by a couple gifs of people laughing.  He replied ""lol she'll be fine.""  

This was a major turning point, not only for the story but also for me as a person. I regretted what I texted him the previous night and felt like a completely horrible human being (as I should have).  It made me rethink what kind of person I wanted to be as well as take a long look in the mirror as to who I was going to become if I continued this type of behavior. I though about the notion that your personality is an average of the people you spend the most time with.  I realized that my best friend was an extremely poor influence on my character.  Years ago I would have never let things get this bad.  Possibly worst of all I thought to myself, If he will do this to the girl that he supposedly loves, what would he do to his best friend in the future?

A few weeks went by and I observed as my friend continued to be completely shitty to her.  He would lie and manipulate her in front of me, and then brag about how good he was at it later on.  I was too much of a pussy to tell him that what he was doing was bothering me so much, especially after what I had texted him the night that we were all drunk.  It got bad enough one night that he told me that she had asked him in private if he was trying to break up with her to which he replied ""I don't know"".  During that conversation he said that he manipulated her by telling her it was all his fault and that his behavior didn't have anything to do with her.  He said that their conversation ended with her in tears saying that she wasn't going to give up on him and wanted to make it work.  He told me that his reaction to this (he only shared this with me) was ""Fuuuuuuuuck seriously...""  He said that he thinks the only reason that he wants to stay with her is so that he won't be alone. Knowing all of this information caused me to start grinding my teeth at night. It was also starting to affect my schoolwork.  The next few days I watched her putting in extra effort to their relationship to be helpful and thoughtful.  

I couldn't stand to watch him lie and manipulate her and get away with it.
One day I finally got up the courage to tell her the truth in the form of a letter that I sent her as a pdf file in text message.  I couldn't bear to tell her in person, and I know that I would have started crying and not articulated it very well. I decided that it was in the best interest of my character to cut my best friend out of my life and move on to make better friends.  I never asked or expected her to keep the information that I shared with her from my him, however in her reply she thanked me multiple times and told me that she wouldn't throw me under the bus. I met with her and her mom at lunch a few days later to discuss the rent situation as she would need his and my signatures in order to exit our lease. She said that it wasn't fair to me to have to pay half the rent instead of one third since she was leaving him immediately. Her mom said that she would continue to pay her part of the rent until our lease was up at the end of the semester. This ended up being unnecessary as his parents offered to pay for it instead.  

She said that she would wait to tell him until i moved out at the end of the semester to transfer to a different school, and she did. Fast forward to a few days ago. I got 2 text messages from him.  (Paraphrased) ""You betrayed me for a crush that you had on my ex.""  ""I should have kicked you out when you told me that you would be interested in dating her if we ever broke up.  I was depressed as fuck and needed help, and then you fucking move away. Don't ever talk to me again.""

These 2 texts are the reason that I am writing this extremely way too long post.
His reasoning for why I told her about everything caught me off guard.  ""You betrayed me for a crush that you had on my ex.""  Up until now the reason that I told her the truth was always that I didn't like the influence that I felt he had on my character as well as the the direction that my character would continue to go if I stayed friends with him. I also couldn't bear to watch him get away with lying and manipulating people anymore. Would he do the same thing to his best friend, and do I want to live with the constant worry that he is lying to me.  I never realized how much lying to people could hurt them until I saw it happen first hand to someone that I cared about.

I think that there is a part of me that was jealous and resentful of him for her loving him even though he constantly lied to and manipulated her.  Even though he was a complete asshole for treating her like this, am I still at fault for telling his girlfriend about everything that he has done without making more of an effort to express my discontent with his actions?

TLDR: Am I at fault for not making more of an effort to express how my best friend's actions towards his girlfriend were wrong before telling her the truth about his intentions.

57,asshole,AITA for getting angry around my gf for no reason?,"Firstly and most important, I never yell at her, verbally abuse or anything like that.

Thing is, I get annoyed and angry sometimes. Out of the blue. Like once or twice every week. I just need 20 minutes alone and I'm good. I have some mental issues, as does she. In fact, we first met on an online chat for helping with depression, anxiety, panic and other stuff like that. I actually managed to cut way down my drinking in the period we've been together, meaning I no longer drink by myself.

So we were talking on the phone, and she had this hysterical laughing fit while texting one of her friends. She wouldn't shut the fuck up, she was laughing maniacally for like 5 minutes! I was pretty anxious already, and it started to make my chest physically hurt.

I rudely interrupted her laughter, and asked her if I could call her back in an hour or so, this time with a dead serious and angry tone. Too bad, she didn't answer my calls anymore. Won't text me back. We are logged on a private chat 24/7 for just the two of us, in case we can't communicate via phone, and she logged off. It's been 2 days and no contact.

My anxiety is sky high right now. Today, June 12th, is ""Valentine's Day"" where I live, for fucks sake. I feel like a piece of shit.





Edit: update: she called me. We're okay now. :) I'm going to see a shrink with my brother and mom this week. We're all messed up. Hope it helps me. Don't want to lose her.

58,asshole,AITA for continuing to argue when someone backpedals,"I'm pretty sure I'm an asshole when I do this, so I'm more asking for help understanding why it's an asshole thing to do and what I should do instead.  I don't exactly have great social skills, so please help me. While I don't really get in major arguments that often with people, I do get into somewhat trivial arguments with my close friends and family at least once a month, and a common aspect of those arguments is that I'll continue to argue if they backpedal, unless they also give a good apology.  I'll give a specific example that happened a couple days ago. I'll do my best to be as accurate as possible, but I don't think the quotes that I'll give are 100% verbatim. I think they're close, though.

My boyfriend and I, who both play a lot of video games, were talking about video games over the phone. We talked about Dragon Age: Inquisition, and I had mistakenly thought that my boyfriend had played it before, and he corrected me, telling me that he played it for only an hour before stopping. He likes the series, but he didn't like Dragon Age II much, which discouraged him from continuing the series. I like the entire series quite a lot.

After that, we moved on to talking about Xenoblade Chronicles, which is one of his favorite games, and I'm looking forward to playing it someday. He talked for a while about everything that he loves about it, and at one point, he said, ""Oh yeah, the reason that I stopped playing Inquisition is because Xenoblade Chronicles does it better."" It wasn't clear what ""it"" was, but I think he was referring to the sidequest system and the gameplay.  I don't know much about Xenoblade Chronicles, so I don't really have an opinion on that, but I actually don't especially like the gameplay in Inquisition either.

Based on his tone and his words, I found what he said to be a bit dismissive about a game that I really like, and while I tried to let it go at first, I ultimately decided to tell him that that was a rude thing to say about a game that I like, and I went on to say that that is a foolish reason to not give a game more of a chance, especially when that game was pretty well-received and many of his friends like the game. While I tried to say that calmly, I'm sure I sounded a bit irritated.

He, also sounding irritated, responded that it wasn't dismissive or rude because he also likes Dragon Age (the first game, anyway) and he intends on playing Inquisition someday, too. He also said that he was praising Xenoblade Chronicles and not insulting Inquisition. 

This is the part where I think I was an asshole. I told him that he was insulting Inquisition because of the way he phrased it and because he gave it as a reason for why he stopped playing after an hour.  We then got into an argument about what he originally said, and after a minute or so, when it was clear that this wasn't going to be resolved with a ""Sorry, I was rude,"" I said, ""I'm willing to drop this, if you want. I don't think there's any point in continuing to argue about this."" He was very quiet for a minute, and when I asked if he was okay, he said, in a forced calm voice, that he was sorry for being rude and dismissive and that he didn't want to talk any more tonight. ""Good night.""

To be honest, I actually wasn't that upset about the conversation anymore and more worried about him, which is why I decided to ask about my behavior on here.  We have since apologized to each other, and he even sent me a gift on Steam (because of the Summer Sale) to apologize, though I actually feel uncomfortable when I receive apology gifts, especially when I consider myself to also be at fault.  I thanked him for it, though, of course.

So, in those types of arguments, where I argue with someone when they backpedal and they try to say that they didn't say/mean to say that when I believe they did say/mean to say that, am I an asshole? I think I was, at least a little bit, because what if he was telling the truth? I think for him, regardless of what he actually said, it probably was the truth.  On the other hand, I've backpedaled before, and I remember a few times in high school where I tried to lie and pretend that I didn't say what I know I said.  Either way, assuming that I know someone's thoughts is rude, too, right?

What would a kind person do, in my shoes? Accept their not-apology? Explain my point-of-view, let them tell me theirs, and drop it? Don't bring it up in the first place? 

TL;DR: Am I an asshole for arguing when someone tries to take back what they say? Specific example: Boyfriend and I got into an argument about video games. He said something dismissive about a game that I really like. I said that what he said was rude. He said he didn't mean to insult the game. I said he did mean to insult the game. Am I the asshole in that situation for not dropping the argument after he said that he didn't mean to insult the game?

Edit: Typos.

Edit: Thanks for your replies and your verdicts, everyone. And an even bigger thank you to those who went out of their way to explain their perspective. I apologized to my boyfriend again, and he took it very well and doesn't seem to hold any negative feelings regarding our argument. As for my question about arguing when someone qualifies or takes back what they said, the consensus is not to do it when it's a trivial argument, I think? And also to believe the person when they're qualifying what they're saying. I'll try to do that. I probably won't respond anymore because I need to focus on other stuff and I'm not sure that anything new will be said.",2017-07-06 19:02:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/6lnzc3/aita_for_continuing_to_argue_when_someone/,6lnzc3,36,30,0.92,0
59,asshole,AITA for rigging a raffle at work?,"I'm a supervisor at my job with a very strong union. Because of this we have attendance issues with many employees so to help with this, we have raffles on days that have historically low attendance such as the day before or after a holiday. We give everyone who came to work on time a ticket and our safety supervisor will draw 1 to determine he winner. This particular days prize was a bike with the company logo on it. Well I happened to walk in when she was drawing (she does it kind of privately) and I saw who the winner was. Well this particular gentleman has horrible attendance. Don't get me wrong, he is someone I would consider a friend so it's not like I have a grudge or anything but there are plenty of other hard working employees who deserve it more. So I told her that and I said don't pick him just pick someone else. So we had a little talk about who to pick and I couldn't think of anyone so I just redrew from the box and the next person was actually a great employee who didn't have a car and walked to work everyday. 

So my question is AITA here? I feel like I did the right thing and put the bike in the hands of someone who actually needed it and deserved it but I had to do it in a sneaky slimey way. 

Edit: Thanks for all the replies. I'm officially acknowledging I'm an asshole for this. However I'm not sorry for what I did and I know the person who got the bike is very grateful. I definitely won't be doing it again though",2017-07-10 06:10:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/6mco78/aita_for_rigging_a_raffle_at_work/,6mco78,34,62,0.97,0
60,asshole,AITA for accidentally selling a guitar amp,"We've been storing my GF's sister's Guitar and Amp and a few other knickknacks for a few months now, because GF's sis doesn't have space for it. My GF hates clutter and finally convinces her sis to sell stuff off. She sells what I think are the Guitar and Amp on craigslist but when the guy wants to come over she was already planning on going to the gym. So she asks me to come home early from work and meet up with the guy. It's a rush to get home, but all in all, no biggie. I give the guy the Guitar and Amp. He gives me the money, I think everything is great.

GF comes home and I tell her and immediately she's pissed at me. Apparently, she only sold the Guitar and not the Amp. The Amp had sentimental value for her sister and sis wanted to keep it. I get mad at her back for blaming me. I point out that they were sitting together in the closet and that they clearly looked like a set. GF had been wanting to clear out this closet and these were the last remaining things. Also, her sis lives across the country, had no plans to come get it, and what were we going to do with just an Amp? 

So I don't think it's my fault here, but as I'm typing this from the guest room aka doghouse it doesn't really feel that way. What do you guys think, reddit?

61,asshole,AITA for pointing out we are not close friends,"Alright, I'll preface this by saying I'm 99% sure I am the asshole here. We're both 21, i'm a guy, she's not if that makes any difference.

**Some light background reading:**

I have feelings for her, and she knows it. Her constant saying 'mate', and 'friend' feels a lot like she's just trying to rub it in that she doesn't like me that way. 

**The cracking story** 

I was talking to my friend, she said 'as a close friend you should know my every move' (as a joke, she's not a lunatic). I was a bit taken aback, so I said 'ok step back on close friend' and then continued on as normal. Didn't really think it'd be a big deal tbh. 

She was having none of that, said ""Oh so we're not close friends. Fine, ok"". So I explained why I thought this (below), and then she just said 'retracted', and 'i hope you're happy' (I mean obviously I'm not considering I'm a complete fucking loser and barely have any friends, which she basically knows). 

My reasoning to her was that I'm not in her top 50 friends so saying i'm a 'close friend' is an incredibly liberal use of the phrase, and I just don't agree with that. 

**Vague conclusion**

I'm pretty sure I am the asshole, but I'm not sure why to be honest, so could someone explain that to me. 

**Further**

I may have missed some VITAL piece of information, so let me know if there's any more you need to know.


Thanks,

62,asshole,AITA wanting mutual consideration?,"A lady friend I've known for over a year accompanied me to vacation resort (my treat) in June. She also agreed to accompany me on a road-trip to Montana in September. It had been 6 weeks since our last conversation (we're 900 miles apart) and when I sent a text a few days ago reminding her, she acted surprised to hear from me. She said she was working and will call me at 7:30p when she gets home. At 7:30 no call, 8:30 no call and I sent a text saying I'll call. No response, so at 9:30 I call a full voice-mail box. I didn't want to assume she was flaking on me so the next day (18 hours later) I sent a text wishing her luck with the emotional issue preventing her from calling me. 16 hours later, still no call but a text telling me I was judgmental because her cousin needed her more than calling me to ""catch up"". She also tells me everyone comes to her with their problems and she should charge for being a shrink. This is now two days after she said she would call me. I text her that there was nothing judgmental and I just wanted her to be considerate about keeping her word. I also told her if she's too busy, maybe we shouldn't remain friends. BOOM! She says I'm being a judgmental asshole to the only person willing to keep a decent relationship with me, and she was helping her cousin out with a problem so I can cram it up my ass! Huh?! Game over, I replied simply. Okay. 
If it makes any difference, it cost me $2.5K for her part of the vacation. I never said a word about it because I had a good time even though she friend-zoned me.",2017-09-04 20:09:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/6y2tex/aita_wanting_mutual_consideration/,6y2tex,23,14,0.79,0
63,asshole,AITA for syruping a poorly parked car,"For backstory, my apartment cannot handle its capacity. Internet, hot water, parking, you name it, when the apartment fills up, nobody gets enough of any of those. Parking is an especially big issue for me, since even though the apartment has a nice garage, they sold more parking passes than they have spaces. They also have a visitor lot, which tows aggressively if you don't pay. Needless to say, it's very important to me that I can get a parking space.

Well one night, this wasn't an option. It was 3am, I had just driven back and wanted to go the fuck to sleep. Circled the garage, all 3 and a half floors, completely occupied. But one occupant stood out above the rest. A nice silver generic sedan in two whole spaces. 

Now there's no way for me to get in contact with the owner, nobody gets their own assigned space, and since I wasn't gonna call a tow truck at 3am just to avoid paying for a few hours of parking, I did what any other disgruntled prick would do.

I parked my car in the visitor lot, paid, went home, grabbed a full bottle of maple syrup, went back to the garage, and went to town. It wasn't the whole car, mostly the door handles to make their hands sticky for the whole drive, and the windshield wipers, just so it'd take extra long for their windshield to clean up, but boy was it satisfying. To this day, there are still dark spots on the concrete where my art was previously parked.

He and her were laughing and talking the whole night. He tried to involve me a few times but I was getting upset so I didn't. We all played a few games together and he tapped her arm a few times to point out things (they were on the same couch together). I was crying by the end of it.

I told him about it and almost broke up with him over it. He acted like he didn't know what happened. I told him and he said ""what? In no way were we flirting we were just talking"". They both claim there wasn't flirting but they talked and laughed for like 3 hours together right in front of me.

65,asshole,AITA for saying I don't want to take responsibility for my exe's inability to effectively communicate?,"First let me say, I AM an asshole for a lot of stuff I did during the relationship. I was emotionally abusive  and didn't respect her space after the relationship. I have a lot of guilt to process and am now seeing a therapist (and soon a psychiatrist for other deep seeded issues).

Part of processing this crippling guilt for me has been trying to be realistic and practical about it. Mitigating it to what truly is my fault and not just taking the blame for EVERYTHING. Which is what I was originally doing. 

I was talking to my friend about this guilt. I was saying, I take responsibility for being emotionally abusive and not respecting my ex's space. I also said I DON'T have to take responsibility for her poor communication skills. 

My ex didn't effectively break up with me. I had to basically do the breakup because she couldn't just come out and say it. She spent two months distancing herself and not telling me what was wrong. It was hell for me and I can honestly say I have trauma from it. Also we were in an open relationship and she ommited that she had slept with someone else (something we had agreed to be truthful on). When we broke up she said a lot to make me think we could still have a future: ""things might work out"" etc.

Basically I was telling my friend that I don't have to take responsibility for those things. They damaged my self esteem and made moving on harder for me. I'm not going to feel guilty for her inability to communicate. 

My friend got mad at me, saying I should have known. She says my ex was afraid of how I would react. And I get that honestly. It makes sense. But it doesn't make leading me on right or less hurtful. And I certainly don't have to take responsibility for it. Relationships are a two way street and my ex CHOSE to stay with me (in fact she cried for us to stay together when we went long distance). I wasn't physically abusive, manipulative. I was just an asshole occasionally when I'd have a bad day. There was no ""if you leave"" type of threat. 

So as awful as I feel and despite all of this guilt I have to remember that I didn't force her to be with me. She wanted the relationship too. 

Am I the asshole?

66,asshole,AITA for getting upset with my girlfriend for hanging out with this guy,"Backstory: 3 years dating. Best friend type of relationship.  

So my gf recently started college. She is in an organization that had a bunch of other freshmen in it as well. So she's in this friend group of people, several girls and guys, who hang out, study, eat lunch, and do homework together. There's one dude in the group who has been subtly flirting with her (the guy is in a one year long relationship).  

Anyways, a few weeks into the semester, he invited her to his dorm to ""work on homework"" together that he was having trouble with. She didn't go obviously. They talk every once and a while, as friends do, but he invited her over a lot. He invited her over to watch a tv show earlier this week and it started an argument between us. He texted her this morning asking to go shopping with him to help pick out his gf an anniversary present, I told her it was ok to go if she had some other people tag along.   

So, she ended up going with another guy and girl as well. They all hung out a bit after and all went to his dorm to hang out. Once I found out she was there, I got upset with her for not telling me. I already didn't trust this guy and het going over there for a bit upset me. We argued for a bit and she told me she wouldn't talk to him anymore if I wanted that.

Its fun, we both enjoy ourselves (i make sure we both have a good time/orgasm), but she does comment that sometimes she wishes we would just cuddle and not go any further because that pushes her away from wanting to cuddle in the future unless she really wants to go all the way... anyways, as I'm stating that this should be seen as a huge compliment that i still find her attractive to want to have sex anytime I'm around her (because she has image problems, like i'd assume most women do after a child and gaining a ton of weight they don't want), this gal we work with comes over, says she overheard me, puts me on blast for treating my wife like a sex slave and that i'm a misogynist and that i don't treat my wife with respect... etc etc. I don't give two shits what this woman thinks, she doesn't effect my work atmosphere, so, thanks for your opinion. What i do care about is if she is right and i don't respect my wife as much as i can. Obviously more cuddles and such without the expectation of sex may be better, i just thought showing my wife how awesome she looks/is means more. Or something... Am i an asshole or just need to treat my wife differently/better? 

Edit: I spoke to my wife about this and the recommendations of Sarahmgray (thank you so much) and after a 3.5 hour conversation, really realized that, like many of you said, she feels more loved by being cuddled, having the candid conversations, such as what we were currently having, and the enjoyment of each others company.  Like I said eariler, I never push her to do anything she doesn't want to do, but out of the 4/5 times a week, she said that probably only 3 were what she really wanted to do, and the other times were for me, which she was happy to meet me there, but if I pulled back to a few times a week, and spent the other 2/3 times just cuddling on the couch or having conversation that didn't lead into sex, that would mean more than having sex.  So.  Look like I'm getting less sex, but building a significantly stronger relationship with my wife, which is a GREAT trade off :)  Thank you all for the opinions.  Never would have really realized to the extent that it was.  She has said some things, but it was never pushed because she felt it was unloving of her to push me away, which made me feel awful.  We talked about other stuff in our marriage, and I gotta say, really helped a lot guys.  Like I said before, we have a great marriage already, from both of our perspectives, but now, really feel like we will do so much better now, just with the more mutual understanding.

68,everyone sucks,AITA for calling a lady overweight in the checkout line?,"

I'm in line getting ready to buy some chewing tobacco. Now I know chewing tobacco is horrible for me, but some days I just need the little escape. 

Behind me is what can best be described as someone fitting the [Can I Speak to the Manager](https://i.imgur.com/D8Ftqal.jpg) profile. As I tell the cashier what I want, this lady loudly interjects in a condescending tone:
>There's no reason you should be buying that crap.  I have a friend who was addicted to that stuff and got mouth cancer.  It's moronic to keep buying something that will kill you.

I replied

>It's no worse than being obese from an eating addiction, but I'm not preaching to you to put back the junk food.

Her response, and hence the post was

>Asshole.

70,asshole,AITA for wanting a bathroom to myself?,"Tl;dr in the bolded lines

**So I moved into a big, old house a couple of months ago with two older dudes that I had never met before.** They're both from India, I'm from elsewhere in the U.S.. We're all on good terms, but not particularly close. We usually say hi to each other in passing, sometimes I give them rides to the grocery store. We're all graduate students at the nearby university, and rented rooms through a property company that owns houses in the area. It was one of the cheapest housing options , and for good reason – the house is pretty shitty. 

Even though there are a total of six bedrooms, **there are only two bathrooms – one on each floor**. They're pretty small as far as bathrooms go. **The two roommates got here a couple of months before me, and both took rooms upstairs. I took a room downstairs.** The bathroom was totally empty, so I quickly started filling it with my toiletries and towels. At the time, we weren't sure if there was going to be another person moving into the house, so I tried to take up minimal space in the cabinet and the small sink counter, in case I was going to have to share. Ultimately, we didn't get a 4th roommate, so I let my stuff expand. 

**We never actually had ""the conversation"" about bathrooms.** I kind of figured that it just sort of made sense that they would use the one upstairs and I would use the one downstairs. Presumably guests would also use mine. **I know it's not fair that they would have to share while I get one more or less all to myself, but I figured I lucked out with the arrangement.**

**Except, I've noticed in the last couple of months that I don't have it all to myself. My roommates frequently use my bathroom.** Sometimes just for a quick piss, sometimes for long shits >= 20 minutes, sometimes for the shower. One time in the morning when I was late for class, I went to use it and it was locked. I knocked on the door and no one answered. I asked ""Hello?"" and got nothing. I knocked again, and got a dazed reply of ""yeah?"". I guess he... fell asleep in there? They seem to wash their hands about half the time. When one of my roommates was sick, I noticed occasional phlegm piles in the sink and shower floor. Other than that, they leave it generally clean. And hell, I don't leave it particularly clean.

Clearly the best scenario would be to have a big open discussion about it, but none of us are big discussers, and I'd rather not bring it up if I'm not in the right. **Is it assholish of me to expect that I should get the bathroom to myself?**

Edit: Sounds like I'm the asshole! Fair, I have no right to think of it as my personal facility. ",2017-11-03 14:35:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/7ajrml/aita_for_wanting_a_bathroom_to_myself/,7ajrml,10,40,0.95,0
71,asshole,WIBTA if I ended a friendship because I didn't like the other people my friend was hanging out with?,"Recently I have gotten back in touch with one of my friends, and in that time she has made a lot of new friends, though she claims that I'm still her best friend. That being said, she and I don't have as much time together now, since we're both much busier, and I'm well aware that she spends far more time with these friends than me. I've already mentioned to her that, while I don't like most of these friends and don't want to be included in their group, that she is completely free to remain friends with them and I don't want to get in their way whatsoever. 
Still, she's been trying to make me interact with them instead of just letting it be, in an attempt to make me become friends with her group. Though it seems to me that she has a very close group of friends, she still makes me feel guilty about a fight in the past, and how she couldn't survive without me. Would I be the asshole if I broke off our friendship now, knowing that she'll probably be hurt if I did?",2017-11-06 03:38:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/7b2m7f/wibta_if_i_ended_a_friendship_because_i_didnt/,7b2m7f,5,6,0.88,0
72,asshole,AITA for making a joke referencing black people leaving stickers on hats,"On Halloween we were going out on a haunted city tour, and it was cold, so I grabbed the first hat from the closet.


The hat still had the sticker on it, because I had not work it yet before.
I had recently watched the ""Key and Peele - Dueling hats"" video.

so on the wy up there, I said: ""Do I need to take the sticker off this hat, or can I go as a black guy for Halloween"".

My girlfriend started arguing that I was being incredibly racist, and she didn't even know who I was anymore.

I asked her to tell me what specifically about the joke was racist, since I thought it was just making a comment on a cultural concept, not mocking or denigrating it.

( Note - I am white )

So, unbiased people of the internet - Am I the Asshole?

Thanks for all the comments people.

73,asshole,AITA for finding humor in controversial topics?,"My best friend and I tend to share opinions on most controversial/hot button/political topics. We have recently come into conflict on how we approach our opinions though. 

My friend is very passionate about topics like these, and reads up on them frequently. If she gets started, she can talk for hours about these topics, and she is very quick to stand up for what she thinks is right.

I, on the other hand, am a lot more lax on these kind of things. My style of jokes tend to involve a lot of sarcasm, satire, and black humor. It's what I grew up with. I rarely read up on many of the current headlines as I'm not interested in politics, and I'm more involved in issues that are closer to myself. 

More and more recently, my friend has been calling me out on my humor, following up with many lectures as to why what I said was wrong or offensive. I was beginning to feel attacked, so I decided to address the situation. 

I explained to her that when she calls me out like that, it makes me feel like I'm a terrible person for having those views, and that it was hurtful, and I suggested that we try to avoid these types of topics in future conversations in order to not put any more strain on our friendship. We do get along real well otherwise. 
I admit some of my wording may have not been the best as I described to her what I meant, suggesting that she was oversensitive and obsessed with making things PC. 

Her reply was to tell me that if I felt like a bad person because of my views, that I could change. She then went on to point out some of the things I've said in the past that have hurt her. She then called me selfish and bigoted (the latter an insult that has really been bothering me.).

Nothing was concluded from our conversation, and she ended it telling me that she was glad we had this talk. 

The few times I have seen her since this specific conversation, she has acted like nothing has happened. I personally feel reluctant to continue our friendship. 

Am I the asshole?

74,asshole,AITA for having disputes with my ex about changing her appearance?,"So there’s a bit of a backstory required here.

My (now ex) girlfriend and I decided to break up about 3 months ago due to distance and diverging trajectories. (She’s South African, going from strength to strength teaching at high school in Cape Town, while I’m from the UK, here in Europe trying to figure out wtf to do with my life while teaching English abroad). 

We spent over a year together, and for 6 months I was living with her in Cape Town. We generally got on great, but, as is normal, would occasionally have a difference of opinion and, quite rarely, a confrontation. 

I’m really quite introverted, and hate conflict, while she is an out and out extrovert and enjoys discussing ideas openly. She would tell me, or anyone else, if she didn’t agree with something or saw injustice. (She’s also a bona fide feminist, which is important). Sometimes I admired her for this, but sometimes I resented her and saw it as misguided moral crusading. (e.g. Pulling me up for calling a cigarette a ‘fag’. I’m from the UK, that’s my lingo ffs.)

Aaaanyway, one of our biggest disputes was when she wanted to change her hairstyle. She liked changing her look, had a few minor piercings, and was very into her appearance. (I am too, but I dress and look quite conservative, i.e. no tattoos, piercings. Edit: I once blurted out that I would have reconsidered dating her if she’d had a septum piercing when we met, after she told me she’d considered getting one. Tbh I think they’re horrible, and a banal fashion statement.) So one day she told me she wanted braids, and so we went to buy extensions.

On the way I started to feel weird about it, similar to when she suddenly decided she would get another piercing. When I asked her why she got irritated with me and asked ‘What’s with the interrogation??’ I don’t really know why, but I felt uncomfortable, sort of like there was some kind of power struggle brewing beneath the surface. I ultimately confessed that I liked her hair as it was (true) and didn’t know why she wanted to change it. She did have some kind of complex about her hair, as curly ‘african’ hair comes with a lot of baggage re identity, especially in SA. 

In the end, she didn’t change her hair and we didn’t talk much more about it. I felt weird and guilty for feeling so put out by what seemed something so trivial. I thought I was doing right by being honest. 

The reason her feminism is important is because I was always very aware that things like this could quickly become an ‘issue’. I was perfectly aware she could have seen me as a controlling arsehole putting limits on how she could look, and I was on her turf and vastly outnumbered by her friends and family. 

Fast forward to now. We’re still talking occasionally on whatsapp, post break up. Recently things have become a bit more fiery, and we’re arguing a lot more. So yesterday she sends me a photo of her with braids captioned ‘going out’. I say ‘oh new hair!’ She says ‘yeah, the hair you freaked out about 😂’. I just tell her I prefer it natural (still true; I just find braids can be a bit scraped and tacky). I’m not sure whether this is her getting over me or something, but my feelings haven’t changed since we were together.

Since then I’ve been inordinately annoyed. I feel weird and guilty, and I can’t get the whole thing out of my mind. It may seem trivial but it’s the implications of the dispute which are gnawing at me. Am I really a controlling arsehole? Are my ideas of dating old fashioned? Is it me who has to change? Why do I feel so strongly about it?? 

So, Reddit, please: am I the arsehole? 

(For what it’s worth I frequently told her she is beautiful, and she is. I don’t think she needs to change.)

Edit: Eh, thanks for providing your thoughts everyone, I suppose. I have been branded ‘asshole’ so the message is clear. (Though it sounds nicer than ‘arsehole’ so there’s that.)

For those who were wondering not much really was said at the time beyond me telling her I liked her hair as it was. My question was more about my internal reaction to the situation, and trying to figure out why I felt strangely about it. This only came up again after months when she messaged me last week. We haven’t spoken much since then.

Anyway, it’s been a humbling experience reddit. I’ve clearly got some attitude issues to work on. I hope we can still be friends 😬. ",2017-12-02 11:21:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/7h259v/aita_for_having_disputes_with_my_ex_about/,7h259v,34,10,0.86,0
75,asshole,AITA for not reaching out/apologising to my friend?,"I will refer to my two friends as E and J. I apologise in advance as this is quite a long one.

 
First, a little backstory:

 
E, J and I have been friends for around 6 years. We were a trio up until E and J fell out about 6 months ago. The reason they fell out was a whole other drama in itself, but basically can be summarised as E being unhappy that J was ‘ditching us’ for a new boyfriend. In actuality, J had only asked to rearrange a girls night so she could see her boyfriend that night instead. The whole thing was blown out of proportion and as a result, E no longer wanted to speak to J, but I stayed friends with J because… well, why wouldn’t I? I know they had a big falling out over messenger in which some pretty harsh comments were thrown back and forth, but I made it clear to them both that I wasn’t going to take sides.

 
Fast forward to last Friday night. As I said, I’m still friends with both E and J even if they won’t talk. If I’m honest, I’ve always been closer with E and she lives in the same town as me, so I have spent more time with her in the 6 months since the trio broke up. However, it was J’s birthday last week which I wasn’t able to attend, so I invited her to my flat for a takeaway and drinks.

 
A little into the night, J told me her dad had died earlier in the week. J had a weird relationship with her dad; she was basically raised by her grandparents and rarely saw either of her parents, but he was still her dad so she had some very mixed emotions about it. We discussed it a little, but almost as quickly as J had brought it up, she changed the topic.

 
A short while later, I went to the bathroom and when I did, I sent E a message letting her know what had happened to J’s dad. E and J have had fallings out in the past, but part of what always brought them back together was when one reached out to the other after some emotional event that made them forget their falling out. I will admit at this point, I was being selfish in hoping I could get the two of them talking again. I also felt E ought to know, and that it might make her realise how insignificant their falling out was in the first place. *This is where I first evaluate my Asshole Status.* In retrospect, if J had wanted E to know about her dad, I’m sure she would have told her herself. I am an Emotional Drunk, but I can’t 100% use that as my excuse.

 
At first, E and I exchanged empathetic comments and she seemed 100% ready to forget about what had happened and reach out to J herself. However, at this point in the evening J and I made the decision to pick up some more alcohol so we left my flat. In the 20 minutes it took to go to the shop and back, I returned to a tirade of messages from E.

Here’s the message trail: https://imgur.com/gallery/mf7rt

 
At this point I confessed to J that I had told E about her dad. J asked to read over the messages, which she did. Her feelings were she had no interest in E reaching out to her and was annoyed that, in her words, E felt that I shouldn’t be hanging out with other people. J asked me not to give E her number. Frankly after the messages E sent me, I had no intention of giving her J’s number anyway. We continued to enjoy the rest of our night until J went home.

 
Mine and E’s conversation ends at my last two messages. Neither of us have said anything since Friday night. I’m conflicted, because I have a bad habit of taking 100% of the blame in situations like these and part of me wants to message her again with another, more in depth apology. At the same time, I feel E has blown this out of proportion just like she did to J 6 months ago, and I’m hurt by the comments she made about the two former friends who I no longer have any contact with (I haven’t for several years, so I feel like E was reaching to make that dig at me).

 
So, *am I the asshole*? Should I just suck it up and reach out to E, or am I right to feel she overreacted?

**EDIT: Thank you everyone for your comments. I seriously appreciated all of them, the “yes” and the “nos”.**

After considering everyone’s advice, I made the decision to send E and J two separate apologies.

I apologised (via messenger) to E for putting her in a shitty situation, and let her know I had passed her condolences on to J. I also said I couldn’t force her and J to be friends and I would be more mindful of that moving forward. No response yet. 🤞🏻

I apologised to J for telling E about her dad without her permission. To be honest we’d already discussed it on Friday night, but we were drunk and I wanted to send her something more sincere. She said she was surprised I brought it up again and that she was completely fine with the situation. So it seems like it’s only me still dwelling on the situation, ha.

Thanks again everyone. I’m leaving this post up as per the rules but I’ve removed the imgur link, because I’m a paranoid bitch.",2017-12-12 13:54:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/7jaug5/aita_for_not_reaching_outapologising_to_my_friend/,7jaug5,16,48,0.93,0
76,asshole,AITA for using a shitty ex-roommate’s Hulu?,"I lived with this girl for five months in 2013. We will call her A. I thought she was my friend, but once I moved in she became toxic and basically started emotionally abusing me. If I wasn’t home when she got home from work, she would bombard me with calls and texts until I came home. She would break into my room and cry into my pillows when I wasn’t home. She would leave without notice for a week at a time, never arranging for someone to watch her dogs and cats (meaning I had to do it or the apartment would be destroyed). She lied about having cancer when she noticed me pulling away from her. She let her boyfriend move in without paying rent or utilities. She removed the pipes from the kitchen sink when we got into an argument. All the bills were in her name and I came home one day to all the utilities cut off, meaning none of the money I set aside for bills ever actually got used for bills. She began to hoard animals and acquired six snakes and three cats in the five months I lived with her. She threw tantrums if any of my things were in our shared spaces. I had to walk on eggshells 24/7 and moved out suddenly to escape her. 

During my time living with her she logged into Hulu on my Roku and never logged out. I still use her Hulu because a) I don’t want to pay for it and b) I see it as a harmless way to tell her to shove it without her ever knowing. I told a friend about this and they told me I was being an asshole.

77,asshole,AITA if I don't want to work physically with my father and uncle tomorrow instead of trying to find a different job?,"First time posting on this sub.

I'm 20M, and have been struggling to find a job ever since my summer job ended in August. I've put in applications, and no callbacks, nothing. Both sides of my family (parents are divorced) are getting mad at me, calling me lazy. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and I'll admit it's starting to get to me, but hopefully someone will offer me something soon. I seriously do want a job, even if it's only to get the complaining to stop.

Bit of background info. As mentioned, parents are divorced. Father was found to be doing some shady crap to screw my mother out of money (selling his landscaping/snow removal business to his brother (my uncle), acting like he's broke when he's obviously not, etc.) and refusing to help with college. And, I still hate him for it. Don't really like going over his house, or anything to do with him.

Fast-forward to tonight. Taking a shower, and my mother knocks and comes in, and suddenly tells me that tomorrow, I'm going to help my father and uncle shovel snow, and that she told him I'd be ready early in the morning, without even asking me first.

I told her no, I'm not helping them, that it's not because I don't want a *job*, it's because I don't want to help *them*, and that I'd go around tomorrow and put more applications in. 

I'm honestly trying to get something together, and people may think I'm lazy because there's something right in front of me and I refuse to take it...but it's a personal reason. I just don't want to help my father and uncle.

79,asshole,AITA for not caring in the slightest that I'm probably going to get fired.,"I'm probably going to get fired because I had a final writeup for not ""properly closing the safe"" which translates to, I closed and locked it, but because i didn't turn the knob far enough, you could technically open it if you quick went back to the right number. Final writeup means if you get written up again it's termination. I'm likely going to get written up because today I read my schedule wrong and thought I worked tomorrow, but i was supposed to open today. No call no show means writeup means termination.

Why don't i care?

I've worked for this company on and off for a year. I worked my way up to the management team and then they started treating me like shit. I was told to skip a friends funeral because my coworker/manager wanted to do some wedding planning. I worked during his funeral. Just recently, they called me and asked me to work a 13 hour, no break day because same coworker/manager didn't want to come in when the other manager got the flu. These are 2 major instances in a sea of smaller things. The treatment is garbage. I regularly feel that they don't see me as a person, but as some sort of customer service bot that can come in whenever they don't want to do stuff. I'm a student, I'm involved in campus organizations, i have a life.

81,asshole,AITA for insisting that my girlfriend tell me something she’s been keeping from me?,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for about three years now (non-consecutive as we broke up for a while last year), and recently I was bored and went through her old twitter posts because I usually find things that sounded nerdy/dorky (we both do this) and I think it’s funny. One of her posts said “Do you ever feel like you fucked something up that was really good? Yeah me too.” It was posted a month after we had broken up so I was curious if it was about me. I asked her what it was she fucked up and she said it’s none of my business. 

We’re both usually extremely open and honest about everything so this really surprised me. So I said “If it’s about another guy or something I’m fine with that, I’m just curious what it was you felt like you fucked up.” Long story short we ended up doing this back and forth thing where she said it’s not a big deal and I would say if it’s not a big deal then why are you keeping it from me yadayadayada. Eventually she told me that she was thinking about dating another guy but decided not to. I told her okay thank you for telling me, it isn’t a big deal and it doesn’t bother me. 

Then the real shit show happened. She started calling me ridiculous and dramatic and that I should just trust that if she isn’t telling me then it’s not a big deal, and that anything that happened when we were broken up is none of my business and she’s not obligated to tell me. I responded by saying that she is someone I’m interested in marrying within the next couple years, and I can’t be comfortable making that decision if I feel like she’s keeping things from me, especially when I’m always open with her when asked about my past. I also said that she shouldn’t keep things from me or tell my things just because she is or isn’t obligated to do so. If she feels like she can’t be open with me about something that small, I feel like there’s bigger things she’s keeping from me and I don’t want to feel that way about someone I love and trust more than anyone. 

Was I being ridiculous/an asshole for pushing her to tell me something she didn’t want to tell me? Was I right to feel like she was being sketchy?

TL;DR: My girlfriend of three years was keeping a detail of her past (from when we were broken up) from me. I asked her to be open about it and she said it’s none of my business. Turned out it was about a guy, no big deal. She said I was ridiculous, I said she was acting sketchy and I felt like she wasn’t earning my trust.

84,asshole,AITA for not paying for a damage of a plastic panel,"Sorry for long post and no to:dr as there’s too much context 

So basically me and this guy hate each other because of a lot of things. However, we are passive aggressive till recently. During the incident, he said my Co curriculum activity was shit, and I replied that if they produce someone like you then they are also bad. Before that we had an oral test in front of class. He gave a thumbs down which I interpreted him as being salty as he didn’t do very well. Going back to my reply, then he said some profanities while I continued saying that is this what your parents taught you? Using parents as a tool to provoke him without swearing while he was screaming profanities profusely. Then there was this other guy who were friends with both of us and witnessed everything above, I whispered to him that he is probably salty about the test shit. Then he was so angry he took my water bottle and threw it against the plastic panel which broke (but not my water bottle) 

After that we had a talk with our teachers which resulted in us being friends again but then because I was held back for this even though I didn’t damage any property, my mother came down and had a talk with my form tutor. Finally it ended with her saying she wanted an email from the teacher following this incident  or if possible a phone call from the guys parents (he was known for having a horrible temper last year, being violent after provoked the slightest, it isn’t so bad now) however till now she hasn’t emailed at all.

The next day the teacher asked him to pay $60 but never message me to pay $30 which was half of the cost. We agreed to pay 50% each during The talk. Then my mother doesn’t give me the money because she needed the email to say like whatever. Throughout the teacher didn’t message me or email me about the cost at all, only messaging the other guy.  Now we are no longer friends because he shouted I need to change my bad habit which was discussed during our talk . I felt he was hypocritical as he was over exaggerating, another thing we talked about.

Now my friend is blaming me because I’m not paying for the window as the guy only paid half . I explained to him that it was because my mom didn’t allow and that there could be something else we didn’t know about and that’s the reason why the teacher didn’t say that I needed to pay. He said he wanted to go ask on my behalf but I told him not to because there could be a reason. Then now he’s angry and is giving me the cold shoulder. I feel that although it concerns you as it results in poor air flow, it is none of your business not to do anything at all about this. Another friend was also with him but after that he was okay and didn’t care much . That is the type of personality I respect as although he may feel I should have paid, he didn’t really care and continued to be friends. (Note that all the friends are different people) so am I the asshole for not paying for it ?

85,asshole,AITA for being annoyed that my in-laws only take my nephew to see “important” superhero movies?,"Everyone in this situation is you’re basic white suburban folks.

 I’ve been a big comic book fan forever and have seen every comic book movie to date in the theater, usually on opening weekend. My wife and I (we’re child free by choice) have a nephew (he’s 11 now) who was into superheroes as a really little kid. Especially Iron Man. But he had never seen a modern superhero movie outside of the first two X-Men movies, so that means no DCEU, and no MCU. 

But his parents, my in-laws, *have* since taken him to see Wonder Woman and Black Panther. But like, only those two. 

Now, I’m a big whiny rainbow flag waving libtard. I’m right there with the rest of the “libtards” and bleeding hearts cheering on more diverse leads in these movies. But I also think that my nephew’s parents are teaching him that diversity is more important than if a movie is something you actually like by doing things this way.

Like I said, I champion diversity, but I don’t think you should go see something just because of the diversity. Go see something because you like it. My wife is a hardcore feminist, but she didn’t want to see Wonder Woman because she just finds the DCEU characters mostly boring. She found Suicide Squad a bit more interesting because it wasn’t the same old boring Batman or Superman bullshit she’s seen a hundred times. But when other women, including her sister in law heard she hadn’t seen WW, they made her feel like a “bad feminist”. Can’t someone just not want to see a movie because it doesn’t look good to them, while still cheering that it got made and did well?

The thing that really bothers me is that I think my nephew would really enjoy the other Marvel movies. And it’s not like they haven’t taken him or shown them to him because the movies are too white or too male dominated. Its traditionally been because he’s been too young for them in their opinions, which is fine. But now it’s fine I guess? Well my personally mission is to get the caught up by Infinity War.",2018-03-11 05:26:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/83kv2o/aita_for_being_annoyed_that_my_inlaws_only_take/,83kv2o,53,37,0.74,0
86,asshole,AITA for telling someone with a mental disorder to butt out of my personal conversation,"There's this girl at my school who is a pretty huge outcast. She's pretty attractive, so it has nothing to do with her appearance and everything to do with her personality. 

She has the bad habit of interrupting other people's conversations if she hears something that catches her interest and then will just completely dominate the conversation by talking about facts no one cares about. She's really annoying and kind of weird.

Anyways, my friend and I were sitting in the back of the classroom and talking/joking around a bit and she walks up to us and just starts talking about something we had been discussing earlier. I have a cold and didn't really feel that well, so I was pretty annoyed already and told her it was ""an A and B conversation, so C your way out of it."". She didn't seem that hurt, but she went quiet and just kind of left.

Later after class, her ""friend"" pulled me aside and told me that I was an asshole because she has autism and I was being rude. I told her that I didn't know she had autism, but even if she did, then it was no excuse for her to be treated any differently than a normal person. 

So, am I the asshole for treating someone with autism the same way I would treat a normal person?",2018-03-15 23:26:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/84r10s/aita_for_telling_someone_with_a_mental_disorder/,84r10s,14,14,0.85,0
87,asshole,AITA? Was my brother an asshole at the movie theatre?,"So a somewhat distant family member has been in the hospital with many issues, namely blood clots that have left her paralyzed for the rest of her life. For a period of time, we actually thought she might be close to death, and my brother had been getting updates periodically via text message.  One such text message came while we all happened to be at a movie.  He read the text message, passed the phone to my mom to show her, and she passed the phone to me to see it too.  Normally, I am very strict on myself about looking at my phone at the movie theatre, but given the circumstances, I quickly read the message, turned off the screen, and passed it back to my brother.

An older man who had been sitting behind us (and loudly whispering nonstop during the movie) approached us after the movie was over and said,  ""I'm glad you guys were able too check your messages in the middle of the movie.""  Now, part of me understands his point.. I, too, HATE it when people in front of me look at their phone, although I typically don't actually go out of my way to say anything to them.  So I get it, but I was still taken aback by him actually saying something.

My brother explained to him; ""I'm sorry, but we have a family member in the hospital, and that message was just to give us some new details.""  If I were the old man, I might have gotten embarrassed and said something like, ""Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that,"" and then left.  But the old man (who, mind you, was talking all throughout the movie) decided to keep going, even after learning of the dilemma.  ""Well, I'm just saying, it was very distracting.""  My brother, already upset about the details of the text message, had no patience, and promptly responded with, ""Oh shut up and get the fuck out of here, you old asshole.""  The man smirked, and high-tailed it out of there.",2018-03-19 21:29:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/85n8ng/aita_was_my_brother_an_asshole_at_the_movie/,85n8ng,23,16,0.95,0
88,everyone sucks,AITA for ranting/complaining to my mom about issues I have with my sisters when our mom turns around and yells at them for it?,"My sisters can be very inconsiderate and selfish. I'm not going to distinguish between them much for the sake of simplicity which I know isn't completely fair, but they seem to have the same problem with the fact that I complain to our mom about frustrating things *they've* done such as: 

* letting an un-vaccinated stray kitten use my cat's litter box and leaving the spilled dirty litter all over my bedroom floor without cleaning it

* putting a puppy who I had crated in the living room in my bedroom while I was asleep with my cat and another dog who are afraid of/aggressive toward him

* ignoring me or yelling at me when I ask them not do do things like: 

1. feed the puppy around a food-aggressive dog  

2. leave the doors open so my cat can slip outside and potentially get hurt by loose dogs or speeding cars 

3. give my cat can-opened cans of tuna when she could cut her tongue on the sharp edges, etc.

I tend to lightly ask my sisters not to do things like this. They often ignore me or don't take me seriously and continue to do these things. In the past, when I've confronted them, they've immediately gotten defensive and/or blown up on me. If my light suggestions don't do anything and my more serious confrontations end in screaming matches, I find it difficult and impossible to try to talk to them about any issue I have.

So I rant. I rant to my mom, my boyfriend, and an online friend I have. My mom is quite aware of my sisters' inconsiderate behavior. She also yells a lot. Because I feel like my sisters ignore me and I can't talk to them without a screaming match, ranting to my mom and such is the only way I feel I can get my frustration out. I feel like venting is a natural thing to do when somebody's annoyed you and ignored you.

However, my mom then immediately calls up my sisters and yells at them, using what I've told her they've done as fuel, even though I don't ask her to. 

My mom is so bad about this that when I was struggling with a falling out with a friend I made in college, I told her about what I was going through, and she literally wrote that friend a nasty letter even though I never asked her to intervene. That friend came to me upset thinking I had told my mom to write her that letter, and I had to explain to her I had no idea what she was talking about and apologized that my mom had done that, then had to ask my mom why the hell she'd done that, etc.

Now my sisters, instead of apologizing for the things they've done to frustrate me, have a grudge against me since they get chewed out by my mom. 

Yesterday after another incident one sister told me that she and my other sister are positive that I *want* them to get in trouble, that I want my mom to do my ""dirty work"" for me, and that I'm not ranting to get out my frustrations, I'm obviously scheming because I like that they get chewed out. 

They think my mom gives me preferential treatment and babies me (ignoring the fact that my mom definitely yells at me too, just not because of things I've done to annoy my sisters, because I largely stay out of my sisters' way, *and* the fact that I try my best not to do inconsiderate shit which means I get yelled at less.)

Both sisters have said to me ""If you have a problem, you should come talk to me about it instead of getting mom to yell at us for you"", seemingly unaware of the fact that I *have* talked to them, politely suggested they not do these things that frustrate me multiple times and if I do actually confront them about a repeated issue it's going to end in them yelling at me. And I don't ask my mom to yell at them. Ever.

One sister thinks I should save ranting about them to my friends and that it's wrong for me to rant to my mom because of how she reacts. (As if she never, ever rants to my mom about things me or my other sister have done.)

I don't rant to my close in-person friends (except my bf) about the assholish things my sisters do because I don't want my friends to think badly of them. My mom is already aware of how inconsiderate they are sometimes, and she herself has dealt with their selfish actions (such as taking needed clothes and toiletries without asking and getting defensive when questioned about it, letting our family dogs and house get infested with fleas brought from her dog, etc.)

Since I know my mom is like this and will turn around and chew them out even if I ask her not to, am I the asshole for complaining to her about what they do at all? Am I subconsciously hoping they get yelled at whenever I do?

Again, I don't ask my mom to yell at them on my behalf, ever. She chooses to. She has said stuff like 'I'm going to talk to them' when I vent my frustrations, but ""talk"" doesn't mean ""immediately call them up and scream at them using my complaints as fuel to the point where they get upset and send me nasty messages"". 

I even brought up the fact to one sister that they've both ignored or blown up on me when I've tried to talk to them personally about issues, and she just dismisses it and deflects blame.

91,no assholes here,AITA for doing my final year uni project more than seeing my girlfriend ?,"AITA Me and my girlfriend are both in our final year of uni. Been together for a year and 5 months that have been so sick. I lost my dad a couple years ago to cancer and she has been a literal rock when it would have been so easy to walk away. The love is real

I have a 10,000 word politics dissertation due on May 8, of which I have about 4,000 words finished and 1,000 words in the editing process. I'm feeling good about it, I have no concerns about the length of time yet as I already have all my notes, it's just a matter of turning them into an essay. My girlfriend does chemistry and so has lots more smaller things due in, whereas mine makes up 1/3rd of my year.

Thing is we have very different working styles. We walk into the library each morning for around 9/9.30am and she has one break (lunch) and then likes to leave around 6pm. I like to stay until about 9/10pm and take lots of small breaks throughout the day (mainly cigs with friends). She says we aren't spending enough time together which I totally get, and that she doesn't understand why I would rather spend time with other friends than her. Like why do I go out to smoke or chill instead of finishing what I want to do that day and get home ASAP which is definitely her approach. I feel like the difference is I don't expect her to adopt my style of working, because I know it doesn't work for her.

Thing is, I know this is how I work best. Even at school and before I smoked a bit I always preferred to do a long slog with small breaks, rather than a really really intense day. Our styles of working are just completely opposite, but part of me doesn't want to sacrifice my dissertation and style of work especially when it's so close to being over. however, I do agree we aren't spending so much time together. But I also feel like that's to be expected: it's the final term of our final year of uni, no one is prioritising their social life ?

93,asshole,AITA for shooting my neighbors dog with a BB gun.,"This happened in August my neighbors had this white pit bull but weren't ever home to watch or take care of her. So she would wonder into our yard for food and after a while she would end up staying in our hard. So in our hard we have a basketball court and I would go out there alot to find that she was sitting there and would refuse to leave. And on top of that I think she had some kind of disease because she would take a dump everywhere and the ball would bounce in it all the time. So to make sure she didn't come back I started to bring my BB gun out. At first I would shoot warning shots, then after like a week she stopped being afraid of them. So I started to shoot close to her. She eventually got brave and wasnt afraid of those anymore. Then one day I had to shoo her away again. And I accidentally shot her. I felt no remorse and still don't feel remorse I would do it again. She came over a few more times after that but I dont remember ever shooting her again because as soon as I went for the BB gun she would run off. One day she went and hopped into somebodies car and I never saw her again thankfully (the persons car she jumped into was one of her owners cousins).
So that's the story so AITA for shooting my neighbors dog.

PS. Sometimes she would run into our yard at full speed like she was chasing something but nothing would be there and she would run in circles and off into someone else's yard.

My DD told her cousin this, who proceeded to tell her mother this, and I woke up this morning to a ""what is your problem with me"" text. Great, I thought, but figured NBD, I'll explain and she will get it. 

Instead she decided to spew a ton of venom (will link texts if you want, but someone will have to tell me how, lol!) And accuse me of all sorts of stuff I had no idea she had an issue with. Apparently my SIL has been harboring a grudge for some time.

Anyways, AITA? I probably should have never told my DD that, but I didn't think of it as ""talking shit"". If SIL would have asked of she could go, instead of going thru the kids, I would have told her the same damn  thing.
Im pretty upset about this; I always thought I had a good relationship with my SIL. 

Btw I live on the west coast, it's legal(as long as you aren't driving, etc) and I don't give two shits if you smoke weed. You just aren't driving my kid around while you are high.

95,asshole,AITA for making someone pay for their service even though it didn't go completely as planned?,"I'm a manager at a movie theater. One of my employees was selling tickets, and someone wanted to view a 3d showing of avengers but my employee hit the wrong button on accident and gave him a different movie. 3d showings of films are $3 more than normal films. The guest saw that he got the wrong thing and went into 3d avengers anyways. This stuff happens all the time, we call them swaps, and I do at least a dozen a day just because some kind of error usually happens.

When a movie has had no tickets sold for it, the computer after 15 minutes automatically stops playing because it doesn't need to. The guy was the only person in the 3d avengers and since he didn't actually buy it because the computer thought he got the movie the employee gave him on accident it shut itself off. So he asked for me to fix it, and I saw it had no seats sold so I asked to see his ticket. He gave it to me, I saw it was a different movie and not what he was watching, and I said I can fix it I just need to charge the extra 3 dollars because this is 3d. So he gave me his card, I did the swap and put the 3 dollar upcharge on it and gave it back.

After it was done he came out saying I treated him like a highschooler (he was probably in his 60s), and said he was gonna file a complaint about me. I explained that I was just fixing the mistake our employee had made because things happen like that around here, but he didn't care.

To summarize, guests asks for x and gets y on mistake, x is more expensive, he inquired as to why the thing he purchased isn't working, and then I fix it but only by adding on the difference in price x is from y. It definitely is our bad that we gave him the wrong thing and said he was ok at first, but I don't see the problem with charging him for what he wanted and not another item.",2018-05-17 08:06:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/8k2kji/aita_for_making_someone_pay_for_their_service/,8k2kji,17,4,0.7,0
96,everyone sucks,AITA for using toilet paper my roommate technically paid for?,"So I've been subletting from this dude and we have a weird dynamic. I've been subletting for the past two months, but I started halfway of last month and still paid for the entire month because I figured it was petty to pay a half month's rent even though we met halfway through the month. And now in 6 days the second month is over and the sublet will be over. 

We don't have any guests or anything. I do all the cleaning, but since he lives in his room I'm also the one making the messes. It was a 2 month sublet so his stuff is like 97% and I contributed with a few pots and plates of my own. 

Anyway today I go to the bathroom and the toilet paper is gone. Mind you for nearly the past 2 months I had bought my own toilet paper and was using it, and I only use a few squares at a time, but I had used mine up and was starting to use his because I hadn't had time to go to the store to get some more.

97,asshole,AITA for placing deliberately unreasonable conditions on a loan I don't want to give?,"Jenna has been a friend of mine for years. We've not been terribly close, but we know each other well enough. She's a very attractive woman, though nothing ever happened between us.  

She is notoriously bad with money. In the past she borrowed money from me, insisted she'd pay it back, avoided me, and then never mentioned it again. Now I didn't bring it up again after that, except for the time I'm going to tell you about, but I did mentally blacklist her from getting a loan from me again.  

So a few weeks ago she begged me to front her $500 because she needed to pay a bill, but assured me she would pay me back without fail. I responded that I didn't have that kind of money available to loan out. She wouldn't let it go asking when I got paid, asking if I had it in savings, asking if I could take a cash advance on a credit card and promising I'd pay no interest because she'd get me everything back before the due date.  I brought up that she hadn't paid me back previously, and she simply said she'd add it on to this loan and pay me back in full.  

I decided to call her bluff. I informed her that I would loan her the money provided that she would put up collateral. When she asked what she could put up, I responded the clothes off her back. I informed her that if she didn't pay me back on time, she would, at my request, strip down to nothing; not more than once a week, until she was fully paid up.  

She flat out refused, calling me disgusting and a pervert. I responded, ""But Jenna, you're going to pay me back before a single cent of interest needs to be paid, right? This shouldn't even be an issue!""  

She's since gone to several mutual friends and said that I propositioned her in her time of need and was trying to take advantage. Some friends, who have gotten burned as well, sympathize and understand why I set that condition. Others are not talking to me because they feel I'm taking advantage.

99,asshole,AITA for wanting someone to not listen to an artist (who recently died) when she had previously shamed people for listening to him ?,"ima be real with you chief, the artist is lil peep. i know this is corny, but i’ve been a fan of his forever and his music means a lot to me. This girl had called peeps‘ music „weird“ , „dumb“ and she had made fun of people who listened to him , telling them to slit their wrists , kill themselves , etc. (not me specifically but some of my acquaintances). 

a couple days ago she posted a screenshot of one of peeps songs , and talked about how she was still „heartbroken“ even though when news of his death first came out she had made statements like „emo kid finally killed himself“. 

Am i an asshole for wanting her to not listen to him? i hate gatekeepers , and i don’t have a problem with people who started listening to him after he died, but i hate so so much that she’s listening to him now.

100,asshole,AITA Minor offenses (I feel) end a 4 year long friendship,"So it all started when I tossed a retracted x-acto knife (I made sure it was safe before I sent it on its way) past my friend who doesn't like having things thrown or tossed at/near her. She says it triggers her PTSD which is understandable, so I apologized and said I would try to avoid throwing or tossing harmless objects at her.

Apparently this offense stressed her so badly that she ended up crying over it and was incredibly afraid and belittled because I chuckled at her flinching and anger towards me for tossing the x-acto blade handle at her.

Then 2 weeks later I had came back with her DS that I had borrowed and left finger nail marks in the analog stick which I said I would fix, but she was having none of that because it would break warranty and said she would just buy a new one. On my way out I was swinging the plastic bag it was in to and fro, like I do when you're standing idly with a bag in hand. I didn't learn until a few days later that this was also a big no-no and incredibly disrespectful to her belongings.

On the back of these three offenses and causing such a hub-ub about the cosmetic damage I called her a spoiled child, which she responded with she doesn't want to talk to me again, which I feel are pretty minor and much worse has been done to me in the past which I moved on from. Then while angry, I said something I am not proud of, but nowhere along the line was throwing out obscenities. I just worry that I am being insensitive to other people? I get the feeling that there was some other reason she didn't want to be friends, but used these as an excuse.

Now I don't want to send the DS to repair at nintendo because its >$75 where I could do it for $15 if she'd let me void warranty. So also opinions on selling this current one and buying a new one with the proceeds? A refurb off of the nintendo website is $125

EDIT - Since the conclusion has been reached that I am an asshole, what are people's preferred repair option? Brand new, refurb, or repair current one? I am leaning to a buying a refurb one, but the nintendo website says that it may have minor cosmetic damage which is what caused the problem in the first place. The DS wasn't in mint shape when I got it either though.

104,asshole,AITA for lashing out at a customer service rep and slandering a company online?,"Now, this is a story of how i helped my grandmother with her tv. My grandmother has had Directv since 2005, we have been loyal, she's always made the payments on time, been loyal since the start.

Now, here's what happened. We have At&t for our internet and phone, and Directv for our TV. Now, they had been pushing her and pushing her to bundle everything to save money. She was skeptical at first, but eventually called to set it up.


Now, keep in mind, my mom lives with her. She's the one who helped set up the internet and phone for my grandmother, so the bill was in her name. While DirecTV was in my grandmother's name.

So, to bundle, you actually have to have the newer boxes, we've pretty much had the same boxes since the beginning. We never upgraded to a new box (one that had DVR, OnDemand movies, and everything else).


So, then a technician came out and set all our new equipment up. Now, i hate to be a jerk, but this guy was WAY too old to do his job. He seemed very senile, we asked some basic questions about the features, and the man seemed to have to idea what he was talking about. He also marked one of the remotes,the one for the tv in my bedroom, he labeled it for the ""Bathroom"", which we don't even have a tv in there.


Now, my mom is the one who did most of the talking to him. She knows more about this then my grandmother. Now, she told him countless times that we wanted to switch the Directv account to my mom's name, that way everything else would be bundled. However, this dumbass didn't transfer it over or change the name of the account. He just opened a brand new account in Mom's name. The old man had no idea what he was doing.


So, the end of the month came, and we got our bill. Or rather 2 bills. One in my grandma's name for her old equipment (which he hauled away) and for the new equipment in my mom's name. That's right, we were getting charged TWICE.


Tell me, does this make sense to you? Does it? Do you understand our problem?


Good, that means you have a higher I.Q. then the doofuses who work Directv's customer service. But apparently, Directv can't understand that. We spent hours on the phone trying to explain this to them.


So, we didn't know what to do. We did close the account in my grandma's name, we tried to anyway, but when we did...somehow our tv got shut off. We called back, and they said they also cancelled the one in mom's name because they thought it was ""fraudulent"", because the bank card we used (in my grandma's name) was the same one on file for the old one.


Yeah, they had a hard time understanding that too.


Also, funnily enough, the bill was NEVER bundled. We still got different bills for internet and tv. Not only that, but we were also getting charged MORE. Originally, it was over 150 dollars for both Phone, Tv and internet seperately (combined together), but if it was bundled, it would only cost $130 for all (according to the guy who asked us to bundle). But, our first Directv bill was for 300 DOLLARS!


And a month later, our tv was shut off. Somehow the old account was still open. It was just a big mess. It was because we weren't paying is what customer service said. We had been paying, just somehow on the old account. We tried to explain we didn't have the old equipment anymore, the whole dog and pony show again. They said they were ""Not responsible for damage to their equipment"". And guess what?!, We didn't pay the bill, we didn't have the money. We called and told them this, they said it would be fine and gave us a later date. Not likely, because they went into her bank account and took EVERY DIME she had out of the bank. Without warning. We didn't even have auto-pay enabled.


So, i had to call customer service again. I was fed up with it, and i kind of just wanted to lash out at anyone. I admit it. Now, the customer service lady was Indian. The call center was in India. ANd i had a hard time understanding her. She told us that we hadn't been paying, and to send back our equipment and it would cost somewhere like 600 dollars to get it cut back on. I just started yelling at her. One thing i'm not proud of is i made fun of her ethnicity.


Here's how the end of that conversation went, after she told me that.


""Wait a minute, God Damn it. Are you in India right now?""


She was quiet for a bit. ""Umm, yes sir but i don't see...""


I shouted and interupted her ""Well i want to talk to someone in the God damn united states, instead of you scamming sons of bitches! Cause we have been sending payment after payment to you rag-headed motherfuckers!""


She was completely flustered, i could tell ""Sir, please calm down, there's no need for that.""


""Oh, shut up!. I want to talk to somebody who can speak english, i don't need to talk to you sons of bitches!"" and i hung up.


Keep in mind, i am ashamed of how i acted with that woman. There was no need to call her racial slurs, but i was so fed up with that company.


In response to this, i made a very angry youtube video about it, wrote angry blogs, and kind slandered the company, i called them a scam artist on Twitter as well.",2018-07-12 07:18:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/8y7lhl/aita_for_lashing_out_at_a_customer_service_rep/,8y7lhl,16,3,0.64,0
105,asshole,WIBTA if I told my friend she’s being obnoxious about her new house?,"Ok here’s the context

So a friend of mine is building a house. It’s brand new and she’s all excited about it and talking about it heaps which I’m fine with. She tells me the builder and the house design and it turns out that we were considering building that exact house at one point but after a lot of deliberation we chose to buy a smaller place in a more expensive area instead. 

We laugh about the coincidence then the next time we see each other she tells my husband “oh when it’s built you’ll have to come and see what you could have had.” We all laugh again. 

She has now said that phrase every. Single. Fucking time I have seen her since. “You’ll have to come and see what you could have had.” I mean once was a laugh and I get that she’s excited but I’m getting really fucked off now because it’s like she’s insinuating that somehow we settled for less when we deliberately made this decision. 

I was happy for her in the beginning but now I have the urge to slap her every time she brings it up. I do t generally believe in raining on people’s parade and shutting on their good fortune but I want to tell her that it’s not what we ‘could have had’ because we would have different decor etc. to her anyway.

I have a ring that I have always worn, never taken off, etc., and for a present to Emily I got her a matching ring that is meant to symbolize our friendship. She had helped me out through rough times and we have bonded as really close friends through our mutual hobbies. 

When I told my girlfriend (let's call her Kelly) about the matching ring I got for Emily, she told me that she felt weird about me giving this as a gift to another woman, and that it hurt her. Kelly feels that giving a matching ring as a gift is a very intimate thing, but I just don't see it that way. To me it is a token of friendship, and I don't see it as much different than when Kelly shares clothes with her guy friends. These rings are pure silver and there are matching diamonds on it.

109,asshole,AITA for having a problem with my work schedule?,"Bit of background first, I work at a movie theater that has multiple managers. I regularly work with all of them, but the same manager does the schedule every week. This week, that manager is on vacation, and another manager took over the scheduling for this week.

So, when I first got hired at this theater, I was told it was company policy to have open availability for at least 3 of the 6 weekend shifts. Because of this, I initially set my weekend availability as Friday nights only, Saturday days and nights, and no Sundays. Initially though, I was hired specifically to work ONLY the day shift Monday-Friday. I was and still am basically the only worker who works those hours. I do so every week, and have been for nearly a year.

Due to this set-up, the usual scheduling manager basically made an exception to the policy for me because I already get the max allowed hours by working the day shifts five days a week. In fact, if I was scheduled any more than that, it would be a problem for them because I'm technically part-time, and am not supposed to work more than 40 hours per week. So my usual schedule is 38 hours per week Monday-Friday during the day.

HOWEVER, this week the replacement scheduling manager took away my usual Friday day shift, and replaced it with a Saturday closing shift. It's the first time I've been given that shift since my first two weeks there. I built my weekly routine around my normal schedule, and now this shift is going to screw up a bunch of plans I had made for Saturday night.

So, when I brought this up to the replacement scheduling manager using the same points, she basically told me to suck it up since the policy is that I have to be available for that shift regardless of the fact that I haven't worked that shift in almost a year. She said the only way I could get out of that shift is to trade with a co-worker, which I tried to do with the employee who normally works that shift, who actually got my usual Friday day shift instead. 

Of course, said co-worker won't trade because they also don't want to work that shift because they know it sucks, and that I should be fine with working it since I ""always get the easy shifts."" This coming from a co-worker who only works like 3-4 shifts a week.

So am I the asshole for getting pissed about this issue?

But in the off chance that he could go, I made sure to at least get him a seat. After I told the third friend about the ticket he wrote me a check and I deposited it into my account and email him the ticket.

Fast forward to now, and he tells me he cant go. So I want to sell his ticket and plan on asking more money for it than I paid for it.

113,asshole,AITA for dumping my boyfriend over what he claims is a misunderstanding?,"AITA for dumping my boyfriend over what he claims is a misunderstanding?

I am 31F, he is 27M. Like most people my age, I am 100% for weed legalization, for all the typical reasons. That said, I don’t use it myself. I just don’t like mind-altering substances. I smoked recreationally way back in college, but fewer than five times since then. Weed is just not for me and I don’t want to partner with who is a habitual user either. I’m fine with someone who safely drinks/smokes a few times a month but no more. I’m just not really into using any substances and I want a partner who’s roughly on the same page.

Enter H, my boyfriend of 1 year. When H was a kid, his mom was in and out of his life, generally a shit parent, so H was raised mostly by his dad and grandparents. H and his mother have reconnected in the last few years and she feels guilty that she missed much of his childhood, so she tries to compensate for that by being his buddy, which includes the two of them smoking weed together when he visits. He visits her 1-3 times a month, has dinner at her house, and they share a joint afterward. I’ve never given him a hard time about it.

I met H on Reddit, so we don’t have total control over the geography. I’m in DC and he lives in North Carolina, about 5 hours’ drive away. Earlier this year we began spending a lot more time together, or rather, he began spending a lot of time at my apartment because I have to be here for work and he’s more flexible. I keep normal office hours as an attorney. H is in school full time, but since coming here he’s been able to manage his classes by viewing lectures online, etc. So basically he’s a full time student who studies remotely and only needs to go to campus for tests. He travels home 1-3 times a month, depending what’s going on that month. He’s usually home for about 4 days at a time. We were planning for him to officially move here when he finishes school next year and starts his career.

He knows I don’t want a partner who smokes or drinks habitually, and he’s always maintained that he only smokes when he visits his mom. Back before he started spending a lot of time at my home, we had a discussion where I told him that I don’t want him bringing weed into my home or smoking it here. He agreed not to bring it here, with no fuss. “It’s not even a thing, I swear!” he said. For full disclosure, part of it is that it would look bad and make me lose respect for myself. I’m the only one working, paying for rent and utilities and groceries and restaurants and anything fun that we do. I understand he’s in a pickle—he really can’t get a part-time job in DC or NC because he’s constantly driving back and forth between school and me. He pays for small things when he can, but I’m not asking him to make large or ongoing financial contributions at all, even though he’s here like 80% of the time. I just ask that he keep the place clean, handle his school stuff (he has a 3.96 GPA in STEM), and be cool. I’m fine with our arrangement, but I am NOT paying for somebody to sit at my house and smoke weed while I’m working to support us both. Student who can’t work because of logistics but is productive and helps in other ways—totally fine. Student who can’t work because of logistics and spends free time smoking weed at my house while I work—not fine at all. He knew this and agreed it would be a “bad look.”

Things have been mostly good. We’ve had some growing pains, but overall it is a really wonderful relationship. We have a great connection, are similar in our weirdness, and love each other very much. Recently we’ve started talking timelines for possibly getting engaged, etc., so it’s definitely been moving in a serious direction, this isn’t a casual thing.

On Wednesday after I got home from work we decided to go out for dinner. When we got into his car, it smelled like weed. I said, “It smells like weed in here. Were you smoking weed in here?” I wasn’t even serious. I figured it was just residual from his last visit home that I hadn’t noticed. He started laughing and said something like, “Promise you won’t get too upset.” So obviously it came out that he had smoked weed in his car while I was at work earlier. Then he noticed I was mad and the tone changed. I asked him how often he was doing it, and when it had started, and he kept refusing to answer, just saying things like, “It’s really occasional,” “it’s really not a big deal,” “I really didn’t think you’d care that much,” etc. I have no idea when he started or how often he was doing it, so I’m obviously assuming that this has been an ongoing thing since the beginning.

Then he started trying to weasel his way out of trouble.

I say the biggest deal isn’t the weed itself, it’s the deception. I say he has been lying to me by hiding it. He says he hasn’t been lying because he “just didn’t mention it” and he admitted it when I asked outright. I call bullshit. Who’s the asshole?

I say he broke his promise not to bring weed to my home or smoke it here. He says he didn’t because he didn’t actually smoke in my apartment, he only smoked in his car in the parking garage. I gave him the dirtiest look and he says, “Well, I guess it’s the spirit of the thing, but still... I didn’t smoke in your apartment.” I call bullshit. Who’s the asshole?

I say this is a big fucking deal because he deliberately deceived me for who-knows-how-long. He says this isn’t a big fucking deal because I know he smokes weed with his mom sometimes and I don’t give him a hard time about it, so he had reason to think I wouldn’t really mind. I call bullshit. Who’s the asshole?

I say he broke his promise because we discussed beforehand that I didn’t want weed in my home or near me. He says he misunderstood and didn’t realize it was a big serious thing, he thought I meant I just didn’t like the look of it but it wouldn’t be a big deal if it was just occasional, and not literally inside my apartment, and not in front of me. I call bullshit. Who's the asshole?

I dumped him on the spot despite his protests, packed his things and sent him on his way immediately. Didn’t even go to dinner. He was sad and kept insisting he didn’t know it was a big deal, didn’t know it was such a serious thing to me, he had no idea it was an actual deal-breaker, loves me so much, etc. I basically gave him a hug and told him to fuck off. He wants another chance but I'm skeptical. I thought we were clear before but I don’t want to throw away an otherwise good relationship if there’s a solid chance it really was a misunderstanding that won’t be repeated. Then again, I feel like the trust has just been completely broken, that I’ll always be wondering if he’s smoking while I’m at work and playing me for a fucking idiot. Am I the asshole or is he?

115,everyone sucks,AITA for being angry and cancelling on my grandparents(and kinda not giving a shit about my mom)?,"First some backstory. My parents are in a bitter divorce and I currently live with my mom. I want to move in with my dad(over the summers, in the fall I will be going to college) because my mom is becoming increasingly disconnected from what is actually good for me(I got mediocre grades in HS and she thinks it has to do with me and I say it's at least in part because she is completely unapproachable and she makes me nervous about grades)

My dad has to go to court to gain physical custody, and I am backing him 100%. Now for the potential assholery.

I thought my grandparents(on my mother's side) weren't a part of this. I had a lunch planned with them to go to this restaurant they found. I thought it would be a nice lunch just my grandparents and me. Then my phone rang. It's my grandparents. I thought it was going to be about the lunch(this was a about 7am the day of). This is how the call goes:

Me: hello?

Grandma: do you know what you do to your mother? She cries every night about you

Me: --

Me: *hangs up*

I was completely unprepared for this confrontation. I seriously doubt that my mom cries that often about this. Either way that was a loaded question and i didn't want to continue the phone call.

Fast forward to noon-ish.

My grandparents arrive. They ask if I disconnected. I didn't lie, I told them I hung up. They asked more questions about the situation, a lot of which I didn't answer. Here are some of the ones I did answer:

Grandparents: so we can't be involved in this?

Me: why do you need to be?

Grandparents: she's our daughter

----

Grandparents: why did you hang up?

Me: I hung up because that is a pretty inappropriate thing to talk about before a nice lunch

----

Grandparents: are we still having lunch?

Me: Nope. You ruined this lunch.

----

Grandparents: What about [cousins] that will be there?

Me: you ruined the lunch

(Note: I had no foreknowledge that my cousins would be there)

----

>Now for some questions I didn't answer

Grandparents: Are you not going to see us again?

Me (thinking): I don't know I'm pretty pissed, but I'm not sure who to be pissed at. Mom probably put you up to this but you are going through with it. Silence

----

Grandparents: (I forget the exact wording but basically insinuating that my dad is a failed parent)

I didn't really think so much as feel in reaction to this. There have been a few bumps in the road with the relationship with my dad(but in retrospect I think it's due to the limited contact and that I was projecting my mom onto my dad.) but I get along far better with my dad. I love him and this was just out of line. I storm out of the room and into the backyard. Last time someone said something like this it was someone who wasn't family so I yelled and I probably would have started swearing like a sailor if it wasn't at a very important meeting. I didn't want to do that but I couldn't not react to that in some way.

----

Grandparents: are we going to have to leave angry at each other

Me: (as calmly as I can manage)please leave

----

Grandparents: do you still love us?

Me: please leave(they ask a few other questions that I don't remember but at that point I was just repeating please leave)


After they left, I haven't spoken to them since(this happened towards the beginning of the month). I don't know what I might say because I'm so angry, but I haven't had a good outlet for it and I might just explode. The thing is, they are *grand*parents and they won't be around for much longer.

TL;DR was going to have lunch with grandparents, they talk about a sensitive divorce issue, I hang up on them and don't answer many questions and I haven't talked to them since

118,asshole,Aita (23f) if i feel upset about my bf (28m) asking me to not touch his phone,"Before you judge, here’s a little background. We were having lunch and I was airdropping photos from last night’s event. In iphone, you can see the people mostly tagged. I happened to click it and scrolled through the end and surprise his ex gf’s face is still there. When i clicked it, there are still 10-15 photos from their vacations and etc. 

I lightly called him out and requested to have these deleted, since i see no reason why they should stay in his phone. He defended himself that he really has no time or no interest to check on the old photos. He’s really workaholic and only uses his phone for facebook. But still, why would you keep them when you have a new gf? Nevertheless he promised to sanitize his phone tonight.

Just moments ago, he asked if i can do him a favor. He was really uncomfortable earlier because for him, phones should be private. I agreed but let him know that i was reaaally upset seeing the photos of his ex retained there. I mean what for? To go back on past memories? He explained that i hope he did not offend me, he just really feels uncomfortable when other people check his phone. He told me that he will show me on Monday that the phone is clean. He is now deleting the photos. And that i should trust him that he is not going back to remember memories or feelings, that those don’t mean anything. He also thanked me for reminding him to give time for it.

We already compromised but i still feel a little upset. If he has nothing to hide, why is he asking me that favor? I can throw him my phone to check anytime without feeling uncomfortable.

Any advice on this please?

He explained that it was gutted and cleaned and roasted over a fire with spices etc. I understand cultural differences but I told him that he would be better off not bringing stuff like that at work as it could raise issues for the more sensitive people or at least if wants to bring it cut it up in pieces and leave the head at home. He wasn’t angry but he did bring up he saw people bring in whole roasted chickens without issue and he thought it would be OK (I’ve seen it too but I’ve never seen anyone bring an entire roasted chicken with the head attached).   I didn’t think it was that big of an ask as we do have more sensitive people at work and I was thinking in his best interest.

126,asshole,AITA for not being explicit about my intentions?,"I recently got out of a relationship. In the past, I've gotten close to girls (dinner dates, making out, sleeping over, long phone calls) only for them to later on say, ""Well, I hope you realize I'm only interested in friendship right now.""  

Now, up until now I've always been very honest about what I'm looking for, and haven't taken women out who I'm not serious about.  

Recently, I have had a couple of girls who I've known as friends want to spend more time together now that I'm single. Both of them have long-term issues that guarantee I would never get into a relationship with them. However, they're both attractive,  I have fun when I go out with them, and it feels good to be able to just casually spend time together without thinking about societal constructs of relationships.  

Despite this all being very new, and nothing beyond some light touching occurring, one of my friends has told me that I need to be up front and tell both of these girls that I don't want a relationship with them so that I don't waste their time. I countered that they have a good time with me, they set the pace of things, and while I have no interest in a relationship with them, to state that out loud is presumptuous of their intentions and could be taken as insulting.  

My feeling is that if I'm not allowed to be upset when a girl acts interested to get emotional support and coffee dates, then it's fair game for me to just date casually without explicitly laying everything down.

128,asshole,AITA for publicly humiliating my ex-friend for using her phone during a movie?,"I took my friend to a movie and bought both of us tickets. I was sitting next to her and she had her phone out after they told us to turn our phones off. I said, nicely, ""can you put your phone away, they told us to"" and she said it's just the previews, so I said ""OK"". Then after the movie started she had her phone out and was definitely scrolling through facebook. I snapped at her, ""turn off your phone, that's very rude!"" And she said, defensively, ""I was just looking at the time!"" Then she took out her phone again to look at texts and I angrily gathered up all my stuff and moved to another seat in the movie theatre. But I could still see her regularly using her phone throughout the whole movie.

So after the movie was over, I stormed into the lobby and said, ""Attention everyone, I have an announcement to make: this bitch had her phone out the entire fucking movie!"" 

Later on, I was in the bathroom and she came up to my stall and said ""I don't think we should be friends anymore"" and I said ""okay"".

Later on, she called me to let me know that she has a lot of respect for me but that I had crossed a boundary and was being emotionally abusive.

In the interests of context, we'd just had a fight earlier that day. I'd kind of unloaded on her things I had been keeping to myself,  namely, that she has owed me $200 for almost 2 years now. At the time, I told her not to stress about it and pay me back when she could, because she was having money issues at that time. And over the next year or so she was always stressing about money and complaining to me about her money issues so I never wanted to bring it up. But now she's going to go on a trip to Europe with her bf and recently bought herself a TV and told me how relieved she was to finally be financially stable. And so I was bitter about it and she said that she didn't realize I was still holding that against her after two years.  She said I needed to communicate my feelings to her instead of holding it in. So the reason I was so pissed off during the movie is because I felt I had made my feelings on phone use during a movie very plain and she kept doing it, meaning she had been lying about how she would have respected my feelings about the money thing if I'd only made them apparent.

130,everyone sucks,AITA for ignoring my girlfriend,"My (41m) girlfriend (47f) of about a year has had issues with her son (15), who is now living with his father. My girlfriend is struggling with him leaving, though this is best all round as the situation at their home had become quite toxic. This all happened about 3 weeks ago.

Roll on last Sunday and my girlfriend and I go for a nice walk in the Lake District. Well, that was what it was meant to be. Half an hour before we arrived at the walking spot, she starts having a go at me, criticising everything that I do, have done or might have done. This criticism then carries on for another hour and a half whilst on our walk, when I finally flip, stop talking and decide it's best that I just walk back to the car. This happens, silent trip home (just over an hour), then go our seperate ways for the night.

Some of the topics that I was criticised for:

Not being emotional enough (I told her from day 1 I am emotionally stunted and lack empathy in a LOT of situations)

Not knowing what she wants (I always tell her my likes / dislikes)

Not knowing what women need emotionally - got told to work it out or 'go read a book'

I don't contribute to our relationship - she then reeled off all the things that she has done (cooking meals etc) but failed to recognise that whenever we go out I pay for everything, and that day I had prepared all food, drink, drove there and she said she had more input as she suggested where we should go.

My house smells of dog (I have two very cute dogs), I admitted that the house smells of dog, and no matter the cleaning it will always be that way.

My house is incredibly messy - which it can be because when my 4 year old son stops over, then absolute mayhem ensues. I have him every other day, though being brought up in a strict household, I've gone the other way and basically anything goes. I always tidy up the day after he leaves, though she never sees the tidy house.

Basically, the woman criticised my whole life for 2 hours, something I would struggle to do when listing Hitler's bad points.

The thing that made me flip was when she said the following:

""I think it's weird that even though you are emotionally stunted, you are still very affectionate with children"". I asked her what she meant by that, she said ""your son and your nieces and nephews"", though I am unsure why she said children and not relatives. Then she said ""It's also weird you like dogs more than me"". I'm not sure if she was implying I was an incestuous paedophile that had bestiality tendencies or what as I was livid.

The next day at work, because we work together, I completely ignore her as I was still upset at what she said. I get a text at lunch saying I was ""pathetic and childish"" for ignoring her.

While the justice system has a history of fucking things up, I think this case is too big in the spotlight for that to happen.

134,asshole,AITA for assertively insisting that some girl park like a conscientious and normal adult?,"I return from a night on the town with some friends and my fiance to the house she shares with four other ladies.

Most of these friends are the rock-climbing variety that find laid-back irresponsibility the crux of cool. You know the type I mean. We pull up to the house and some Subaru from Oregon is parked parallel in three parking spaces. No, there are not other spaces; this house is on the side if a mountain.

I've been drinking. I get out, walk in to the little Kumbaya circle they've got going in the living room, glare around the group...

""Who's parked like that?""

Some girl I've never seen in my life but looks like she crawled out of an REI ad hops up and says it was her, that she's sorry, and that she'll move it in a little bit. I say.

""No, you'll move it now.""

She gets pissed, asks who I am, but moves her car. I say thanks, and go on my way. Keep in mind this is not my house.

The next morning the housemate that hosts these Chachis insists that I apologize to the girl. I firmly decline to do any such thing on the grounds that all of her friends haven't displayed any sort of manners regarding shared living space. Apparently she and another housemate believe I went out of bounds in my behavior.

136,asshole,AITA for thinking people should choose their conversations wisely.,"I'm dating a guy for 4 years, my boyfriend doesn't hang out with his ex, but his friends do on the weird occasion. 

Ive had issues with the girl at the start of the realtionship try to manipulate ours, so as expected I'm not to fond of the girl. 

I don't have a problem however about who hangs out with her, I can't decide that for others. 

Should it be acceptable for my boyfriends friends to tell stories about his ex while I'm sitting at the same table while 10 people listen. I see these people for gatherings once every 1-2 months, while they see each other 1 week. Is it hard to not talk about those stories and wait till I'm around? 

AITA for being a salty asshole?

137,asshole,AITA for telling off a homeless guy?,"For the record, this happened about 10 years ago when I was but a lad. 

I went to college in Central Illinois which is pretty much Cardinals country (baseball team).  However, since the school is a major university there were A LOT of Chicago and Chicago suburbs students.  I'd say the campus was 40% Cards fans, 40% Cubs fans, and 20% Sox fans.  

If you don't know Cubs and Cards are major rivals.  Anyway one day I'm walking down the street wearing a Cubs shirt and hat (this was a time when the Cubs sucked and the Cards had just won the World Series).  As I'm waking, a homeless dude comments 'It must suck to be a Cubs fan. Hehehe'. I was kinda pissed so I replied 'It must suck to be a fucking bum' and walked off.  That was the end of the exchange.  

So was I an asshole? I don't think I was but I also don't think I was kind about it either.  ",2018-10-07 19:18:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/9m7v21/aita_for_telling_off_a_homeless_guy/,9m7v21,135,122,0.8,0
138,asshole,AITA for letting my BF live with me? One housemate thinks so.,"My BF and I have been dating for 1 year. I am in my 4th year of college and have been living for the past 3 years in a lovely house near campus with 4 other girls, all close friends of mine. This summer, our landlord said he wanted to renovate the basement and add a bedroom there, and asked if we wanted to find someone so he could rent it to them and lower our individual rents as well. We said sure, why not.

We found this girl on our school housing page, lets call her Karen. She expressed interest in the room, took a look around, and signed onto the lease for the basement room. We all met her and thought she was fine. She moved in this September and for a few weeks, there were no problems. 

Meanwhile, my boyfriend has been living with me during the summer without my landlord knowing. Technically we're not supposed to do this, but he pays his share of the utilities bill and we split my rent. My bedroom is on the top floor, is very large and spacious and it's quite comfortable. There's only one other girl on the top floor, my close friend and cousin, and we share the bathroom. We have been having no problems whatsoever. My boyfriend and all my other housemates get along great too. 

Except, it seems like Karen has a problem with him. We kind of told her about my boyfriend living with me at the start of the year and she seemed fine with it. She met him and they were civil. We told her that we split the utilities bill 7 ways so he pays his share, which is only fair. Plus she lives in the BASEMENT so it's not like they cross paths often. But two days ago, he went to the basement to use the laundry machine, and that was when she came out of the bathroom, naked. She had just taken a shower and was going back to her room. My BF immediately covered his eyes and apologized, she screamed, ran to her room and slammed the door. 

The next day my BF tells me what happened. We find Karen in the kitchen and he apologizes again. She seems a bit huffy but accepts the apology. Then she asked him, ""So why exactly are you living here?"" My BF explained to her about wanting to be close to me, etc. She didn't press further. 

Then today I got a message from Karen with a picture of our lease agreement. She highlighted the section about visitors only being able to stay over for a certain length of time. I told her that again I am sorry about the laundry incident but everyone else in the house does not have a problem with my BF living her. She says, ""Well I just think it's unethical, frankly, to be going against the lease so blatantly. I don't think \[Landlord name\] would be happy. Plus when I signed on I didn't expect that there would be a man living in the house. I thought there would only be girls."" She then told me about how her mother visited the other day and was shocked to find my BF in the kitchen blahblahblah. 

Then she basically says she's ""inclined"" to let the landlord know about my BF living with me. We had a house meeting the other day, with everyone BUT Karen, and they all agreed that she was out of line. One of my other housemates even talked to her about it. 

Is there anything else I can do? I'm afraid the landlord will find out and make my BF move. And even if he doesn't, there's definitely going to be tension between Karen and the rest of us. 

TL;DR: New housemate is suddenly not okay with my boyfriend living in my room after an incident, and wants to tell the landlord about him. ",2018-10-10 00:26:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/9munz5/aita_for_letting_my_bf_live_with_me_one_housemate/,9munz5,19,10,0.76,0
139,asshole,"WIBTA, if I wrote a note to my neighbors about excessive sex.","Since I have lived here I can hear our neighbors have 'hearable' sex every Friday at around 11:00. I've never cared everypne has sex. Also Maybe me and my wife annoy them too.

So the issue is, I had a party last Friday that was loud and I forgot to write a note for the people in the apartment, I hear her banging on the walls at 11:30 and turned down the music. We left the house to go clubbing st 12:00 not to annoy anyone further. 
(Pretty weak, as it's one party in the year that ended at 12:00) 

We have every right to have a party on Friday nights. I was just in the wrong for not letting them know about the party. I bit my tounge and without being condescending, I wrote her an apology note. 

So coming back to tonight, this Friday 11:00 she's having excessively loud sex. I want to write her a note about her stupid bed as it has gotten louder. 

Some very strong double standards here that I want to point out but I don't want to come across rude. 

WIBTA, if I gave her this note. 

>Please, you need to fix your bed.

>We are courteous when we have sex. I understand it's an appartement and we have sex also, but your headboard is squeaky snd can hear it every week banging on out wall. It's gotten to the point where you need to repair it. 

>Please fix the problem before next week.",2018-10-12 21:46:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/9noh25/wibta_if_i_wrote_a_note_to_my_neighbors_about/,9noh25,10,3,0.64,0
140,asshole,AITA for abandoning a toxic friend?,"Back in middle school I had this “friend” who constantly put me down, made me feel bad and even had this game where she and this other girl pretended I don’t exist and just basically used me to feel better about herself. although we did have some good times and liked some of the same stuff. Anyway after I left that school I cut contact with her and told her how throughout our friendship she’d been verbally abusive towards me and that I didn’t want to be friends with her anymore. She seemed completely oblivious about the whole thing though like she didn’t realise she’d been a bitch to me and that was that.

 We don’t talk anymore but last night I had a dream about her and I now I feel guilty because maybe if I had spoken up before while we were still friends she would’ve stopped (not that she seemed sorry when I was cutting ties with her) but I didn’t do that cos I was a pushover who never stood up for myself and instead I just harbored all this anger and grudge towards her and abandoned her as soon as I could. 

 I feel bad now because I was her only friend there eventhough she treated me like shit and really was only friends with me because nobody else liked her but still I left her behind in that toxic class room with those horrible people who never liked me or her and I feel like if I had maintained the friendship she would at least have someone to turn to. In the last few months we were friends she told me she had bulimia in an email and i did nothing about it (she asked me not to ask her about it).
