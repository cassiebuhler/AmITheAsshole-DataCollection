We operate small patrol boats, and we work with SEALs, usually the people getting the SEALs in and out of places. Our training is quite similar to theirs, and when I heard that my cousin was getting married to a SEAL and when I heard about him, I knew he was a phony. The stories that were relayed back to me, and the shit I've seen from his post was just bullshit. I also heard that my nephew did more pull ups than him, 5, so I know that's horseshit. There's no Navy SEAL who can only do 5 pull ups. Bare minimum is like 10 or 15 to even get into basic training. 

I never got to meet this guy, and I think he was actually avoiding me because whenever I showed up he always left. I told everyone in the family my concerns, most just ignored me saying i misinterpreted what happened, I'm not a SEAL so i wouldn't know, these ignoramuses were just so stubborn.  Well I knew the only way to expose this fucker is to get outside help so I contacted Don Shipley, who is a former navy SEAL and he has a bunch of social media accounts and websites where he posts content of him exposing hundreds if not thousands of fake navy SEALs either by approaching them or calling them and blasting them online. Anyone who suspects someone of being a fake SEAL can submit their info to Don Shipley, he will contact you back with proof of him being or not being a SEAL as he as a record to a database of every navy SEAL. 

Shipley not only sends proof of him not being a SEAL, he also calls my cousin and he asks my cousin about his service. He calls him out on everything about how none of his service making sense, the main one being he said he was in seal class 111 which would've been like 40 years ago or something. I then sent this to everyone who was attending the wedding in a mass email chain. I was in one that had like 400 email addresses for the upcoming wedding attendees, as well as everyone on his facebook and ig friend's list. 

I have gotten so much hate from him and his family for this and my cousin is devastated knowing this man is a fraud and a liar, so is everyone else who grew to like him.

We lived in a safe neighborhood, there was always food in the fridge, and I tried to take them out to games/movies or treat them whenever I could. However, I did have to work multiple shifts and I could not afford a babysitter, as a result my older daughter had to take care of her younger siblings after school most weekdays. She’s become very resentful towards me because of that and said I robbed her of her childhood, but I was not sure what else to do. I was working almost 12-14-hour days just to provide a safe environment for the kids and had absolutely no savings afterwards. It was a horrible situation, but I just had no money at all to put towards a babysitter.

My daughter left home when she was 18 and cut contact with all of us for the last two years. Some of my friends/neighbors offered to watch the younger kids while I worked some days, and I was in a better financial place at this point, so we were able to scrape by without her help. However, she reached out to me a couple months ago and said she was struggling during the pandemic and asked if she could move back in with me and I said absolutely. However, ever since she’s been back living with us in our new house, there have been a lot of fights over finances. My husband is a dentist with his own practice and makes very good money. My daughter’s been saying that he should help pay for her college amongst other things, like helping her get a new car, etc. This has caused a lot of problems between my husband and I and I told her that he doesn’t know her at all (she also refused to come to the wedding), and it’s not fair for me to make him give her money. She’s been causing a lot of fights at our house because of this and we’re at the end of our patience and close to telling her she needs to move out, AITA?",2020-11-15 15:17:24,2440,6332,0.96,85,6,10,20,,1,,,2,,,1,,1,1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don’t know if she’s chemically imbalanced or what the deal is, that part isn’t really my business, I just know that how it manifests is the child is highly disruptive to the learning environment. 

This girl will throw fits in the middle of class, total melt downs with cursing and shouting, that grinds instruction to a halt. And worse, she’ll be very mean (beyond cliquey. Like, needling into kids deepest insecurities and making them not want to come to school.) 

I brought my concerns to the teacher after my daughter outlined her initial few encounters with her and the teacher suggested some conflict management strategies for my daughter to try, which led me to believe it was an issue between the two of them personally (my child and this other one.) 

But then I found out from other parents that their kids reported identical issues with the girl. We all got together and spoke to the teacher and she said that while she really wanted to help us that she was bound by certain privacy laws about exactly what she could and could not say. 

So we went to the mother of the girl (specifically I and one of the dad’s did, so she wouldn’t feel bombarded but wouldn’t be able to brush it off as one rude parent’s misplaced blame.) 

She vaguely said that yes her daughter is “dealing with some things.” But that experts have recommended it would be best for her to work through them in a regular classroom environment and to learn norms being surrounded by her same aged peers. 

We tried to delicately communicate that her learning whatever she is was coming at the expense of all the other kids learning their academics and feeling socially safe, but she more or less said, in a kind but firm way, “Welcome to public school. Your kids are going to have to get along with all kinds of people.”

We first approached higher ups trying to instigate them to offer them an IEP. We were eventually able to find out they had been extended services and turned them down (and I don’t think we were even supposed to know that much.) 

We are now petitioning to have the child removed from the classroom. There is a camp that feels as though this is against the foundational principles of the education system. That everyone should be able to partake who wants to and if we don’t like it we should take our kids out instead of forcing them somewhere they don’t want to be or don’t feel is best for their child. 

Before this instance I would have completely agreed. So, now I’m wondering, am I the asshole for doing this?

I was angry hearing this because that is a discussion that her actual parents (Her father and I) should have together. I’m not sure why her stepmom would try and make that decision when she has no right to have any input.

Yesterday I took her to a piercing shop and let her get the piercing without informing her father so now he and his wife are unhappy with me and are calling me “childish.” But I simply don’t want some random woman to try and act like my daughter’s mother.

He was only 16, and this was devastating to his father and me. 

We agreed to donate his organs, and a match was found for his heart. The whole process was anonymous. The recipient did not know who we were, and we did not know the identity of the recipient. 

A few months after our son's passing, we received a letter from the recipient's father, relayed through the hospital. He thanked us, telling us what they had gone through and what having the heart meant to him. 

After a few weeks, we wrote back, communicating through the hospital. Several exchanges later, we all decided to reveal our identities and met in person. The boy who received the heart was 12. I cried when I met him. He seemed extremely shy. 

I asked if I could listen to my son's heartbeat, but his parents seemed very uncomfortable with it. I was in tears as I pointed out that my son had allowed their son to live, and all I wanted to do was hear my son's heart beat one more time. 

The father became very firm and said no. The visit was cut short and the family left. This was about a year ago.

Recently, the family reached out asking if we would be willing to get tested for possible liver donation, as neither parent was a match. I thought this was a huge ask, considering they wouldn't even let me listen to my son's heart beat. We said no, but then over the weeks they asked a few more times, saying they were desperate and that we could be their only hope. They even brought my son into it, saying not to let his gift be in vain. Honestly, that infuriated us and we continue to refuse. I realize they're desperate but this was just so difficult for us the first time, and now they're asking us for even more.

I don't like her friend because I think she's a very selfish,  self-centered, loud, and irritating person to be around, and her friend knows that I hold that opinion about her. There's a lot more to it than that, but this post would be much too long if I was to go over the more in depth reasons we don't get along. Anyways, because of my feelings towards her friend, they've been having issues within their own friendship. 

We all decided to go out to eat in order to make things better between us, and while self admittedly her friend did kind of annoy me throughout, I thought the dinner had gone well. That all changed when the bill finally came. We had already decided to go half on the tip, and while I put $15 down, she thought it'd be funny to pull out her purse and make a heart out of pennies for a tip. 

I saw that and asked if she was serious, to which she said ""well I just don't really believe in tiping"". That upset me so I pulled out my wallet, put an extra $10 down and started getting up to leave. Her friend said ""what did I do?"" and I told her ""I just don't feel like conversing with a piece of shit anymore"" and I went to my car. 

When my wife came to the car she began to yell at me. I told her I understood why she was angry, but that some people just don't get along and that I felt it was best that her friend and I stop trying to get along. I don't control my wife and she's allowed to hangout with anyone she pleases, so while I do see why her friend and I getting along would be ideal, I don't see why it's mandatory that we get along for their own friendship to work.

Growing up, she has always had a large big room with a king-size bed, plenty of wardrobe space, ensuite, etc. My room is tiny and can barely fit all my belongings in it. It's not ideal but that's just the way the house was built and there wasn't anything I could ever do about it.

Since January, my sister has started to spend an increased amount of time at her boyfriend's house. It started off once a week, then every weekend, and now it's to the point she won't come back for over a week at a time. When she does, it'll be for just a night and then she'll go back to her boyfriend's for another week.

I don't think it's fair her big room sits empty for weeks at a time while I live at home permanently and have a crowded, cramped, room. I've spoken to my parents who both agree with me in private that since she's never home, we should be able to swap rooms.

The problem is that my sister, although 24 years in age, has all the mental maturity of a hormonal 14 year old. When we told her about it she started throwing a temper tantrum and crying, before threatening to move out (she basically already is but whatever) and never see any of us again. My parents have never been able to deal with her and they immediately backed down and beg for her forgiveness. 

I don't think it's fair and I told her next time she's gone I'm going to move everything anyway.

They are wonderful girls and my entire world. However they live with my ex full time while I get every other weekend and some holidays. 

Now my ex was just offered a job and it's a really good job and I'm happy for him however, it's in another state. And I'm pretty sure he's going to take it because it's in his home state where all his family is. 

It's also my home state, as that's where we met and my family all lives there too. So knowing that this is something my ex is going to do I decided to discuss it with my husband, and some options. 

I told him that if my ex does back there I would like to too, to be with my children and my family. Of course I can't expect him to immediately lift his life and move with me, but I was trying to figure out of there was way we can do this. At first he was treating it lightly and was like, ""yeah I'm sure you'll be able to visit them or see them at Christmas"" but when he really I was being serious he grew upset. 

He told me that he didn't want to move anywhere and that I shouldn't either, that our lives were here. And I agree, however my children are also my life and I know for a fact that I wouldn't be able to see them consistently anymore, because they would live so far away so it would be more rare that I see them. 

Anyways he called my selfish for not thinking with him and I told him if I was selfish I wouldn't have brought it up and made up my mind and then I told him that my children came first in my life. And now he's refusing to talk to me and claimed I was being self-centered and inconsiderate. 

So now I'm asking reddit, Am I an Asshole for telling my husband my children come first? And considering following them back to my home state?

Edit: some people have been asking for this information do here it is: I would like to explain that there is a reason I have visitation rights and that's because I have had a history of being an absent parent and not prioritizing my children in my life, I know that court will side with my ex. I am close to my children and I love them wholeheartedly, and I do think that this move (if it does end up happening but most likely it will) would be beneficial for them as it's closer to both our extended families.

Edit #2: I've gotten a lot of advice, and a lot of judgement. I do want to say that I am going to do some couple's therapy for me and my husband, I think that's the best way to do things

Edit #3: I'm adding this because I have been getting a lot of these comments and they're really affecting me, I forgot how hurtful the internet can be. First of all, I was an absentee parent. I was absent for the younger years, they are current 10-8 years old. I have spent years building back the trust and love of being a mother. I am on schedule to have 50/50 custody. Because of all this, my children are my priority and I would do anything for them.

Edit #4: last edit because I forgot to mention this. I am not trying to give my husband an ultimatum. This is not a yes or no situation..I love my husband and am going to discuss every option with him. And I am also going to go over my custody order to see if anything can be changed. Thank you everyone for your comments, it really made me think a lot and I appreciate it.

Edit #5: I can't respond to comments anymore so I will answer your questions here: my ex is ok with me having 50/50, we have talked about it, and we have discussed it. When it comes down to it, he wont fight. We have both decided this is what is best for the girls. Now because he is considering moving, this might change the way things are and I believe the best way for me to go is to follow my children. However there is obviously a lot to think about so we'll see how everything turns out. If it's wanted, I could post an update later.",2020-11-27 03:12:01,518,913,0.94,26,15,49,4,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We were not living together but saw each other on the weekends, mostly in his one-room-apartment.

He had this horrible habit of not reacting to any of his alarms, he always set up 4-5 (phone/tablet/radio...) but would just let them ring until they got off by themselves or put them off and get back to sleep again. He also was a night owl, meaning that he could work and concentrate best at night while I am more like a daywalker and like to do my things while the sun is out. I sometimes tried to wake him up from my home - called his landline phone (dunno if this is the righ term) and let it ring until he got up and answered me. This was mostly a sign that he was awake and would not continue to sleep again. Even though we sometimes had the case that he answered the phone and talked to me, then went back to sleep and couldn't remember that we even talked (note: he answered in his usual, but sleepy voice even to questions.) So you might get it: It was a pain in the ass waking him up. And when I could sleep in, I always sat straight in the bed when his alarms went off, since I'm a light sleeper. So I put them off, tried to wake him of by shaking him (gently) and talking to him. In 90% of the cases he was grumpy and he complained I wasn't gentle enough or annoying. But since he was usually late to his appointments I had to use harsh methods sometimes.

One day, when I was at my own appartment, I had a job interview the next day in a city where I had to go by train.  He had an exam the same day in the morning. So he asked me if I could wake him via landline phone as I did some times before. I agreed.In the next morning I was stressed, had my mind full of things to remember during the interview and was almost late for my train. So I forgot to call him.

When the interview was over, I remembered that he had his exam and called him after. He went full rage mode, said he overslept and missed the exam. And that it was only my fault that he missed it, that he couldn't trust me anymore with such important tasks and that he would have rather asked his mom to call him instead. Note: The possibility that he wakes up by landline phone is still only around 50/50.

I actually think it should only be his very own responsibility to wake up in time for an important exam and that my phone call would've just been an additional liveline.

But I wonder if I maybe am the asshole for forgetting to call?

TLDR; I sometimes woke up my then bf by calling him on his phone, had a job interview and forgot it. he overslept and blamed me for it.",2020-11-26 12:59:56,328,1331,0.96,12,3,93,44,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We started going in January but then stopped until August because of Covid so no real breakthrough happened until recently. We're going because after my mom married her husband I was not too happy and when she had my half siblings I was uninterested and she feels like I'm still not all in, so she wanted us to talk it all out and work through this together. I was so dumb to think it would go any kind of good and that she would finally listen because she has used it to say the same things over and over again, that she doesn't understand me, doesn't know why I had to be so negative about expending our family and how she did it more for me than anyone. She also keeps asking to have her husband in therapy with us and doesn't understand why the therapist agrees it should be just me and her for now.

So our last session was Wednesday afternoon and she was saying yet again how it bothered her that when she gave birth to the twins I was so disinterested and negative and how I hurt everyone with my actions and how she did everything in her power to make it better I got so mad. The therapist noticed and asked me if I was bothered by what she was saying. I started saying how I felt when my mom said I was never open with how I felt.

I got even more mad and started yelling that she never ever listens to me and that I never wanted her to get married and I hadn't wanted siblings. That if she wanted a new husband and more kids that was fine but she had asked me before if I was okay with her getting married and I said no, but she did it anyway and acted like I had said I was okay with it and then she expected me to be super excited she was having babies with someone who wasn't my dad and she wanted this happy kid who was so glad her family was moving on from her dad and growing without him. I told her if she wanted to know whether I really wanted it back then (4 years ago) then no. I didn't want her to get married. I didn't want younger siblings. I liked being an only child if I couldn't have a sibling from her and my dad and nothing she said or did would change how I felt at the time and acting like we really discussed how I felt when all these changes were happening was wrong because she heard what she wanted to hear and dropped the conversation entirely. I told her if she wanted to know how I felt when she told me she was pregnant then she should think back to what I said.

She's mad because of what I said and for yelling at her.

When my daughter was about 2 years old, Shelly moved out with my daughter and I haven’t seen either of them since. 

I can freely admit that at that point in my life, I was irresponsible and stupid. There was a court hearing regarding custody/child support, but I was out of town for work and didn’t go. I didn’t realize at the time it could proceed without me and I would have been fired if I flew home for it. In retrospect, I should have gone. 

Even though the court ordered joint custody, I’ve never been allowed to see my daughter. Shelly moved to another state and I didn’t know where they were for a long time. She’s ignored calls/messages from me and anyone in my family and no one in her family will speak to us either. 

I’m now married and my wife and I have a toddler together. A couple of weeks ago, my wife found Shelly on fb and reached out, asking if she would consider letting our toddler have a relationship with her older sister. Shelly wrote her back saying no. But she also asked my wife to please get me to sign paperwork to change my older daughter’s last name. Currently, she has my last name and Shelly wants it changed to hers. 

I’ve refused. I get that I didn’t make good decisions. I didn’t know what I was doing back then and couldn’t afford a lawyer. Once I was financially able to fight for my daughter, she was older and I was a stranger. I didn’t want to scare her and force her to be with me. BUT, I also don’t want to do anything that would make her or anyone else think I don’t want anything to do with her. I DO want to be in her life. If she turns 18 and wants to change her name, that’s ok. But I won’t sign anything to change it now. 

Shelly told my wife that my reaction is completely selfish and this is exactly why I’m not allowed to see her. Because I don’t think of what’s best for her. 

I don’t want to hurt my little girl. I’m sad af about this whole situation. Am I an asshole for holding onto this?  Or is it really better for her if I just let her change the name?

I was called in with an hour notice and immediately called my sister, who lives about 10 minutes away, to see if she could watch my daughter. She said she could but her “rate” was $30 an hour. I was absolutely shocked that she asked for money.

I know she herself isn’t planning on having kids but she has always seemed happy to be an Aunt. I knew it would be at least a 10 hour day and I cant afford to just drop $300 unexpectedly right now. I begged her to take her without the fee but she refused, claiming that her time was worth money.

I ended up hanging up on her and calling a friend who lives quite a bit farther out. My friend happily took my daughter for the day, no expectation of pay. I was late to work though (and got a write up) because I had to drive so much farther.

My sister ended up calling me yesterday to chat, totally unbothered by what had happened. I told her that I was upset at her and didn’t want to talk and she unloaded on me. She told me that I was the one in the wrong for just expecting her to be free childcare. I told her that it was horrible of her to want money to spend a day with her niece and that I was going through a difficult time, emotionally and financially, and she was being unsupportive and selfish.

We ended the call on a sour note and haven’t spoken again since. Until yesterday I didn’t think for second that I was wrong to be upset. I don’t think its unreasonable to expect your own sister to help out once in a blue moon without needing to pay her. I also think its hypocritical of her considering she has 3 dogs that I used to watch for her when she vacationed without any pay. That was years ago before I moved but I feel like she should remember that.

Am I really the asshole here like my sister says?

TLDR: Wanted my sister to watch my daughter in an emergency and she wanted to be paid. I am upset she wanted pay and she is upset I expected her to watch her niece without pay.

EDIT: I took a break from this thread due to the hundreds of cruel and abusive comments and DMs I received. To answer your questions:

1. My sister has never babysat my daughter before. She was born when my ex and I were living across the country. I moved back home 1 month ago and my parents are my backup childcare.
2. Yes my job is shitty and my boss is shitty. My industry was hit hard and unemployment is high. I apply for every other job I can find but no luck.
3. When my boss called they said ""You need to be here in an hour tops or there will be consequences"". I was extremely stressed when I called my sister.
4. I brought up the dog sitting because I wanted to illustrate that we used to have the kind of relationship where favors were done without a fee. I was absolutely blindsided when she asked for money.

Update for those who care: My sister ended up telling my parents about what happened and she got chewed out. They called me and told me they were ashamed of her behavior. Take what you will from that.",2020-10-29 13:49:48,1017,1124,0.92,43,3,97,16,,,,,,,,1,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In that time, their daughter (14) has acted out. My daughter found her lying on the couch black out drunk for the first time when she was 11. 

My ex son in law recently had a week with her in which she refused food for 4 days in a row.

I haven’t had a much better time with my granddaughter either. Once I drove her to a birthday party and she ended up pulling a 24 hour disappearing act until finally a friend admitted she was with him.  

And the worst part is that many of the daughter’s problems weren’t reported by either side because both my daughter and ex son in law feared that the other parent would lose all custody and they’d have to deal with her full time. 

Now my daughter and son in law are at their breaking point. They both are arguing that they don’t want custody and that the daughter is the other’s responsibility. They have both gone as far to threaten to get themselves arrested so that they’d lose custody. My daughter even said that she was contemplating purposefully driving drunk and getting pulled over with her daughter in the front seat so she’d lose custody. 

They finally turned to me and begged that I take her in. My ex son in law stood outside my house yesterday in the pouring rain for a full hour begging me to take my granddaughter in until he finally went home. 

I finally emailed the both of them and said that I was one year away from turning 60 and had already planned my life in a way that doesn’t involve a child. 

I ended it by saying that if they both wanted their child to be living anywhere besides their homes, then it would be in a foster care facility. 

AITA? My daughter and her ex were teen parents but honestly this is such a mess and their daughter is such a mess that I don’t feel it’s fair to make me deal with the destruction they caused.",2020-10-11 23:36:17,1173,6302,0.96,9,1,33,110,,,1,,1,,,2,,,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So. Due to the current circumstances in the world, my previous company down sized and I was made redundant. We were given 2 months notice because the company was amazing like that (They didn't want to let us go but had to) so I had time to have another job lined up and thus our income didn't actually take a hit so as far as I was concerned that money is fun money.

The pay was £8000 and I had planned on using a part of it to build a home made electric car with our son, from the base up, so going as far as welding the chassis. So I estimated we would need about £4.5-5k. So I put 6k on the side for the car in total. Which I was then going to use the other 2k to put towards a family holiday once everything settles down.

I told these plans to my wife and she got up set. Claiming she had planned (and already promised) the money to be used for an expensive spa week over in the EU for her and her sister for after Christmas because her sister was depressed about having to cancel a wedding.

I told her that wasn't going to happen as it was my money, especially since she just promised it without consulting me first.

Well, an argument ensued and she called me an a-hole and told me that a ""kit car was a waste of money since it couldn't be used on the road"" which is neither true, nor false, and that ""If I was adamant that she wasn't allowed to take her sister on the trip then I had to tell her sister""

She completely ignored that it was going to be a project between me and our son who has just turned 12 this year and has developed a massive interest in cars.

PS. before people start commenting. My wife isn't generally an EP. She is normally a lovely women. Though she has a fiery temper at times. I am 100% sure this is a one off due to her being disappointed.

&#x200B;

Edit:   
I kinda agree with the posts that ESH but not because ""It's not 'My' money but 'our' money"" but because it is a lump sum and they rarely come into the house. 

When it comes to spending money, we typically have an arrangement of ""I pay the bills, needs and general groceries and then anything left is mine"" while she doesn't have a stable income her self, she does earn off hobbies. That money is hers, the excess in my wages are mine. If there is something she wants/needs that is extra to things that come out of the household budget, i.e. toiletries, and she can't afford it her self, or has little to no fun money that month, I will split my money with her so we both always have money to do what we want. 

We sat down and talked about it after dinner today and chose to split it 50:30:20 

50% for me as it covers the cost of building the car and I am doing with our son. 30 for her because it 3k is MORE than plenty for a spa day in the UK for 2 people. It will leave them money for a meal even if they can't go for a weeks vacation, and then the final 2k will be put in next years holiday fund. 

Also. Apparently she does read AITA because she came into my office tapping her feet. I had PTSD to my mother finding me playing with matches. Though it was what turned into us having a proper, civil discussion over the problem. ",2020-11-23 15:17:32,155,817,0.96,1,3,28,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am cool with Joe, but he is less a friend and more of an acquaintance. I know he is having a lot of family drama and has been couch surfing since his parents kicked him out. He has no job and doesn't go to school. I understand how not having a stable roof over your head can make that challenging.

I do work and go to school. I don't have much money at the end of the month because I help my family out with rent. I like to go to IHOP on the weekend to reward myself. If I go with friends, one person usually pays the tab, but all pay for our portion plus contribute to a tip at the same time. Point is that money is tight with me.

This morning I went to IHOP with Nick and Joe (he sort of invited himself as he is staying with Nick and his family right now). My meal was like $11, Nick's was $9 and Joe's was $15. I offered to put it on my credit card and Nick gave me a $10 for his tab. Joe just shrugged and said he had no money but would pay me back ""later."" That pissed me off. I asked him ""oh so you found a job? When do you get paid?"" He laughed and said he had no job. I asked him how is he going to pay me back and he said not to worry. He was shameless and nonchalant about it.

Finally I told him that it was a total dick move to invite yourself to breakfast knowing he could not pay and would not pay me back. I told him I don't even know him and to do that to someone you don't know means you're very likely not to pay them back. He laughed so I said no wonder his family disowned him.

Nick told me that was a low-blow. I asked Nick then to pay me back and he said he didn't have anymore money and that's not his problem.",2020-11-07 09:48:29,305,2173,0.97,5,0,78,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've started seeing a girl who is a hair dresser, she's really kind but sometimes this is her downfall. I invited her round to meet my mom and I was horrified to see that when we walked into the lounge my mom had all her hair stuff ready and brought a mirror in. I asked what she was doing and she said ""what better way to get to know eachother than her do my hair"". This was even before they'd been introduced. My gf had some stuff in the car and brought it in, she said it was fine but it was kind of awkward. I didn't want to make things worse by having a full blown argument with my mom on the first time shed met her. Anyway the whole treatment took over an hour and my gf said it was easily a 200 dollar job. My mom even had the nerve to ask her to do her nails, I couldn't believe it as I've never seen this side of her. She then said as she was leaving that she'll give her 20 bucks next time we see her. I was livid as she didn't seem like she put much effort into getting to know her at all. Anyway, my gf has 2 kids from a previous marriage I get a long with them pretty well and I was due to look after them, I phoned my mom and asked if she had any plans for the rest of the day and she said no. I drove the kids round and just told mom ""what better way to get to know them than looking after them for 24 hours"". I could see she was annoyed. She phoned me a few hours later and said that I should come get them, I told her I'd had a few drinks so can't but it's her job to look after children so I thought she'd be able to do it in her free time aswell, just like my gfs hairdressing. She got the point I was trying to make and she said I was well out of line for doing this. I told my gf about it and we both agreed that she's a bitter old woman who is selfish and vile who has a look in her eye saying that she hasn't been fucked properly in years.

I have three children, one still alive who is a 15 year old girl. I had her when I was 18. In 2008, I had another girl and in 2010 I had my son. 

About a year after my son was born, he quickly began to regress. He wasn’t hitting his milestones and my husband and I became increasingly concerned. After about an 18 month long battle with doctors, we received a diagnosis of INADS (Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy) which in layman’s terms is basically Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s for children. It’s a terminal illness, with a life expectancy of 8-12 years. I had prepared from the second we received the diagnosis to one day lose our son, and dedicated my life to becoming his caregiver, giving up my job and being by his side 24/7 to care for him. In January of 2019 he passed away. 

About two months later, our younger daughter was diagnosed with Glioblastoma Multiforme which is a malignant brain tumour at stage 4. I was still in a complete daze after losing our son but after six months of intense treatment, our daughter passed away. 

Towards the back end of last year, I went slightly off the rails. I was drinking heavily and smoking weed pretty much every night just to make me forget what was going on. My husband took the opposite approach and immediately went to therapy, as did our eldest daughter. In January of this year, I decided I was going to get my shit together as my 15 year old daughter is still depending on me, but I refuse to go to therapy or talk about my children. 

This has obviously caused some tension between my husband and I, and his parents. His parents are living with us at the moment, much to my dismay, and try to bring the children into every single conversation we have, which I cannot stand. Last night during dinner, I ended up snapping and telling his parents that if they kept bringing them up they should leave. 

It led to a huge argument between my husband and I, with him saying I’m being selfish in my grief and that I should allow his parents to grieve in the way they want to, even if it comes at the expense of myself. I ended up leaving and staying the night with my parents who live a few streets away. My husband has been sending me pretty harsh messages all day, as have his parents.

My company has gone above and beyond to cater to the people who have kids, which is totally understandable. Flexible hours, last-minute changes, etc. 

We've all done a pretty good job of switching gears here. Most of our Zoom meetings are done within 30 minutes to save everyone the trouble. We do weekly one-hour check-ins to make sure everyone know what everyone's up to, if anyone needs help, etc.

Jamie has three kids. Two of them are old enough to where they're doing virtual school, and are polite. The third kid, the youngest, however, is in that bratty little kid phase where they make nonstop noise, and if Mom isn't paying attention, it's the end of the world.

We're *tried* to be accommodating. But every meeting, when it's her time to talk, it's endless screaming and MOM MOM LOOK AT THIS MOM WHY AREN'T YOU PAYING ATTENTION and then ""cute"" interruptions like the kid getting up in the camera so we see up his nose, yelling HI over and over when she's talking etc. 

She's been told a number of times to please make sure she carves this one hour out of her week so we can work together, professionally, as a team. Yet every week she gets all sheepish and ""I just can't so no to him"" and shit like that. 

I finally snapped this week. I'm waiting on a huge project from her, and she needed to explain where she's at so I could be prepared for the hand-off and to take control. In the middle of her explanation, the kid just starts going ""WEEEEEEEEEEEEE"" as loud as he can in the room, swinging around a toy. 

I couldn't hear shit except the ""wee!"" and I just... I'd had enough and muted Jamie and said ""I'm done wasting my time here, let's move on until Jamie finds a closet to lock that kid in so we can actually get some work done.""

Other people on the Zoom call either cracked up laughing or looked uncomfortable. I get it, putting her on the spot like that was rude. But at the same time, forcing the constant ""WEEEEEEE"" and noisy interruptions and ""cute"" antics of the kid on your coworkers who are just there to get work done is beyond obnoxious.

Jamie went off crying to our supervisor, who ended up saying essentially the same thing as me, just with more tact. It's been an issue since this all started, and I'm not the only one who has lost their cool with Jamie over it. 

However, *some* of the people with kids (not all of them) have ""banded together"" to complain that we're putting too much pressure on Jamie and that it's unfair to expect she would be able to ""just turn off being a Mom"" like that. 

All I'm asking for is a for a quick, professional meeting. None of this ""WEEEEEEE!!!!"" and ""cute"" interruptions by someone's kids. AITA?",2020-11-10 22:06:23,316,650,0.93,22,0,58,51,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bf is pretty short at 5’5 and is kind of shy. I think his height is fine since I am only 5’1 and he isn’t shy when it’s just me and him or other close friends. My mother is always asking me if I really am attracted to him saying things like”Don’t you think he’s too short for a man?” or mistakes his shyness for being boring. Well the other day I got to my breaking point. She was asking her usual stupid questions but I couldn’t handle this disrespect towards my bf any longer. She was saying”Really baby, why him? You could have much better men. My friend has this tall, handsome dentist son who has seen a picture of you and thinks you are cute. You are missing out.” This obvious disrespect upset me a whole lot so I said to my mother”I’m with him for his long fat beautiful dick. You happy to know that now? I doubt Mr.Dentist is even half as big.” And I ain’t lying either, all that missing height went somewhere else.

Since quarantine started, my mom (47F) has had the privilege of working from home. Almost every day, she makes me breakfast. At first, it was nice, but after a while, I told her that I (18F) will be moving out soon for university and I'd like to learn to make my own food (at least my own breakfast). I told her that if she really wants to, she can make breakfast over the weekend, but during the weekday, I'd like to make it myself. She agreed. This was back in April/May 2020.

Over the months, regardless of me telling her not to make me breakfast, she makes it and brings it to my room. Throughout the months, I've also told her multiple times that I don't like it when she brings food (whether it be breakfast, lunch, or dinner) to my room because it makes my room smell, distracts me from my work, and makes me feel guilty. Every time she brings food to my room, I end up eating it whether I'm hungry or not just because I don't want her to feel bad.

Sometimes when I'm working, she brings up lunch/dinner, and although there are times where I thank her for bringing me food, most of the time, I remind her that (1) I want to learn how to remind MYSELF to eat to prepare myself for moving out and (2) the other reasons I listed above.

Despite me reminding her hundreds (I swear I'm not exaggerating) of times to not bring me food, she still does it. This morning, I had an 8:00 am test for one of my classes. After coming out of the shower, I saw that she had placed breakfast on my desk. My room smelled like food which was created a distracting atmosphere for me to write the test. When I went to pick it up, the knife slipped from the plate (she gave me pancakes) and fell onto my carpet, spreading syrup everywhere.

I had 5 minutes before my test started at this point, and I was really frustrated. After quickly cleaning up the mess, I went downstairs and I yelled at her telling her that she needs to understand my boundaries and keep to her word. She has said multiple times that she will not bring me food and yet she keeps doing it week after week.

I feel bad because it was a thoughtful action and I love my mom, but I have told her so many times on multiple occasions to stop. Reddit, AITA?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**UPDATE**

Last night, I apologized to my mom for yelling at her about me dropping my knife. I told her that it was my fault, and I shouldn't have gotten upset at her over that specific point. I also explained to her exactly why I didn't like her making me breakfast (most of the reasons I outlined in my comments). She apologized and said that she'd try her best not to continue making me breakfast and let me figure it out on my own at my own time. She also said that she continues to do it because she feels bad when I don't eat right when I wake up. I explained to her how it makes me feel nauseous and sleepy, and how that's a bad combination before 8:00 am lectures. 

This morning, she made me a heavy breakfast. Take what you want from that. 

Thank you to all those that provided their opinion, I really appreciate all perspectives. I tried to respond to the most common perspectives as well. 

**EXTRA INFO**

1. I didn't mention my struggle with mental health to paint my mom as the villain after I noticed that people were calling me TA. I came here fully prepared to be called an asshole. I didn't mention my depression or OCD just so people feel bad for me. I mentioned it as a context - I've requested her to change her mindset on mental health and she hasn't. I thought it was necessary to mention that, as this breakfast request seems a lot smaller in comparison. I'm sorry if it came out as if I wanted her to look like a bad person, she's a lovely mother in many aspects, but she has a hard time to change her mindset on certain things.
2. I don't have any history of eating disorders
3. I make my own lunch and I help my mom with dinner most days. I also eat dinner with my family. I'd eat lunch with them too, but my mom prefers to eat in her room, so I usually eat lunch alone in between my lectures.
4. I usually don't eat breakfast in the morning, which is why I've asked her not to make it. Whenever I am hungry in the morning, however, I put together something to eat, as long as she hasn't already made me food. 
5. I have been 'enabling my mom' because wasting food is a big NO in my family. No one else will eat her breakfast (since she doesn't eat breakfast, and my dad makes his own early in the morning), some not eating the food would be considered a waste. I could put it in the fridge to eat as lunch, but that would take away from me wanting to make my own lunch as well. 

Many of you have been calling me a spoiled, entitled, brat. I respect your opinion since I came here fully knowing that I might get stuff like that. However, I do think it's important to note that ONE situation doesn't define a person. In this particular situation, I may have come out as a spoiled brat, but that doesn't make me one in general. Again, nothing I can do about that since that's what I came here for. 

As for my mental health issues, I've been seeing a therapist and trying to work things out with my mom. Thank you to all of you that shared their own stories. I hope you all can get a good, homemade meal soon. Take care!",2020-10-28 15:05:21,523,1359,0.93,50,4,80,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He’s part of the family now, and I consider him to be my little brother. I (26m) usually (pre-c) would hang out with him often, and throughout quarantine we’ve been playing video games and voice calling several times a week, as he needs a big brother figure and I’m happy to be his. 

My wife (27) and I have known him since my sister met him at school when they were 12, and he was always frighteningly thin. Turns out it was because of lack of nutrition, and once my parents took him in and fed him properly he was a healthy weight. However his bio parents gave him some messed up views about food that led to him developing an eating disorder when he was around 14-15, and he’s been working on this and other things with a therapist, and he’s doing really well now, and I’m glad. 

Main point of that paragraph ^ is that my wife knows how much he’s struggled as she’s witnessed it all with me, and should know not to comment on his eating.

This thanksgiving my parents, K and R, and my wife and I got tested for you know what, and we were all negative, so we decided to have a socially distanced thanksgiving in my parents backyard. Things were great, R was eating a good amount, no one said anything because of obvious reasons, and life was good. Until my wife starts in.

“Wow R, you’ve really come a long way from when we first met you. Remember when you would only eat if someone gave you permission? Haha, glad you’re not like that anymore. (She said a few other things like this but I forget the exact words she said. Just bringing up past things he used to do for his ED that he’s obviously sensitive about.)

My parents and sister were just kind of in shock, and R’s face was red and he was just kind of looking down at his plate. I figured no one wanted to say anything to my wife, so I did. 

“Why are you being such a bitch? The past is the past, just let people eat. It doesn’t matter anymore.” 

My wife looked at me with a shocked pikachu face, and left the table to sit in the car. I finished eating (we were almost done), said goodbye to my family, apologized to R for my wife’s comments, and went to the car to meet my wife. She obviously called me an AH, and I said I didn’t regret calling her what I did because she was being a bitch and should’ve known not to say that.

Me: Its inside but the delivery guy is demanding a tip but I’m trying to explain I don’t have anymore money

Brother: Yo, my guy, we don’t have anymore money, so if you could kindly fuck off.

My brother and the delivery guy started arguing a bit and my brother started cursing him out, but I just said sorry to the delivery guy and closed the door. My brother called the dominos and complained about the guy, then we just ate pizza.

So AITA? Should I have handled this any differently? I feel bad but still a little mad.

Ps. I live in the US, and I couldn’t go pick up the pizza because there was no car to use so I could pick it up.",2020-10-02 16:36:33,1826,2603,0.93,0,0,112,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’ve been with “Ry” (nickname) for 5 years, engaged for 2 and living together for 3. Ry is 27.

Ry has really been my rock; she encouraged me to go university, let me move in with her when I couldn’t cope with my parents and gave me the push I needed to accept myself and be happy, she’s just this great woman but maybe I’m biased!

We’ve never been a family to really celebrate birthdays, I’d get something small and a card and that would be it. But for whatever reason my mother wanted to celebrate this birthday and I agreed, let her and my sister (30F) arrange everything.

A week before my birthday I get told that Ry wasn’t invited because my grandmother and mother don’t like her (age difference and they think she “turned” me) and that maybe we could do two meals, one with my siblings and Ry and one with my family but then my other sister texted me, an hour later, saying she’d talk to the family about inviting Ry.

A few days before my birthday she said it was a no go but they’d arrange something else to include Ry.

Ry was fine with not being invited but I’m not, I just decided to drop it and just didn’t turn up.

Now my family are texting me saying that I’ve embarrassed them and that I could’ve done something with Ry later on and that I’m being manipulative. I’d ignore this but Ry is upset that I’ve made them think she’s behind this and they’ll blame her for it.

**Sorry for not making it clear, I am a woman, not a man, so yes them accusing her of turning me is them accusing her of turning me gay**

I've long wished to name my child a certain name, lets say that it is 'Tom', after my grandfather who basically raised when my parents dropped the ball.

&#x200B;

The thing is that my sister-in-law lost her baby five years ago, let us say he was named Thomas. Thomas died in his sleep when he was four months old and the whole family was devastaded. I know that his death still causes them very much pain and I get that they don’t want to be reminded of him dying all the time. So, I asked them if it was okay that I named my son Tom, since it is a similar name to their son. 

&#x200B;

Me, my husband, sister-in-law and her husband had a long and tearful conversation about it where they gave us their blessings. However, a couple of weeks later,  I hear that she has been telling her mother and father that I'm being very selfish and inconsiderate, and that she could believe I was doing this to her. When I confronted her with this, she told me that of course no one would be okay with such a thing and that she hopes I lose my child and see how that feels.

&#x200B;

And let us just say it escalated to a lot of screaming from both of us. I'm considering just sticking to the name, because the whole thing has left me exhausted and is not the first time she has done something like this. But then again she is grieving woman and this is a difficult matter, 

&#x200B;

We barely have business, maybe 2-4 customers every hour, so we try to help people are much as possible since we’re able to. 

This story happened literally 20 minutes ago. 

Lady walks in, I’ll call her “CL” for “Crazy Lady” for short, and immediately comes up to me as my manager is on break. 

“I need help, now,” CL says. 

“Absolutely,” I say back. “What are you looking for?”

“I have breast cancer, and I’m starting radiation soon, so I need a comfortable, supportive bra to wear that won’t irritate me.”

I walk her over to the bras that I show every woman in the same situation. She hates those. I show her another section, she hates those. I try to ask what in particular she hates about each bra, and she doesn’t have an answer and insists I show her more. 

So I continue to point out different bras, offering various reasons why that one would work. 

Eventually she goes, “this is fucking ridiculous. You clearly don’t know your shit. Bring your other coworker out because you obviously don’t know shit. No wonder you work retail.”

I immediately started laughing, but blurt out “Excuse me?” in between giggles. 

She then gets angry and says “oh, so now you’re laughing at me because I have breast cancer? Real nice.”

At this point, my manager comes out and CL proceeds to say how I refuse to help that customer and I laughed in her face and that I made fun of her for having breast cancer. CL then makes the difficult decision to tell the manager I should be fired, oh so sad. And, of course, she wants a discount. 

My manager, not wanting a scene, goes to the back to grab a 10% coupon code just to appease the situation. 

In the meantime, CL looks at me all smug and goes, “I really hope you can survive in this world without asking $10/hour.”

So, here’s where I may have been TA. 

I go... “You really think I give a fuck about this job? I work here once a week on the weekend to help my manager while I have my full-time Monday-Friday job. Working here to help ape-shits like you who have no respect for others is the least of my worries. Have breast cancer all you want, you’re going to die a stuck up bitch one way or the other if you keep treating people like this.”

CL instantly starts crying and runs out of the store after telling me she’s calling corporate. 

My manager walks out, asks where CL went, and I tell her everything. She knows I work to help her out and that I give no shits about the store, so she understands, but then says I was way too harsh on her and will have to look into this now.

Everyone knew this and the family decided to make this about them and bury him and have some bullshit funeral service with a bunch of shit he told them not to do. He specifically said to just cremate him and dump his ashes near the USS Lexington. Incase you aren't familiar, this ship has probably seen the most action of any ship in the US navy being involved in most of the major pacific naval battles. Having lost many friends there and working on the ship for over a decade he obviously has a deep attachment to it.

Well after he died, I tried arguing with everyone about it but it didn't matter, her kids (my aunts and uncles, mom and grandma died so they didn't have any say) decided to throw this large funeral and make it really more about them. I told them they're all selfish pieces of shit for not respecting his wishes. They didn't really care.

A week after the funeral my dad, brother, and cousins dug up his body and got it cremated. We then drove like 10 hours to Corpus Christi, Texas where the USS Lexington is and we scattered his ashes around it, walking around it on the pier scattering it from one end to the other.

I'm not sure how my family found out, but they did and they are fucking pissed. They are threatening legal action against and are starting a shit ton of drama over this saying we are disrespectful. I told them they're all pieces of shit and they should rot in hell for not respecting our grandfahter's wishes on how to be burried and they're all selfish cunts. Thanksgiving is likely going to be a lot smaller, and my aunt is threatening divorcing her husband Dale over this as he helped us. I told my aunt Sally she's a fucking cunt and selfish sack of lard. She told me she just gave away my christmas present to charity. Half the family hates the other half now

Ray lives with her sister (30F) who wasn’t home at the time. Before moving from the living room to the kitchen, Ray lit a scented candle within reach of my daughter, who was watching TV there. I advised her against this but she brushed it off. Five minutes later, my daughter began calling for me. We rushed back to the living room to see a small fire had started on the table, which we put out immediately. My daughter had burned a halloween decoration on the candle which caused it. She was fine, but it left a small mark of about an inch on the wooden table. Ray was freaking out because it was her neat freak sister’s table, and I both apologized profusely and offered to buy her a decoration piece to cover the mark. After coming home, I texted another apology and even offered to replace the entire table. She declined both times and insisted her sister would ‘get over it’.
Since then, Ray has brought it up in multiple conversations, jokingly calling my daughter an arsonist and an ‘evil child’ on various occasions. She also makes sure to let me know about every time her sister gets angry at her for the mark on the table, which I DID offer to replace. Today she called and told me how her sister yelled at her again, saying to control her guests and that my daughter and I aren’t allowed back. I’m not sure how many more times I can keep apologizing, and how much longer I can keep hearing about the damn table, but the fact that she won’t let it go makes me wonder if I’m in the wrong here. AITA?

EDIT: Thank you for all your replies so far. I am completely aware that it was highly irresponsible of me to leave my daughter alone in that room, and I’m so grateful she wasn’t hurt. As a first-time parent I’ve learnt from this experience. 
As for the table, I’ve decided to contact the sister directly and just tell her that I’m replacing it instead of offering to. I appreciate everyone’s help!",2020-11-21 11:14:45,101,568,0.93,19,1,3,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To put it in simple terms I(34m) cheated on my ex-wife(35f) with her best friend/my current wife(33f) and divorced her 5 years ago when the affair was caught, asshole move I know, but what's done, is done. This situation happened four days ago, I had just finished drinking tea with my son(6m) and sent him to his room for bed, now my current wife has an obsession with making fun of my ex's current life situation(it isn't the best) and whenever me, her and her parents have tea/any food together she shows use her Social Media, highlighting how her life has gotten worse and so on. So my in-laws were over and we were having some dessert together and my wife did it again, and she and my in-laws got some laughs making fun of the ""whore"". I might not be the best man in the world but I had to put my foot down on this one, I told them bullying someone based on their Social Media can only be so ""funny"", now it's just petty and annoying. My wife burst into tears(she's currently 6.5 months pregnant) and my father-in-law berated me for a good ten minutes saying how dare I take the side of the ""whore""(my ex).

All my other in-laws said I acted like an ass, in my opinion I was just speaking my mind, AITA? need an outside view of the situation

She’s now in her first serious relationship, and has been with her boyfriend (21M) for 3 months. I asked her if they were sexually active and she said yes, but he doesn’t know about her herpes. 

She said that since she’s on suppressant medication that he’d never know, and it’s very unlikely he’d get it too. However, it is still possible to give it to someone even on suppressants. I told her she needs to tell him as soon as possible so he doesn’t give it to anyone else. She said that she’d only do that if they break up and was very upset that I was pressuring her. 

I went behind her back and told her boyfriend over facebook.

I was raised single handedly by my mom. My mom didn't have any siblings but she had a lot of very good friends who were always around while I was growing up. I consider all of them family. 

One particular couple, Susan and Tom (I call them aunt and uncle), are very close to my family. Since my mom was estranged from her own family, she made sure that Susan and Tomorrow become my guardians in the event of her death. 

She passed away when I was 15. Soon after that, Susan and Tom took me in. Things were hard at first (I was grieving, they had kids too) but we all made it. One of the things that helped the most was support groups. 

I met my friend, Kate (16F), at this support group. She also lost her parents 3 years ago. Her parents wanted her father's brother and wife to be her guardian upon their death but apparently they refused to take her in. Their grandparents were in retirement homes and no adult (friend or family) helped her. She also told me she thinks that her uncle stole a lot of her money that she is supposed to receive when she turns 18.

Kate had to go into the foster system and she ended up in a group home. Her foster parents aren't evil but they do the bare minimum to pass the inspection. Some of the older kids in the home aren't really nice. After few fights, the therapy and support group was mandated for her. 

We have only spoken over the phone as everything was online. We really bonded, but we weren't able to meet until restrictions were lifted. I have spoken about my family but I don't think I mentioned that fact that they weren't related to me. 

My Aunt suggested that I invite her to visit and I did. She visited one Sunday. Things were fine at first but I could tell that something was annoying her. She was becoming increasingly snappy as the day progressed. 

We were having dinner and we were all talking and then she suddenly exploded. She slammed her hands down the table and told us all to shut the fuck up and started screaming at us. 

She said that they weren't my real Aunt/Uncle and that weren't a real family, so we should all stop pretending to be one. She said that having pictures in the living room, having dinner together was just trying too hard. She said that her parents had family while my mother didn't even know who fathered me. She said that this is the life she should be having and I should have been the one in the group home. 

I got pissed off and told her that she was just jealous. I told her that my family may not be ""real"" but at least they love me. I also said that it wasn't my fault that her parents didn't have anyone who loved/cared about them/her enough to help her or take her in. 

She stormed out after that and I immediately blocked her everywhere as I didn't want to talk to her again. 

My Aunt thinks that what I did was right (edit: feeling like I was intruding or imposing on them was a very real fear of mine and something I have confided to Kate.) My Aunt feels I snapped and defended myself because it's a touchy subject for me but my Uncle thinks that I was too harsh. 

I just wanted to ask opinions. Even if you disagree with what I have done, I kindly request you to not be rude.

She has also victimized herself and blames my dad for everything that went wrong in their relationship. In reality my mum was a very controlling person, she consistently started petty fights with my dad and she was pretty abusive towards him. (I don't think I can go into the details on this sub) So today I snapped and told her that the reason she got cheated on is because she treated my dad like shit. 

We got into a big fight and my mum called me a traitor and kicked me out so now I'm staying with my dad who has thanked me for defending him.

Devastating for the whole family including my hubby (46m) and my kids (13f and 15m). I am going through chemo and it is awful, but I try to put on a brave face and keep things as normal as possible for my family. Rarely let them see how sick and tired I feel. I save my ugly crying for when I’m alone in the shower. When anyone calls and asks how I am I give the standard “I’m fine! Don’t worry! Chemo isn’t so bad! I can do a lot of things myself! I don’t need anything!” I hate asking anyone for anything. I’m trying to maintain my independence as much as possible. Not so for my mother n law. So when she had a party (which we would not attend due to the current situation and my immunocompromised health) she asked me to contribute by making my specialty dish. I flipped out! Who asks a sick person for a favor? Even though I say I’m ok, it’s because I don’t want anyone to worry. But doesn’t everyone know without being told how awful chemo is? Isn’t it common sense? Whatever little energy I have is reserved for my kids, not catering a dish for a party. I saw this as just another selfish request from mil. Hubby of course doesn’t see anything wrong. We’ve been arguing about it. He says I cook and bake at home and for my family, and he is tired of me bringing it up and dwelling on it. I say he is so easily manipulated by his mummy. He has such a blind spot when it comes to his family. If I say anything about his family he takes it as a personal insult. I say his family is my family and I’m allowed to call out when something is wrong as many times as I want. I can’t believe he’s defending her on this when my days could be literally numbered. So, AITA?

More info: sorry left out the request was made to my husband who relayed it to me. I’m not really upset with mil. Moreso hubby who said “so what? big deal you cook for your family” when I wanted/needed him to say “ya that’s kinda out of line for her to ask” and shut her down when she asked him. He knows very well living with me that I’m not well. He’s the one I’m mad at. Mil doesn’t even check in on me that often- she’s called me once a month maybe. I haven’t said one rude word to her.

Edit #2: Thanks everyone for the responses. Quite a variety of responses and no clear consensus so this is all clear as mud in my mind!

I learned I need to be more honest with how I’m feeling. I really will try. Honestly it’s bc I don’t want to alarm my kids. For everyone else, I just can’t stand the pity. I don’t have the energy to console anybody else. Some of you will know what I mean. It’s easier to just say “I’m fine” it’s how I cope. I’m not a complainer and those who really get me are still incredibly supportive. Just knowing I have cancer and I’m in active treatment is enough for literally everyone else in my life to ask what they can do for me, not what I can do for them. 

Thanks everyone who wished me well. The kindness of internet strangers really moved me. To those who really believe I’m the AH, thanks I will try to be more honest with how I’m feeling. But would you really ask your sick friends to cook for you? Seriously?

My mil is self absorbed and always needs a favor. She has a history of making unreasonable requests with wide eyed innocence and dumbass hubby falls for it every time. I’m not so easily manipulated though. So, no, this was not her being kind to include me. 

I get I maybe overreacted but I’m dealing with a lot- all my long term plans have gone up in smoke. I lost my breasts, my hair, my nails, my looks, my stamina, my strength, my financial security.  There is not one part of my life, not one cell in my body that cancer has not touched. I will never have piece of mind again. This monster will chase me for the rest of my days. I live in constant fear my children will be dealing with lifelong grief and the emotional scars that will leave. I have nightmares of my babies saying goodbye to my emaciated body on my deathbed. So, no mother dearest, I can’t make mushroom risotto. Dumbass hubby has firsthand witnessed to my mental and physical struggles, and he has been incredibly supportive except for with his mum. It’s so weird he’s super defensive of her. It’s a total blind spot in his judgement.",2020-10-24 20:24:43,331,1760,0.93,43,16,73,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There’s nothing wrong with him, I just don’t need a dad or another parent. My biological dad was an alcoholic asshole. He cheated on and emotionally abused my mom for 15 years. She finally left him when I was 6 and my little sister was 3. Since then I’ve relied on my uncle, my dads brother. He’s been a mentor and a father figure to me since my mom got rid of my dad.

My step dad tries to be a father to me and my sister. My sister really loves him and calls him dad and everything, which is cool for her, but he’s not my dad. He will never be and I’ll never call him my father.

He tries to weasel his way into my life and act like he knows what’s best for me. I recently got cheated on by and had to break up with my girlfriend. It’s been pretty hard. I’ve been talking to my mom and uncle about it since it happened, but 3 days ago my mom refused to talk to me about it. She told me that she’s not going to be able to relate as well as my stepdad would so it’d be good for me to talk to him. I told her I wouldn’t.

I then called my uncle and he told me the same bullshit. He said that he thinks it’d be a good idea to talk to my stepdad and that he’s been in my life for 9 years so I should give him a chance. I hung up. Eventually my stepdad came up to my room and asked if I wanted to talk about it. I got suspicious and asked him if he had spoke to my mom or uncle. He caved immediately and said he asked them to direct me towards him because he really wants to help.

I told him roughly this. “You need to stay the fuck out of my life. You’re not my fucking dad, so stop trying to be. I don’t want your advice or your help or anything. If you want to pretend to be a father go talk to Ash(my sister). I don’t want shit from you.”

He apologized for everything he did and left. 2 hours later my mom came to my room and went off. She told me my stepdad was downstairs crying about what I said. She said that I should be ashamed of myself and that I’m a ungrateful brat and need to learn respect and apologize to her husband. I refused. She then grounded me until I apologized. I still haven’t. Even my uncle thinks I should apologize.

earlier this week, i went to a hair salon close to my house, it was one of those franchised hair salons that have multiple locations around my city. i usually keep it pretty simple, short on the side, long on the top, like a pseudo undercut but without the fade.

as i was getting my haircut, my stylist was talking to another stylist and not really focusing on what she should be doing, which at that point, cutting my hair. she kept looking away to gossip to her co-worker. well at one point when she was trimming my sideburns, she looks away again to talk to her co-worker, and ended up buzzing off a clean line from my forehead to just about past my ear.

and i'm not sure if you'd believe me when i say i'm normally a pretty calm and composed person, but i freaked out. probably the most I've ever freaked out on another person, and my last girlfriend cheated on me, and i wasn't as angry as i was at that moment. 

I hopped out of the chair and this is from the best of my memory but i said:
""what the fuck are you doing!? why the fuck are you talking to your co-worker when you should be paying attention?! look what you did! how can someone mess up this bad?!? what the fuck is wrong with you??? are you freaking new or some shit? did you just recently graduation hair cut school?? (not sure what its called)""

she started apologizing and tried to get me to sit back down saying she can fix it, but i didn't trust her anymore, and i demanded someone else take her place and i quote ""i need someone who actually knows how to cut hair, i'm not sitting back down and have your incompetent ass continue to cut my hair! do you think i'm daft or some shit???"" she just hung her head down and looked like she was about to cry, and admittedly i wanted to cry too. luckily another stylist just finished her client and so she finished up the job, not like there was any way to fix it, so she buzzed the rest of my sides and back down and to match the length of the mistake (ie, removed the hair since trimming settings on the clippers take it down to nothing) now i look like a freaking paintbrush.

after everything was all said and done, they comped my haircut, but i still tossed a few bucks to the stylist that attempted to fix it. and i asked for the contact information for the manager and i was on my way.

i contacted the number later, and they told me they were already aware of what happened and it's being investigated.

now what brings me to why i made this post, i was telling my friend about what happened and he thinks i was a major asshole, and i didn't need to freak out that bad. and that ""you probably costed that woman her job, over hair that'll grow back!"" yes, i know it'll grow back, but it's called doing your job, and not being distracted while cutting someones hair jfc.

People decided now that what Dominos did was unacceptable and are boycotting them. My MIL is one of those dumbass motherfuckers and when she was over at my place she got really triggered when I said I ordered us some dominos pizza, around 6 other people were at my house. She explained why and I laughed my ass off thinking it was a joke later realizing it was serious. She demanded I order other food for her because she won’t eat dominos. I told her no and to piss of, she wanted to eat my leftovers and I said no, I’m eating them for breakfast tomorrow.

She is pissed because i won’t give her other food options and she refuses to order her own food. She eventually left and is pissed at me because her husband didn’t want to take part in this insanity and stayed over. My wife is pissed because she said i brought on an unnecessary conflict, but i say tfuck that because this is so ridiculous, there was nothing political and it happened in 2012 for fucks sake. These people are a bunch of fuckign idiots holy shit. My wife wants me to apologize to my MIL and i told her i won’t because this is fucking stupid. MIL refuses to see me until i do and I see that as a win win.

EDIT: stop saying i ordered dominos to piss her off, I didn't know about this boycott until the pizza arrived",2020-11-15 20:28:24,218,148,0.71,16,1,35,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I  (25M) met my girlfriend (24F when we were in college, let's call her  Liz. We're both in different cities.

During our college years, I would throw her birthday parties with a few friends. They were fairly simple, nothing too fancy, but Liz is very appreciative even of small gestures. This side of her has always had a special place in my heart.

Liz's birthday was a week ago, but I couldn't make it because I was attending in-person classes in another city. I  told her that I would come this week to see her and we would have a  little dinner and a small cake to celebrate. Liz was a bit upset that it wasn't on her actual birth date but she was excited nonetheless. My classes were hectic and I spent most waking hours studying and Liz has been very supportive.

I  kept telling Liz that it was going to be a casual affair, and Liz was excited. I didn't have time nor money (college amirite?) to make reservations, I didn't know the city that well, so I found this nice restaurant. I didn't check if they did birthday stuff, so I had the back-up plan of taking her elsewhere for cake. To be fair, I didn't tell her that the restaurant may not do birthdays, and my plan wasn't exactly air-tight either.

We met up for dinner. She was dressed really nicely and I was dressed casually. The waiter said that the place didn't do birthday parties.

Liz's expression turned from excitement to anger. I was also a bit disappointed, but I had a backup. Liz said, ""you promised me there was going to be cake"". 

I  apologized and told her that she knew how hectic it's been for me and that I had a backup. Liz gave me the silent treatment, and I felt that she was being unreasonable, but I wasn't going to let anything ruin her birthday.

I tried to find a more immediate solution. The waiter told me I could bring a cake to the restaurant.

I returned to Liz and told her that I solved the issue, her eyes lit up and she was happy for the rest of the night.

She video-called me later that night and talked about what had happened, how she got upset because she had high expectations, how she made efforts to dress up and look good, how I  didn't deliver on my promise, how I always do something special, and that this birthday was tainted by my screw-up.

Ngl, I cried because I had never in my life seen her act that way, and it was like emotional whiplash. I told her that things didn't go exactly as planned but the evening turned out to be amazing.

I  told her I didn't get where all this aggressive behavior was coming from. Yes, there were hiccups, but we managed to do everything that I  said we were going to do. Liz kept reiterating her previous points until I just lost my shit and started yelling at the top of my lungs, telling her that I felt hurt. I hung up the phone and left it at that.

My brother Jake (18M) and I (17F) had the same dream college, H University. Also, in case you’re confused by the ages, we’re 1.5 years apart, but I skipped a grade so we were in the same grade for nearly our entire life. Jake was way more passionate about H Uni than I was. He had several H merch clothing, and kind of just assumed he was going there. For example, in conversations he’d say things like “Once I’m at H....” or “After I go to H, my plan is...”. Basically, his life plan rested on him going to H. 

Jake and I got along pretty well, we’d sometimes give each other advice or study together. However, during college app season, he got super competitive once he realized I was also applying to H. He’d refuse to study together, look over each other’s essays, and he’d constantly tell me to not even bother applying. 

Then, decisions came out and we opened them at the same time. I was accepted, and he was rejected. Jake had a massive panic attack, and instead of celebrating my acceptance with my family, I sat in my room all day because Jake would get furious when he saw me. 

I once even caught him trying to unlock my laptop to decline my offer, since his friend dmed me to warn that he had been talking about doing that. My parents obviously punished him for that, which made it so much worse. When my H sweatshirt came in, he screamed at me for “showing off”, when I just put it in my closet. He told so many people that I only got in because I was a girl and that H mixed the siblings up. 

Honestly, I felt bad for him because I would be crushed too if I were him. Everytime I tried to get him to stop, it got worse.  So I just kept tolerating it. I thought it’d get better after the summer, once college actually started. 

It has not. Now it’s really set in that he is going to a (good imo) state school, and not H. His anger is largely compounded by the fact that he’s going to the same college that he used to condescend other students about aiming for. 

My classes start soon, so I’ve been setting up in our study, which I share with Jake. Both of our rooms are tiny, with no room to study in, so we share a study with two desks that face away from each other. Jake cleared out my whole desk, and broke my lamp in the process. He says that I need to study in my room, so he can use the study without distractions for his classes. We’ve always both worn headphones, there’s literally no distraction. He just doesn’t want to see me taking classes at H. 

I’m so fucking done, I just want to be proud that I got into this college and actually learn shit without my brother screaming at me about it. 

Where IMBTA: We got into an argument, and  I told him that of course he got rejected since H didn’t take toddlers. I’ve also been wearing my H sweatshirt around the house constantly, which he gets angry about. He kept bothering me, so I superglued H rejection letters in the drawers of his desk, so he has to see them when he opens them.",2020-08-30 13:00:32,2038,25583,0.96,2,0,105,40,,,,,,,,2,7,,,,,,,,,1,5,2,1,3,4,,,,,,,,

Or at least I sure thought I was in a relationship; he said we were never in a relationship.  We went out on dates, I met his family, after four months of dating we were having sex, spent loads of time together doing a variety of activities- you know, a relationship.  

I got pregnant. He was not happy. I told him to be diligent about using condoms. A few times right after I had finished my period, he didn't want to use a condom but made sure he used them when I was ovulating. That's on him.  He asked me to abort. I said no, but that I'd release him from responsibility if he wanted to not have part of the kid's life.  I thought that was more than fair.  But he said he'd coparent and still *kinda* wanted to be in a relationship with me. I think I was very kind and patient with him having mixed feelings.  

Towards the end of the pregnancy, he said he didn't want to be present for the labor and, frankly, I was relieved, but I would've let him be there if he wanted to. So, get this, I go into labor and he chose that time to say he doesn't think it's his baby. He's going to want a paternity test.  I said no problem, we'll definitely get the paternity test and then made him leave the premises while I was waiting for my best friend to drive me to the birthing center.

I most definitely did not have sex with any other man in the entire time we were together.  So......the paternity test said.....No, it wasn't his baby. I swore to God it was a mistake and we needed to do a second one to clarify. I also feel like he should've been emotionally intelligent enough to tell that I was deeply committed and in love with him and that I didn't cheat on him.    

But that was it. He broke it off with me, never to speak to me again. I moved home to Minnesota to have the support of my family. My brother is doing a wonderful job of being a paternal figure to his nephew. But here's the deal. The now three-year-old is a dead ringer for him. He even has deep red hair like him and unique green eyes and that aquiline profile.  There's no doubt. Mistakes are made and that lab most definitely screwed something up.  He looks almost like a twin to a cousin he has (I spied on that family on Facebook). I keep his pics set to private in case he or his sisters ever check me up. 

Edited to say: the rules say I'm supposed to be clear on why I might be the asshole.  I've deprived this man of knowing that he has a son and deprived them of having a potential relationship, at least for this phase of life.  I've also deprived myself of child support by doing this.   

Edited again to say:  Don't know if child support is enough to disrupt the child's life and having to ship a kid from the Mid West to the west coast on a regular basis.

posting since a similar post showed up/ exactly how we felt when it happened. 

When my daughter was 9 she was riding in the car with my MIL and they got hit by a truck and passed away. I was a wreck, my wife was a wreck and we are still actively grieving the loss of our baby Katie to this day. When it happened my SIL said that it was our fault for not giving her our child when she was born. 
She didn’t attend my child’s funeral. 


A year later SIL announced she was naming her baby Katie after our baby so there could still be a living katie in the family. My wife flipped and begged her not to. SIL accused us of being selfish and said we where just jealous she could finally raise Katie like she deserved without us getting in her way. Most of the inlaws stopped speaking to SIL since her announcement.  


Her child is now 10 and we’ve have not spoken to SIL since. Shes blocked in every way we can. Last year my wife decided to make amends with her dad and we’ve slowly begun letting FIL back in. Last month we lent him a spare garden hose and he dropped by to return it, he brought SIL’s kid over since he was baby sitting and tried to introduce us thinking we’d forgive SIL. When I got home from work FIL was in the kitchen with my wife while the kid wandered the house. We still have some of Katie’s things up, including her soccer trophy with her name on it. She asked about Katie. I sat her down and told the kid about the tournament and finished by telling her she is only named Katie because our daughter passed away and her mother named her that to spite my wife. SIL’s kid looked at me funny then nodded and left with FIL when my wife was done talking to him. 



Yesterday FIL called us and started screaming how his granddaughter wants to change her name because she thinks it was stolen and now SIL is angry and her new husband thinks shes a monster and hasn’t come home since the kid told him about the visit. My wife said that karma finally caught SIL and how shocking it was that the kid had a decent bone in her body after being raised by SIL and a few other choice words about how he always favored SIL over her even while SIL made our grief all about her and stole our baby. By the end of it all my wife was sobbing. 


I might be the Ahole because he never would have called if I lied to the kid or threw them out, on the other hand she asked and FIL brought the kid over knowing we never wanted to even see its face or SIL again after everything that witch did to my wife.",2020-10-30 01:02:43,217,1113,0.96,31,1,36,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My daughter (15) has been doing commercials, modeling, and acting jobs since she was 6.

Since 2020, my husband’s income has been cut even more. I don’t work and have never worked. As such, most of the money we use has come from my daughter, who says she wants to use her nest egg to help us out with stuff like rent for the house we live in right now, utilities, and bought me a really nice tote for my birthday. 

My daughter has worked non stop for nearly ten years and now she wants to have some fun with her friends. However, my husband decides to get strict and tell her that her curfew is 11pm.  

She decides on Monday to go out with friends from the neighborhood. My husband texts her at 11:05 and says if she’s not home in 15 minutes they were going to have a problem because she didn’t call ahead.

She sends back“ I’ll be home when the Uber I decide to call pulls up to the damm driveway. Don’t forget to turn off the lights I pay for.“ 

She gets home at 12:30 and my husband is mad at her snark and her rule breaking and grounds her for three days.

Tuesday morning he goes away to see his mom with cancer. He calls later saying that he’s going to be gone for a couple of days because she’s in bad shape. Tuesday afternoon, I tell my daughter that I’m ungrounding her and that her dad was wrong to ground her. And that we cannot begin to repay her for her support. 

I feel like my husband’s curfew is stupid because she’s homeschooled and doesn’t need to wake up early. 

Second, my husband tries to treat her like a child, yet apparently thinks she’s adult enough to pay nearly all our bills. 

I think it’s hypocritical and that the “my house my rules” is being abused because our daughter is the one paying for most of our expenses from her own money.

AITA? I feel like my husband is robbing our daughter of her agency and this is a shitty way of repaying her for her supporting us until he finds better work. 
 
My husband found out she was at a house party through Instagram and is texting me angry messages but I texted back that he had no right to ground her in the first place.",2020-09-24 23:18:48,1182,3081,0.91,154,0,2,62,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jvji7a/aita_for_calling_my_cousin_a_wannabe_edgy_failure/,AITA for calling my cousin a ‘wannabe edgy failure’?,"My parents and their siblings immigrated here from India and are fairly stereotypical Indian parents with high expectations.

My cousin didn’t meet said expectations. She nearly failed out of high school and now at 20 is going to community college. I don’t think going to community college is inherently a bad thing— if you don’t have money or do have it and just want to save it, or if you need to stay close to home, it’s a great option. However, if you literally almost fail out of high school and have to go to cc because nobody else will accept you, that’s another matter. So what I’m saying is, I don’t look down on community colleges, I just think it’s bad she almost failed out of high school. *High school.*

Anyhow, over the weekend I received a likely letter (basically a guarantee that you’re going to be admitted to a college before acceptances are officially send out) from NYU Stern, my dream school. We had a family zoom session to ‘celebrate’ (I personally don’t like being paraded around for their clout, but if it makes them happy, I’m cool with that). 

My cousin was making a lot of stand-offish comments. I recognized she was jealous because when we were young she always wanted to get into a prestigious college and have people praise her. And she didn’t get that, and I am. 

Anyhow, it was annoying how she kept derailing everything with her petty comments, so I told her if she had something to say, she should just say it. She said I was a ‘clone with no personality’ and a ‘lack of original thought’. Basically she was saying I couldn’t think for myself and was just a sheep following indian parents’s expectations. 

This annoyed me, so I just pointed out that it was funny she *wanted* to be where I was today, with good grades and an acceptance to a good college. She just couldn’t get in. So she wanted to be ‘a sheep’, she just failed, and if being a sheep is so bad, how bad must one be to fail at that? I finished off with saying she was trying to be edgy and alternative and ‘woke’ but was just doing that to mask the fact she failed. 

This caused her to start crying and storm off (she couldn’t leave the zoom because her parents were on it with her). My parents think I was too harsh, but her parents think she started it.

I was a 20F and in college. I was living with my two best friends. One of them was moving out so that she could move in with her boyfriend. I placed an ad looking for another roommate. 

That's how I met Erin. Before she moved in she informed me that she was vegetarian but she wouldn't have a problem if other roommates weren't. She moved into our apartment a month later. 

The next day after she moved in she cooked breakfast for us. I was surprised. We didn't ask her to and by her own words ""she wanted to do something nice"". 

She had made pancakes, bacon strips and hash browns. I am deathly allergic to few things. 

So, I immediately asked her what was in the food, but I didn't mention my allergies (huge mistake). She listed the ingredients and I didn't find anything I was allergic to. [Edit: she told me it was regular bacon. Not that it was fake bacon or that it had soy]. I start eating and everything tastes a little off. I try the bacon and definitely something is wrong. At this point, she does a "" Ta da"" and smugly  told us ""I bet it tastes exactly like meat"".

I am freaking out now. I told her I am severely allergic to soy and asked her whether there was any soy. Now she is apologising and says she didn't know and that she is sorry she lied and blah blah. I am experiencing anaphylactic shock: throat closing up, dizzy, the works. My bestfriend freaks out and calls an ambulance. I had to stay in the hospital for 2 days. With the US healthcare, the ambulance + my hospital stay racked up a lot of money. Money that I didn't have. 

In the meantime, I also filed a complaint with the police. Food tampering is a felony. I had a lucky break: my best friend had filmed the breakfast to post it on Instagram and she got the whole thing in video. 

In the end Erin had to plead guilty to some low degree of felony. She didn't get any jail time, but got community service. Once she was found guilty, I sued her for the hospital fees. I won that one too. 

[I did all the legal things under the advise of my Uncle's friend who is a lawyer. He said something about how it will be easy to sue if she had a guilty charge. I also did not have any contact with Erin during any of this under the advise of my laywer].

Erin's scholarship was cancelled and she had to drop out. She also went into dent paying medical fees. I saw her on Facebook few days ago and she is still down on her luck. I guess a felony charge makes it very hard, no matter how small the charge was. 

I know she is the asshole for lying about food. I wanna know whether I am the asshole for everything I did after. Because bottom line is, I basically screwed a person's life because they put wrong ingredients on breakfast that they made only ""to do something nice"".

Edit: You guys are bitching like as if I wrote the law on food tampering or like I was the PP who decided what charges to file or like as I if I was the judge/jury that gave the verdict. This is a snorefest. Throwing the throwaway account. 

You guys can keep whining all you want but that doesn't change the verdict.",2020-09-13 21:29:18,2008,3489,0.84,42,0,56,46,,,,,,,1,,1,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first few years after my divorce, I had no issues taking my son with me on trips. But once I married my wife, my ex became extremely hostile and denied every single request to take my son out of state, let alone out of the country.

We initially tried to make do by taking local trips but my wife and I felt it was very unfair to my stepdaughter and our two younger children to miss out on these experiences.

So from the time my son was 12-18, we went on four big trips that were out of the country. And every time, I planned the trips on my custody days, and requested official permission from my ex which she always denied. And as much as I hated it, we went on the trips anyway.

I went back to court three separate times over the years to fix the wording in the agreement which I always lost.

At the guidance of our family therapist, I was always upfront with my son about why he wasn't able to come on the trips. And I also made sure I saved proof of my ex denying permission. He was upset but at the time, directed his anger at my ex and seemed to be understanding towards me.

But when my son turned 18, it all blew up in my face. He started attacking me for going on the trips. I tried to compromise by paying airfare for him to go to the same locations we went to. But that wasn't enough and I've since paid all his costs to go to New York City and Hawaii to try and fix our relationship.

But after every trip, he just comes back angrier because he wants the entire family to go with him.

My wife stopped working a year ago due to some issues. There is no way I can afford what he's asking.

I had to be firm and I told him he can accept my offer of paying for his trips, which are not cheap in the slightest, or not get anything at all.

And I told him he had to wait for the next two trips because money is very tight.

He did not take it well and now has involved my ex, her parents, my parents and it's a whole mess.

Was I the asshole here? I feel like I'm at a breaking point from the stress.",2020-09-16 13:55:51,1419,5214,0.97,26,2,65,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was extremely grateful for the clothes but soon enough the night turned into a fucking disaster, to say the least.

So, as I said, we arent close. With that said, I had no idea she was vegetarian. Not once was this mentioned in our phone call about dinner either. I made basic hamburgers and hotdogs on the grill because it was the absolute easiest meal to cook in large portions (I have a family of 5; she has a family of 4). She didnt even say anything while I was cooking.

Well, I put the dinner on the table and call everyone to their seats. Now, her two kids are eyeballing the food. They both want a cheeseburger. Aunt goes fucking ballistic and says she brought her own food because her, her husband and her two kids are on a strict vegetarian diet. She pulls out tofu. Her kids immediately sulk. It was none of my business though so I kept my mouth shut.

Well, until she started talking about meat, how its made/processed, where it comes from, etc. All while we are trying to eat. She then goes on to talk about the bacteria in meat and how it ""kills you"". So, my husband and oldest child refuse to touch their food at this point. Not because they dont want it because my aunt is losing her mind and being ignorant. So, I looked at her and said ""Hey, how about we shut the fuck up. You're vegetarian. We are not. Not only that but you're in my home and I wont let my family feel walked on.""

She packed her kids and left. Her husband is apologizing. Says he wishes he got to try some of the burgers I made, etc. I then start getting texts from my aunt stating that I disrespected her and embarrassed her after she did such a generous thing for me and that she wont be helping me out ever again.

My friend said he knew a girl that would be perfect for me, and I said not to bother as I would just get rejected anyway he said that there was no harm in giving it a go but I said I still didn't want to. 

He persisted and I got angry and yelled that I wasn't interested and that I've already accepted I'm never going to date since no women want me due to my height, autism, acne scars, and mild PTSD he said that I was being a jerk and he was just trying to help, then I said I didn't want it and he called me a Jerk and left. He said he'll be waiting for an apology but I don't really feel inclined for one since he shouldn't but into my business, AITA?",2020-11-14 13:22:45,110,417,0.94,2,6,6,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, I am in no way in the group that could be described as disabled. For my own sake I'm barely noticing it at all. However, this had lead to a lot of people asking whether I need support, or should contact the state for help given to disabled people etc. services and support I by no means need.   


A week or so ago a friend of mine (M30), who have another more severe problem, asked whether I've considered one of these types of state support. I got quite mad, and answered that ""I've got not intention of using services for handicapped people, and I get quite mad when you ask about that."" He answered that he had, and wanted my oppinion. Notice that he asked if I needed it, not stating that he considered it. Further, such a reaction apparently made med ableist, and showed how I looked upon those who need it. Just so that it said, I by no means look down upon those who do need it, and have worked for groups attempting to strengthen these services. I just find offending that one should out of the blue ask if I'm considering without me ever having talked about, or in any way shown a need for it.

I knew from what he told me that they had agreed it was okay for each to see other people, but he never told me if she did just that she claimed the baby was his. 

I don't think his wife is a liar, but I told him he should confirm for himself so he had no doubts going forward. For all he knew she could have been mistaken about dates or conception if she had any other partners. Really they both needed to know for certain. 

He was supposed to do it in private without involving his wife, which he did, but he started to feel guilty for doubting her once the results came back and confessed to having the test done and that it was my idea. 

My brother and his wife have now split again, and the entire family blames me, even my brother. They all say that I shouldn't have interfered or encouraged him to do the test, but I never forced him to do it. I made the suggestion and gave my reasons why it made sense, but he was the one who decided he needed it. That aside, I don't think he did anything wrong, so the fact that she got upset is on her, not me or my brother. There was nothing crazy about him wanting to confirm paternity since they had been split for a while, weren't exactly having regular sex and could see other people. 

My wife has also said she is bothered by my actions for the same reasons but some different ones. She doesn't like the fact that I encouraged my brother not to believe his wife or me encouraging him to do it in secret. She thinks I may have some bad views about these types of situations and would hide things from her. I know what she means, but all I was doing was trying to protect my brother and his interests. 

I'm not sure if I had it to do over again if I'd made a different decision, but I am not above apologizing if I was out of line and TA.",2020-10-24 02:07:57,286,894,0.96,14,1,31,31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I started dating Diana 4 weeks ago. The relationship was pretty good and I never felt the need to speak to her in russian as her English is good and I figured that if she doesbt know I know russian perhaps I can see if she's actually loyal or if she'll talk shit about me etc. 

We broke up when I found out she was  chеаting on me. I found out when she was at my place talking on the phone to a friend and she explained how she fucked another guy twice when I was gone and she was lonely and how she feels she made a mistake. I said in russian ""you're damn right you made a mistake and you can get oit of my apartment now."" 

She's completely shocked and is asking me how I k kw russian and wtf. She's cursing me out saying I'm such an asshoke for violating her privacy by not telling her I know russian and being able to understand her private conversations. 

I told her she has to leave or she'll be forcibly removed.

For context, we’re both in our early to mid 20s when this occurred.

My cousin is a loud and proud atheist and preaches about his atheism to anyone and everyone and tries to “convert” you to it as well. I’ve told him a hundred times to stop trying to change the family cause no one wants to but he insists on debating. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve called him the “preacher of atheism” cause he won’t shut up. 

No one in our family gives a damn that he’s an atheist. We just don’t want him to influence our kids as we prefer them to be raised in Islam. He deliberately goes against the parents wishes and speaks to the kids to ask for “proof” that God exists. These are 11-17 year olds. They are very impressionable. Needless to say, their parents are pissed. 

When they confronted him, he said that the kids asked and he answered truthfully knowing full well that the parents want the kids raised in Islam and would be against this. They don’t want the kids to doubt their religion because of his influence, especially when they love him so much and look up to him. They can handle answering questions from outside influences, but they didn’t expect it to come from him. 

This is where I come in. I took him aside and told him it’s not his place to parent other people’s children. For me, if I had impressionable teens, he would never see them again and I told him I wouldn’t be surprised if the  older adults refused to let him see their kids again. He got pissed and called me a bitch for that. 

Now the older generation have cut him off and told him that while they didn’t like that he was atheist, they accepted him anyway, but he crossed a line when he made the kids doubt Islam as well. He called me and starting ranting about how they are all discriminating against him because he’s an atheist. I told him he alienated himself when he decided to push his beliefs on these children. I also told him to raise his kids how he wants, but stay away from everyone else’s unless directly invited.

She had $20000 in ‘savings’ which came from our dad selling his home and giving her money but not me as he claimed I was financially stable and could wait til he died. Anyway sis gives me the money for safe keeping in case she has to file for bankruptcy (never happened). She asked me to put the money in a bank account. I did. Now I got wind of an investment opportunity and decided I wanted to invest 20 k in it. I had my own savings of 10 k and asked my sister if she wanted to put in hers. She said no way she doesn’t believe in stuff like this! So I said fine. So I put in my money and then here’s the AITA bit I ‘borrowed’ (without telling her) 10 k or hers. I then worked overtime like crazy, did freelance and paid the 10 k back into the savings account within 6 months. A year later I gave her $1000 because I felt bad about borrowing her money. I told her what I’d done and she blew up which was fair but I explained I was always going to pay back the 10 k in 6 months even if it meant selling everything. Anyway she was pissed but she got an extra 1000 so she was fine. I still have the money in my account for ‘safe keepin’ IDK why she does this but whatever. Now my investment has made a ton and I’m looking at buying a house. My sister basically started talking about what she was going to do with her half. I was like ‘what are you saying. It’s my money’ she blew up big time saying it was her investment too and I was stealing. I asked if the money had been lost would she expect me to give her 10 k back regardless and she admitted she would as she ‘didn’t ask for this’ I also pointed out I paid it back. But she says but they could be my savings and her original 10 k was invested. Makes no sense to me so I’m refusing to give her 50% and she and my mom and dad are all saying I’m the biggest ah out there and I stole my sister’s investment.

Early on in our relationship I told her one of my goals was to retire early and devote myself to my hobbies. I had decided to do this in my 20s and adhered to the FIRE methodologies (although at the time I didn't know it was called that).

Over the years I sacrificed many things in pursuit of this goal. I minimized eating out, forwent expensive vacations, strictly budgeted my expenditures, worked long hours to get promotions and bonuses, etc.

Anyways I am coming up on 45 and by my calculations I have plenty between savings, 401k, stocks, etc saved up to retire early (about 2.5 mil) and live off the interest alone. I should note I had a little over half that amount when we got married.

I decided I would like retire at the end of the year.

My wife and I each work (no kids) and split all expenses. We each contribute to our own retirement accounts, and then pool a determined amount each month together to pay bills and do mutual activities.

Under my plan, I would still make my contribution to our joint account and we would split all bills like we always have.

The issue is, my wife was never much of a saver, and as such has a small retirement account.

She is asking me to continue working and put the money towards her retirement. I feel she is asking a lot, because that means delaying the goal I've worked towards for so long by around 5 years. I hate my job but the pay is great so I've been biting the bullet and working there long hours.

I feel slighted because she never made the sacrifices I did to save aggressively, and now wants me to sacrifice more so she can get the same benefits as me.

I liked the idea of having kids because I do like older children (basically when they can wipe their ass and have a conversation about something other than Paw Patrol), but I am incredibly squeamish as a result of having a mild sensory processing disorder (I am also a picky eater as a result of it, which I hate). I literally gag and dry retch at the sight of blood/vomit etc.

She begged and pleaded with me that she would handle all the bodily fluids, and that all the diapers, vomit, pee, blood etc is on her and i would not have to do it. I didn't have to cut the cord, I could be up. by her head during the C-Section and didn't have to look down, I didn't have to hold the baby until they were cleaned up etc. She said if she was sick, she'd arrange for someone to look after those things (ie: her mother or aunt). 

I agreed, but made it clear that it was my condition of becoming a parent with her. I will work and support them, I will read to the child, I will feed them, I will change them, I will love them, I will do things with them, but I will not be patching up skinned knees, I will not be changing pee or vomit soaked sheets, and I will not be changing a shitty diaper. She insisted she will get up and do every diaper change, every spit up and vomit clean up etc.

I made my wife send me a text and Facebook message agreeing to this before we tried to conceive so I had it in writing and she couldn't try and say she didn't agree. 

We now have a 3 month old daughter. I adore her. But my wife is already ""over"" the agreement and calling me a shitty husband for not changing shitty diapers I tried once and literally had to run into the bathroom and vomit.

Basically a coworker of mine is a born again christian and he LOVES to talk about his connection to god, his “exclusive” worship group, his mentor, and a bunch of other stuff that makes me think Cult but that is besides the point. 

He was going on a daily rambling about the power of prayer and the importance of being connected to god and said something along the lines of “With prayer and Talking to god everyone can be happy and stop with that fake anxiety and depression bullshit.”

I suffer from some pretty severe depression and anxiety, i’ve made attempts on my life, and i’m honestly doing a lot better right now which is probably why i had the nerve to look him in the eyes and just say “God Isn’t real”. 

He didn’t take to kindly to that and while my other coworkers got a little giggle out of it, couldn’t help feeling a little like a dick. so.  AITA?

At this weekly dinner there’s usually my parents, siblings, theirs spouses and all the kids. This situation only pertains to my brother who I’ll call Derek, and my SIL, Gia. My brother (25) and his wife (24) , just had  their first kid at the beginning of the year. They’ve been married for about 2 years. Every time we’ve seen Derek and Gia this year, they spend the whole time ranting and raving about how great parenthood is, and my brother always goes on the longest tangent about how Gia is such a good mother and he’s so thankful she’s willing to stay at home with the baby, she’s so good at her “job”, blah blah blah. “Our baby is so smart he rolls over, he can do sign language” blah blah. I’m over all the bragging, have been for months. 

Two Sundays ago, we met for dinner as usual and my husband and I were sharing with the family that we think we’re done having kids (we have 3). My husband says our house is always a mess, we spend our off hours from work running the kids to their extracurriculars and if there’s time left, we’re cleaning or cooking. Gia says “You’ve gotta learn how to manage your time more wisely. I make sure the house is clean and dinner is on the table everyday before Derek gets home.” Well must be nice. First of all, you only have one kid, you have all the time in the world to manage. We work 40-45 hours a week, so at this point my husband is annoyed and I’m ready to leave. Gia continues her rant by saying she takes pride in being a “domestic engineer” and she thinks it’s very important that Derek comes home to a clean home and a put together wife. She also says she doesn’t nitpick or nag because that’s not a what a good wife does. She’s just happy to be alive☺️. Did I mention her only personality trait is being a wife and mother? Long story short, I lost it. 

To be exact, I said: 
“Well, if I had the privilege of sitting on my ass all day I’d be happy and put together too. We actually work and live in the real world we can’t play house all week. And you only have one fucking kid.” 

My brother refuses to come back to family dinners unless I apologize to his wife for cursing at her and recognize that being a SAHM is a real job. They always want to take away my role as Godmother. My husband thinks I should apologize too. I’m just so tired of SAHMs thinking they’re better mom because they actually have time to clean their homes and spend time with their kids. I have a damn job I can’t sit at home and slip while my kid is shoved in front of a TV watching Cocomelon. Honestly, it felt good to knock the smug looks off their face, but now my brother is saying I made his wife’s Postpartum Depression worse.

We're all experiencing cabin fever since it's been around 3 months of the semester and bc of COVID, none of us have in person classes so we go out very rarely and attend classes in our rooms via video chats.

I'm trying to commission as an officer in the military after graduation so many days out of the week I get up around 7:00am, meet up with other guys following the same goal and we train (PT.) Bc of this, I try to get into bed before midnight most nights.​

Both of my suite mates play video games. I didn't even bring my console up, but if that's what you're into, fine. The issue is that every single night they're up until almost 2:00am playing together and literally screaming as they engage other teams, die, win, etc. Every night as I'm trying to sleep this is what's going on, to the point where I can't even hope to sleep until almost 20 mins after they're done. Whenever I try to reason with them to keep it down, saying things like ""can you guys relax I'm trying to sleep"" they'll say shit like ""Okay so go to sleep"" and nothing will change until a little after 2:00am. After 3 months of tolerating it and showing up to PT exhausted, unable to perform well, last night I snapped. I was laying in bed when I heard one of them scream at the top of his lungs in a totally incoherent way, to the point where he couldn't possibly have screamed any louder. I walked out of my room, screamed his name, walked into his room and started screaming at him. I pushed his headset off his head, put my head about 1 foot from his face and started ripping into him, screaming about as hard as I could that he should ""shut the f*ck up,"" how ""I have goals"" and ""I have PT tomorrow which I'm going to have to miss because your fat unmotivated ass can't shut the f*ck up."" He sat there and took it and I started to feel bad when I realized he looked somewhat scared and didn't want to say anything back. I screamed I have goals which I'm not going to be able to fulfill when this is what is happening every single night, ""it's four in the morning and you're still f*cking awake keeping me up, have some f*cking self respect and if you don't find some respect for those around you"" and a slew of other insults. He started talking back to me after I laid into him for about 45 seconds, told me to close his door, and I slammed it so hard whatever was hanging on it fell onto the floor.

I considered buying him a bagel or apologizing but I realized I would only be doing that to restore some peace to our room, and that I'm not sorry at all, it was a long time coming, and he didn't even get nearly what he deserved for keeping me up past 2:00am every single night.

Basically this means that they are state schools but to get in you have to pass an exam which anyone is allowed to take. Its a bit complicated and hard to explain but basically the school I go to is super selective and a lot of people there are well off kids who went to private primary schools.

My friend (also 15f) is one such person. While she doesn't boast it or anything, she is a lot more well off than me. I live on a council estate in a town about 45 minutes away form London by train, which is where our school is, and she lives in a rich area of London.

Recently it was her birthday. I was planning to get her a bar of chocolate, because most people are fine with that and its relstively cheap too. However when I mentioned this to her, she asked me not to get her food, because she was trying to go on a diet. I said that was fine and asked her what she wanted instead.

The problem is, everything she suggested was WAY out of my budget. I told her I couldnt afford it and she went sort of quiet. She told me it was fine and just to see what I could do. When I got home that day, I sort of panicked. I had no idea what to do, and I reaply wanted to get her something. I told my mum and she said that if my friend couldn't accept what I could afford, then she would have to accept nothing at all. I thought this was harsh, but I didn't know what else I could do.

When it came to her birthday, I didn't have a gift for her. I gave her a card and explained it to her and she said thank you in that way that implies that she really wasn't thanking me at all. She hasn't really talked to me since. Another mutual friend messaged me to tell me she was hurt because she always gives me such good gifts and I couldn't give her one at all.

TL;DR My rich friend is annoyed because I didnt get her an expensive gift which I can't afford for her birthday.

I could be the asshole becausr she always gives me big or expensive presents and I can't repay her so for her it might feel like I don't care as much as her.

WIBTA if I tell her to stop being so stuck up and accept that not everyone can afford to get her what she wants?

EDIT: I want to clarify since a few people have mentioned it, the card was a completely normal birthday card with birthday wishes and everything. I explained why I didn't have a gift when I gave it to her - something a long the lines of 'I'm so sorry I didn't get you a gift, I got very stressed since everything you suggested was out of my budget'. This wasn't very clear so thank you for pointing it out.

At his current pay rate (people pay him to design them web sites), it'll probably be another 4-5 years before he can afford to think about getting his own place.

But my son doesn't seem to appreciate the help we're giving him. He doesn't follow anyone else's schedule, he doesn't ever seem to bother involving himself with anyone else in the house, and he's always complaining about us ""bothering"" him. He's up all hours of the night, he eats whenever he feels like it, ignoring our set meal times. He doesn't clean up unless asked. He occupies the bathroom when others need it. So on and so on.

Today I sat him down and told him that this is gonna stop. From now on, if he wants to live here, he's gonna sit with us at the table and eat when we eat. He'll pitch in more for upkeep. He'll come when called. He'll get up and go to bed when we do. And above all else, he'll stop complaining about having to deal with the reality of living with other people. He doesn't like that, he's free to find his own place and live however he wants.

He mouthed off as soon as told him this and said some very disrespectful things. He claims that no one else he knows has to live like he does. I think I'm being fair and that all his friends are spoiled.",2020-10-17 06:40:38,363,576,0.91,66,1,18,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I would not consider her weird or atypical by any means. We both are very normal and average, so at first I didn't believe her and thought she was joking when she said she liked the name George for our daughter. This came after we'd been discussing traditional girl names for our daughter, so it wasn't even like she'd been considering anything gender neutral previously.

There was no reason in particular for wanting to use George other than she liked it because it would be unique and she thought it would be cute. I disagree on both fronts, but more importantly, I was against it because it's going to lead to a lifetime of bullying. I can see our daughter hating us when she's older for forcing her to deal with a name that made her a target for bullies, and she would be within her rights if she did.

I told my wife my objections, but she insisted that we name our daughter George and kept aggressively trying to change my mind. That is when I said that only a lunatic would think naming a girl George is a good idea.

I have tried to backtrack some by pointing out that I never directly called her a lunatic but only said that someone who thinks it's a good idea is one, but that hasn't made any difference. The thing is I still do believe that it's a crazy thing to want to do and borderline parental negligence. I don't think a rational person would do it knowing the child will be the one to take the brunt of the pushback.

Maybe I shouldn't have said it, but sometimes the truth hurts and we need to be called out when we're so far out of line, which is what I thought I was doing here after she refused to listen to my concerns.

Things aren't great right now, but I'm still not sure if I did anything wrong here so I want to know if I am the asshole.

Edit: A lot of people are asking me why not use Georgia or Georgiana. I have already mentioned using a female take on George and she has said no. ",2020-09-18 01:27:21,940,2405,0.96,32,4,60,58,,1,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was a student who received at least high Bs but mostly mid to high As in high school and undergrad. This semester I have 2 100%s and an 82% in my classes. 

I don’t want to sound like that person who doesn’t take responsibility or blames other people for their bad grades but, I truly believe I am getting a bad grade in my one class because of the way the professor teaches, grades and assess our learning. 

Case in point the situation at hand: last week a ROUGH draft of our final essay was due. I by no means half assessed it but since it was a rough draft it wasn’t exactly my best work. This week we we’re supposed to be given another classmates fought draft to peer review. 

Instead of getting a rough draft I got an email from my professor stating my rough draft was not to her standards and I would not be able to participate in the peer review assignment. This resulted in a 5/10 for my rough draft and a 0/10 for the peer review assignment. 

I emailed her saying that I didn’t think it was fair to give me a zero for “missing” an assignment when she wouldn’t even let me participate in it. She responded saying that she didn’t think it was fair to make someone peer review my rough draft when it wasn’t very good. She added that a few other people were in the same boat and there were also a few students who didn’t even submit a rough draft. 
I responded saying I didn’t care about other students I cared about me missing out on points and not even being given a chance. 

I should add that I also work as a Graduate assistant and have access to a system that shows all incident twirls received. Sometimes during my office hours I go through and read them. I came across one from my professor about me saying I had sent her an irate email that was boarder line harassment (it wasn’t, the strongest words I used were unfair and ridiculous).I then reported her for blowing my email out of proportion. 

I was then contacted by the head of the department saying she had filed a formal complaint saying that she felt even more harrassed and targeted because I had complained about her. Am I the asshole for being upset I got a zero and reporting her?

Edit: in her email to me and her report on me. She mentioned she thought I was was getting “too worked up” over “meaningless” points.

Since it keeps getting asked: yes I have access to these reports and encouraged to read incoming reports.

The professor has no idea I have access to these reports nor that I read her report. She thought I was “retaliating” but complaining about her after having her report shared to me.",2020-10-20 20:07:34,279,527,0.94,16,0,19,12,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,

Over the past two years-ish she has taken up biking and has done it every day, in trails and paths around our town. She’s really good and bikes 20 miles every day. 

She uses my older sons bike. He’s 27, still at home with us. We bought it for him about 5 years ago when he expressed interest in getting into biking but he hasn’t used it. I mean literally has never once used it, I watched my daughter peel off the protective sticker over the seat and the plastic off the handle bars. 

When we were packing her things, I told her it was ok to take the bike as she’s the only who has ever used it and I packed it up for her and it’s now at her apartment. 

My son found out when he was out in the garage looking for a tool that the bike was gone, and threw a fit about it. He says it doesn’t matter that he’s never used it, or that his mom and I bought it for him anyway, it belonged to him and he wanted it back. 

My daughter is a people pleaser and offered to give it back but I put my foot down and told them it was ridiculous, she could keep the bike and if my son really wanted one and would use it, we’d buy him another for Christmas. He doesn’t actually want the bike or a new one, it’s just the principle of it. 

My wife thinks we should just buy my daughter one and let my son keep his, but why go through it if he’s never going to use it anyway? I think he’s being a brat, but everyone else seems to think I’m being an AH.

My partner and I have clashed over this friend before, she is a truly awful person. Not to my partner though, just to her own. She has cheated about 100 times throughout their four years and it is this moral issue I have with her. It’s disgusting. I had been swayed around to meeting her (which didnt happen for other reasons) as she is my partner’s best friend and is important to her.

However, i know she planned on sleeping with her partner’s best friend .. on her partner’s birthday. This happened. It was preempted, planned and the BF was passed out in the same room oblivious. This woman is garbage. Poor bloke.

Hearing this I am never meeting this woman, I do not want to associate with her in the slightest. However, and this is horrible for me, she is still my partner’s best friend, and I know she has got my partner through tough times. 

I have banned this woman from our future home for her morals.

My partner is very upset about this and is not happy with me being mean about her friend. I concede I did not need to be mean about her friend to her, I could have kept this inside, but I really really want my partner to drop such an awful person from her life. I am aware I could have handled that aspect better but AITA for banning her?

Edit: This isn’t about controlling who she is friends with - she can obviously be friends with whoever she likes. It’s about my home and my space and whether one person has the right to veto a guest.

Edit2: Someone pointed out that if she was a racist and not a cheat it would be obvious to denounce her. Just because the racism wouldn’t hurt me doesn’t mean i should not actively denounce it.

The day was going great and everyone was enjoying themselves. It was hot, so we all decided to go on the lazy river. 

As we were drifting down the stream, I ended up floating next to Jake, and decided to play a prank on him. I said “psst... Jake... Sally told me your secret.” This was just a joke and I wasn’t referring to anything in particular. 

Well, Jake flipped out. He spun around and yelled at Sally “why did you tell him my secrets you fucking bitch?” I immediately yelled that it was a joke but it was too late. Sally was crying, Jake was angry, and the day was ruined. We all went home and they broke up soon after.

70,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ju6bu0/aita_for_hating_my_wifes_private_journal/,AITA for Hating My Wife's Private Journal?,"Alright reddit, I made an account just to ask this question; here's the background:
My wife and I will be celebrating our 14 year anniversary this Feb, and throughout our marriage, particularly the first 5 years or so, my wife would write in a diary/journal. These were never hidden or kept secret and even when we dated, it seemed as though they were left out intentionally - left out before xmas/birthday with gift ideas, left out after a fight to know what the issue is...but also it was used to tell me really hateful things - how bad the marriage is, how she blamed me for the problems, how she thought about leaving. 

After a few years, I kept tabs on where each journal was (there were several), and just noticed movements of them. If the journal was left on top of the bed or table, I looked at it (and it was usually hurtful) but otherwise I wouldn't. My wife never told me not to read these and from our early years, I saw it as a passive aggressive way to communicate. However, the last 10 or so years, they've become very triggering - instantly anxious when I see them out or see her read them. So my impression on her journals are not so good at this point, then shit really hit the fan.

In 2017, I discovered that she had an affair from 2011-2014 and that it was with a friend of ours. I found out by accident (not by reading a journal either), and we've been working through the pain ever since. We've done counseling and we've done workbooks and my wife has really owned her poor choices. Part of our new set of boundaries was for her to watch an infidelity related video and journal about it, which she has done consistently. Where we have struggled is that she wants a private journal where she can ""spew the venom"" as she calls it, which I take as saying really shitty things about me in her journal. I have told her that it hurts me by what she writes in there but if she really wants to she can. She doesn't want to unless I support it (which for her means that I wouldn't feel hurt by what she writes), which isn't going to happen because I know what she will write and its hurtful. She has a lot of people who have tried to convince me that I am taking it too personal and that the mean things she writes are simply things she has to work through. I don't know if I really want to be married to someone who has that much venom to spew about me. 

So Reddit, Am I The Asshole because I Absolutely hate my wife's private journal?

EDIT: So I see a lot of people saying I shouldn't have read a private journal. Up until the affair was exposed, she had encouraged me to read them if I wanted to, at no point was this a private thing. Once we had our Dday and talked through the affair boundaries, we agreed on transparency. She can have a private journal that I won't read, I've encouraged her to password protect it if she feels inclined. However, the issue is she wants me to not hate her private journal, but I do.",2020-11-14 18:11:16,92,107,0.89,11,0,16,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'll try to write everything as straightforward as I can.

\-I sold my house in Kentucky in June 2015. It was as smooth transaction, although the new owners were peeved that I didn't include my drapes. The real estate agent explained that I had just purchased them and would be taking them with me. It did not interrupt the sale of the house, it was the most minuscule blimp.

\- After the sale, I remained in the town for one month while I prepared to move across the country. I spent the month crashing with different friends, instead of doing a 1 month rental.

\- In this month, I purchased the same curtains but now in a different color.  *I recognize that this is absurd. i just love the pattern so much that I couldn't resist*. They were from Anthropologie and for four panels, it was about $600.

\-During my rush to order, I did not enter my friend's address. They shipped to my old address.

\-Within two days, I left a note saying that I had something shipped to their address on accident to please reach out when it arrives and provided contact information.

\-After I saw from the tracking number that they had arrived, I left a second message. Again, I provided my phone number and email address because I didn't have a permanent address.

\-Still no response, so I spoke to the mailman who had delivered them. He said verified they were delivered.

\-I stopped by while the husband was doing lawn work, he said he wasn't aware of any package. He seemed sincere.

\-I moved to California, without my new curtains.

\-Fast forward to last week. I am redoing a bathroom and wanted to copy the layout from the Kentucky house. I'm surprised to see that the house is for sale, but I was SHOCKED to see my curtains in the photos!! Same color, same length, same quantity.

I plan to call her and as nicely as I can, request a proof of purchase. I don't have the speech planned out exactly, but ultimately I want the curtains to be dry cleaned and shipped to me. Had I just forgotten about them and never reached out to the new owners, that would be one thing. But she *knowingly* kept them.

AITA?

****EDIT FOR DETAIL ***** 
I never had proof that she had the curtains until I saw them in the Zillow photos last week. 

I contacted anthro to redirect the package but they couldn’t do anything because they were shipped via USPS.",2020-11-02 04:56:23,114,320,0.96,10,2,26,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s not any kind of moral reasoning or anything like that...they did it to lose weight. As soon as they decided to be vegetarian, they also got reeeeeaaaallll arrogant about it, too. They still, even four years later, will send me random articles about how my meat-eating diet is bad and comment regularly that maybe I would lose more weight if I cut out meat. 

I want to add here that they haven’t lost much weight, if any at all, on this diet. All they eat is pasta and bread, and still feel it’s necessary to lecture me on my diet simply because it has meat in it. 

Anyway, I host all of the family get togethers. Out of the 6 people that come to these gatherings, they are the only two that don’t eat meat and they expect there to be food there specifically for them. The rest of the family are big meat eaters. I decided early on that I was not going to make two full meals. Not only can I not afford it, they’re rude about it. They’ll call beforehand to see what I’m making and then decide if they’re coming based off of that. The last time, I offered to pick a separate pizza up for them and they could pay me back. They declined and then got mad that I didn’t order one they could eat and made a scene about it at dinner. They had obviously expected me to order it AND pay for it. 

I feel like it’d be different if they had, like, an actual food allergy or something. But this is just something they’ve chosen to do. Not only that, they use their dietary preferences to belittle others.

AITA for expecting them to bring their own food if they’re going to demand a dietary preference that no one else in the family shares?

A few weeks ago, I quit my job at a hospital, where I ran trays from the kitchen up to patient rooms. I have autism, and one of my stims includes quietly humming to myself to self regulate while I work. I also tend to make small frustrated sounds when I’m struggling with something. I’m not loud, but I get that it probably sounds a bit weird to people who don’t understand. I really liked my job and I was good at it, but I had one particular coworker who was particularly nasty to me.

OVER a month ago, I was working in the (very loud) kitchen and decided to take a break to use the bathroom. I was wearing a lot of straps from my various pieces of work equipment, and when I pulled them off they got tangled, so I let out a frustrated little yelp and was quietly grumbling to myself while trying to detangle. My particularly nasty coworker went off on a tangent about how “nobody wanted to hear me making noise” and I didn’t really say anything because I didn’t want to start an argument, but I did make a facebook post about how a coworker was particularly nasty to me and it hurt my feelings. I used a different name but it was probably obvious who I meant, since she was the only one who was outright nasty to me. When I quit I just stopped showing up, as my new job wanted me pretty much immediately. I forgot about the whole incident, and I wasn’t facebook friends with anyone from work, so I was happy to forget the place in total.

Fast forward to today, when the coworker commented on that facebook post with this:

“u made noises all the time and everyone was fed up with it. Sorry uve never encounted someone whos gonna be real with u so u dont continue to look like a fool but thats what u wanted apparently and thats exactly what u got.”

“we work in a hospital and he made noises everyday all day and in a hospital setting everyone questioned the reason he made noises”

“when ur making noises right next to me im definitely not going to mind my business...and im very aware u no longer work with us its been so peaceful since and this was brought to my attention so i had to address it”

Keep in mind, I wasn’t facebook friends with this woman. I wasn’t even facebook friends with anyone from the job. I’m also really active on facebook, so for her to suddenly find and comment on this post she would’ve had to go looking for my profile, scroll for at least an hour if not way longer just to find it, and then write all those comments despite not having seen or spoken to me in weeks.
i wasn't loud. nothing i did was particularly rude or especially off putting, i just tended to hum quietly to myself just because i was happy at work. I was never rude to her at any point. We didnt get along, so I made efforts to avoid her. My job was done ALONE, and the only time I was near my coworkers was when I stopped in the kitchen to pick up or drop off trays. I was polite to patients and friendly with the coworkers I got along with, and cordial to the ones I did not.",2020-11-24 03:02:29,48,107,0.87,0,1,14,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have been together for 6 years now. We are both avid pot smokers, and I’m talking maybe 10 blunts a day on average. 
  I personally have never taken a drag of a cigarette, even once. It’s always disgusted me and was a turn off. The 2 of us had an agreement in the VERY beginning before we were even together that if I was to be with her, she would have to stop smoking. I’ve caught her numerous times in the past with packs hidden in her car or her purse. Tbh, I don’t think she’s ever stopped since we got together.. 
So here we are at the end of November and she’s 7 months pregnant and refusing to quit smoking blunts because ‘it’s my medicine’. Now aside from DSS probably going to be in our lives the second this baby is born because he has THC in his system, do I really think she’s stopped smoking butts if she can’t even give up pot? 
At the end of the day, I will love my child no matter what and give him the most love I have to offer. But am I obligated to do the same for her? Am I the asshole for telling her I’m going to leave her if my child is born with abnormalities or deformities? Obviously this is stuff I should have considered before knocking her up, but things happen and here we are. I always held out hope she’d quit but I guess time got the best of me. I don’t even know what to do in this situation. It’s keeping me up at night and making me crazy going thru her stuff when she isn’t home. This is not how I want my child to start his life.

I think I might be the asshole because I want no part in co-raising a baby with someone who only cares about herself.

I am mostly the one in the family that is good with money so everyone recently asked me to look over their household incomes and build them a budget. When I got to my brothers I realized that about $300-$500 of all of his checks was being withdrawn every time. 
When I asked him if he knew where it was going he said to ask his fiancé as he didn’t know. I went to ask her and she said that she had been taking it out and putting it in a separate account for about a year now to build her daughter a college fund. I asked her if she had ever talked to my brother about this and she said no that she didn’t feel she needed to as he had taken on the responsibility of caring for her daughter (mind you this is not his child.) 
I kind of blew up at this point and shouted at her that not only was she stealing from my brother because he had not given his consent but that this was a needless expense. I help my older sister teach her three kids and her child and I can tell you now she’ll never have the ability to attend, much less the desire to attend college. 
My mother came in at that point (we all live together, but brother was away for work at this moment.) and stopped me, asking what this was about. Brothers fiancé was crying and told mum I had called her a thief and called her daughter stupid. Without getting my side Mum demanded I apologize and when I tried to explain she defended BGF and said my brother had a responsibility to the kid. I refuse to apologize but now my family are all mad at me and I have been asked to stay in the RV we own instead of in the house. 
The question is am I the asshole? I was only trying to stop an unshared upon and unnecessary expense they can’t really afford right now.

EDIT: it was pointed out to me that I could add to the context here. A lot of you have said that my brother could have dealt with this on his own. The reality is the he would never have confronted the situation no matter how he actually felt. I am literally the only person he puts the effort into fighting with. He cares more about his mining fantasies than his real life financial health.

Edit2: after my family cooled down my mother came to the Rv to inform me of two things. 1) while my brother did not know about the money coming out or where it was going she and my father were. 2) my father is coming home from Texas (visiting his father who is apparently about to die of lung cancer.) so he needs to quarantine in the Rv so “you have to apologize today so you can move back in.” 
I refuse to apologize even more now knowing my parents were condoning her actions and Andrew talking to my older sister I’m moving in with her and her family. We’re all cutting off our parents and brother for now which probably means they will have to find another option for FSIL’s kids school. 
As soon as I can I’m taking my card off all the bills and taxes and getting a cheap apartment till I can get enough saved to buy land. That’s going to be a whole nother issue when it happens.",2020-09-24 15:46:41,492,1974,0.95,144,0,18,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was scheduled to meet with three people within the actual office itself, and considering this was a job that could be done remotely, that raised my suspicion but I still decided to learn more about the position.

When I got there, the first interviewer (who was with HR) took almost 20 minutes to call me in. The receptionist was nice and all, and kept trying to reach out to them to see what was taking so long, but nonetheless that irked me the wrong way.

My interviewer eventually walked into the lobby and told me to follow him, no apology for the long wait. To describe him, he was a tiny guy, about 5'6, and spoke in that weird valley girl accent (important later). The actual interview went off the rails really quick. My interviewer was rude to me and cut me off a lot. For background, I live with my parents because they have health issues and I help take care of them, so moving out isn't an easy option for me or them. When the interviewer asked where I lived, I told him I lived with my parents in X town. He laughed and asked if I was too scared to move out.

I was still trying to be professional but he kept making snide remarks about some of my experience, the state school I went to, etc. I eventually got fed up and I felt like I wasn't going to get the job anyways so I decided to tell him ""you're being really unprofessional, so we're done here.""

He got mad and said ""so you don't want to meet the team you're interviewing with?""

I told him ""no, if HR is this unprofessional then I can't imagine what everyone else here is like.""

As I was leaving through the lobby, the HR guy followed me and tried to embarrass me by saying out loud to the receptionist ""he is no longer welcomed here, if he tries to come back in call the police.""

I told him to shove it and go make out with his boyfriend so that way no one has to hear his voice, then I left.

I had never walked out of an interview in my life, no matter how well or bad they went. I did kinda feel bad for skipping out on the other two interviews which would have been with some of the managers on the team I would be working with, but I absolutely hate most HR departments as it is since they produce some of the most toxic people, and if this HR guy was really unprofessional, I question the company as a whole.",2020-08-28 18:10:06,1117,6154,0.91,87,0,13,181,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We had this thing where we would drink and then drunk dial our friends.

This particular night, my friend wanted to call her brother, but didn't have her phone. She grabbed the phone out of my hands and as she went to dial, it slipped out of her hands, onto the ground, under the railing and down 18 floors.

I was furious that she had grabbed the phone out of my hands to begin with, because I didn't like her brother and didn't want to talk to him and then on top of that she dropped it as she was dialing him. I lost years worth of pictures and videos because I wasn't cloud savvy back in the day.

To this day, we are still friends but it gets brought up from time to time and we get into arguments over it. I still think she owes me a phone. Am I the asshole for thinking that she owes me a phone and being a little bit upset to this day that she's taken no ownership of this?

I get it - nothing good happens when you're drinking and drunk dialing but at the end of it, I didn't drop my damn phone - she did and I'm the one who had to pay to replace it. Didn't even offer sharing the cost. Just nothing.

EDIT: While this did happen years ago, it more so comes up now as a salty jab from me time to time - not an argument. Let me be passive! We are still friends but I still want her to admit she was an asshole, that she dropped it and that she could have helped replacing it. I didn't expect a brand new phone, but covering the cost for a new working phone, that is comparable with what I had, would have at least been nice.

Ok here goes.... my daughter is getting married on Thursday. Her father and I have been divorced for 15 years and have a pretty good relationship. My daughter and her fiancé have told everyone that only immediate family is to wear the wedding colors. Not an unreasonable request in my opinion. So her dad’s gf sends a pic of a shiny gold pants suit that she wants to wear to the wedding (gold is one of the colors as is navy and burgundy). My daughter reminds her dad that the colors are for immediate family only. She also tells the gf very politely the same thing. Everything seems fine. That was about a month ago. 

Two weeks ago I asked her dad if his gf found a dress yet. He proceeds to show me a navy dress! I told him that our daughter told him AND his gf that the colors were for immediate family only. He got very defensive and told me “she can purchase more than one dress. It’s not my place to say what she can and can not buy or wear”. I told him that if she shows up in the wedding colors I will make her leave, if he doesn’t like it he can go with her. 

Last week he tells my daughter that the black dress she bought along with the navy dress doesn’t fit and she’s having a hard time finding a cress for the wedding...... I call bs. 

Today the tux he ordered for the wedding doesn’t fit so he has nothing to wear..... again I call bs. 

If these two ppl try to ruin my daughter’s wedding I may just lose my shit. Her dad originally wanted to wear a gold suit himself but my daughter said no. I’m afraid he’s going to wear it anyway (yes he has one and it’s awful). I don’t understand why it’s so hard to do something as simple as renting a tux or wearing any other color. 

I am the one giving our daughter away, her choice. So it’s not like the ceremony would be ruined if he wasn’t there. I really want her to have the wedding she desires and deserves. But would I be wrong if I told them to go change??

Edit: I feel like it’s important to give some background here. I’m not trying to be defensive so I truly hope it doesn’t come off that way. When her father and I divorced he chose to not be truly involved. He only saw my kids once a year for approximately 8 years. He would make plans and then cancel only for my kids to find out later that he went somewhere with a woman. (I did not reveal just to be clear) It’s a sore subject with my daughter in that her dad has consistently put a woman he’s seeing before his children. My daughter feels(and I agree) that the choice to wear her wedding colors when specifically asked not to is not only tacky but disrespectful when there are literally hundreds of other colors to choose from. It’s not like anyone is saying don’t wear blue at all. She’s just asking that people who plan on being in the wedding pictures (dad and brother’s gf) not wear navy blue.",2020-10-07 00:52:57,364,758,0.94,37,0,28,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I visited my GP a couple days ago and he thinks it might be a gallbladder issue, so I've been on a plain food diet until I can some tests done. I've been eating 1 or 2 small meals a day which has left me unsatisfied and ravenous, but I don't dare eat anything else unless I want to be up all night in excruciating pain, puking my guts out.

After another day of pitiful meals, I was complaining to my boyfriend about how all I want is a big juicy cheeseburger or KFC (our favourite guilty pleasures when we order in), to which he replied that KFC sounded good and we should get it. I reminded him that there is no way I could eat fried chicken in my current state, so he said he'd just get it for himself then (as in, get it delivered to our house so he can eat it while I watch from bed).

And this is where the disagreement began. I told him that it's selfish to order the thing I'm craving for himself when I can't eat it. However he thinks it's selfish that I should deny him something he wants to eat just because I can't have it. I asked him to wait until I'm better so we could have KFC together, to which he replied that he shouldn't have to wait if he wants it now. I think he should show a bit of solidarity and forgo fried chicken for a few days while his girlfriend is stuck eating unbuttered toast, and he thinks I'm being controlling.

82,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/j1vkf9/aita_for_agreeing_to_a_trip_without_asking_my/,AITA for agreeing to a trip without asking my wife first?,"So let me begin by saying that this is my first post so I am sorry if I screw up anywhere. I am however someone who frequently looks at this subreddit and it is another post I saw today that was kind of similar though with some big differences that made me decide to post myself.

Me and my wife have been married for a little over 7 years and we have 3 kids 2 girls and one boy. Of course as you might imagine having 3 kids under 7 it all has a tendency to get a little overwhelming for both of us, but we are doing fine all in all. Our day to day is pretty similar to a lot of people I think. I work 50 or so hours a week and help out a load when I get home from work and in the weekends meanwhile my wife is a stay at home mom so takes care of the kids and does most of the housework. 

In the past 3 years my wife had 4 occurrences where she claimed she just needed some ""me-time"" and pretty much booked a short solo vacation the first time around only telling me a week before leaving. I was pretty damn mad obviously, however I figured she needed her time and while it was a big and very expensive hassle to get a babysitter in time that could stay full days while I figured out a way to get days off on such a short notice. Like I said I was mad, especially because of how she went about it not necessarily because she did it, we all need some me time now and again after all. The next 3 times 2 times she went with 2 of her friends and another one was again a solo trip, but all of them were without asking me.

I guess it is pretty clear where this is going. Now I work a shitload, when I am home despite sometimes just being exhausted I pull more than my weight to give my wife some breathing room. On the weekends I take on most of the care taking with the kids and do most of the chores, again to give her some breathing space and I got to be honest, sometimes it feels like she doesn't do the same for me in that regard as she seems to think I never need any rest.

Well a buddy from college invited me on a long weekend fishing trip, I haven't seen the dude for more then casual talks in the mall in over a year and I immediately said yes, I feel like I have just as much right to a short vacation as my wife and given she never asks me before hand, why should I do that? So I didn't really think of it as a problem. 

When I told my wife however she basically exploded, naming every little thing she does in the house and how ""It's not the same"" when I pointed out she has done this 4 times. When she understood I was going whether she liked it or not, she tried to get me to take our son because ""He'd like to fish with daddy."" I said no and it was for me to relax just as she got to.

So you tell me guys, am I being an asshole here? She sure seems to think so.",2020-09-29 08:51:45,345,1745,0.96,9,0,65,60,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While catching up I asked her how covid dating was going and she said she was seeing a guy named C, he was a cop and things were okay.  She didn't offer up much else then, and my kids kept interrupting so we moved on.
After dinner she and I were cleaning up and my family was downstairs and she brought him up again.  This time she mentioned she'd been seeing him 2 years.  I asked her if they had been dating that long why had I never heard of him or met him?  And she said well I didn't think it would last this long.
That's when I looked her dead in the face and asked if he was married and she nodded yes and I went off.  I asked her how could she?  And why about his wife?  And how the fuck could she start something knowing he's married and she will never be nothing but sloppy seconds and since honesty isn't his best quality there's probably more.  She will never meet parents.  She can never really have a nontoxic relationship  and it definitely won't be built on trust.  And how could she be so fucking selfish?  I'm a wife and she was my bridesmaid and how would she feel if she found out my husband had a TWO year affair behind my back?!?  Our marriage would be destroyed.
She is upset with me now, but I feel like she needed a come to jesus talk.  She said she accepted that she will never have what me and my husband have but I told her she never will have it if she treats herself like free salsa at the Mexican restaurant instead of guac.

We got married at 21 and had our daughter at 25. Last year, we were going through some marriage difficulties and decided a break would be in both of our best interests, we both just need a little time apart after being together for so long.

So we split, and in this time my wife felt pretty awful about herself (I initiated the break) and ended up hooking up with one of her longtime male friends and she got pregnant. At six months pregnant, we reconnected again and got back together. Her friend had absolutely no interest in the baby (he had begged her to abort) and told us he would not play a role in the baby's life whatsoever. We agreed and plan to raise him together.

Anyway, that's the backstory. It's been two months since then and we've been really late on the names, I know. The deal was I named our daughter Charlotte (my wife didn't actually like the name but she agreed so long as she got to name the next kid) and she can name our next child. She came up to me yesterday and told me she was reading a book and found the perfect name. I asked her what and she said ""Tuesday"". When she first said it, I admittedly laughed out loud and I asked her if she was serious. She said yes, she was, and it's her decision.

I followed her around the house and told her absolutely no way were we naming our son Tuesday, he'd get made so much fun of! My wife said no he wouldn't, lots of kids have unique names and aren't bullied. I told her that yes, UNIQUE names not days of the week. She wasn't hearing it and pointed out she hated the name Charlotte and agreed on the basis she would get to name the next kid.

I argued that's a totally different thing, Charlotte is a NORMAL name, our daughter won't get laughed at because of it. My wife got frustrated and after arguing on and off for the rest of the day she finally told me he wasn't even my kid. I just walked off and although she came right back and apologized and that she didn't mean it, I was fucking pissed.

I'm not talking to her right not but I'm holding steadfast we won't name him Tuesday. I don't think I'm the asshole at all but some ammunition would be helpful when I explain to my wife exactly why it's such a ridiculous name.

To start off my wife(28F Ally) and sister(26F Carrie) have never had the best relationship, they can be civil with each other but you can just feel the tension some times. Carrie can extremely judgmental when she's in a bad move and Ally  is not someone to hold her words, so yeah not the best combination. To elaborate Carrie has always had a height complex as she's average height but the rest of the family is tall. Carrie is more tolerable to us(the family) but not so much to Ally(also tall), she gets angry when Ally wears heels. If Carrie makes a snarky comment about it, Ally will call her out on it and a few harsh words would be exchanged.

Recently there was a small family gathering that my mom invited us to, we haven't seen her since before lock down so we decided to go. Of course Carrie was there and she was in a terrible mood. For context Carrie had just broken up with her boyfriend of two years and she was being judgmental about most everything but she especially feeling tolerable to intimacy between couples(except our parents). Now Carrie currently has a problem with the clothes Ally chooses to wear, Ally is stunning, has n amazing body and is not shy of showing off her curves. 

Carrie has been on a diet which seems to have something to do with her boyfriend breaking up with her. Ally wasn't wearing anything *scandalous*, just some ripped jeans, a sweat shirt and some ankle boots but as always she was fine as hell. Carrie had a problem with that and was pointing out how Ally knew what she was going through and still decided to wear form fitting clothing. 

Ally ignored her to keep the peace. Eventually it got to a conversation about how Ally was too vulgar and about our sex lives. Carrie was on full bullshit spiel mode and started criticizing Ally, saying was trying to seduce me all the times with the clothes she wears. She got to how much condoms we must go through and Ally broke and said my sister needed a condom for her attitude. 

My dad started laughing, and Carrie just kind of stormed off. We stayed for a little as Ally wanted to play with my niece, Carrie came down at some point and called me an a AH for not defending her. My brother said I was the AH for not tell Ally that ""she made an unnecessary comment"" as he put it. My mom told me I was the AH for not defending Ally before she made the comments, everyone else who my mom told the story to says that I'm the asshole for not defending Ally at any point in the conversation. Personally I think my wife is more than capable to handle herself and I did tell Carrie not to start anything with Ally before I left to play with my niece and I think Carrie kind of had what what coming to her.

I (21F) am roomates with another guy from college (21M) for about 2 years. We are both really chill and never had any problems. 

We have both stayed away from hard drugs but we do drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes and smoke weed. We have hosted some wild parties in this house. 

We don't host parties since Aunt Rona came to town but we both continued to smoke cigarettes and weed in the house. Neither of us had a problem smoking anything indoors and neither did our landlord (It's a crazy college town. He wouldn't have gotten any tenants if he said they can't smoke inside the house). 

Problem came in the form of his pregnant friend about a month ago. He said that she got evicted and that she was jobless and needs a place to stay for a few days urgently. I agreed. Obviously, we both stopped smoking inside the house. It was just for a few days, so I did my best to make her feel comfortable. But the more accomodations we made for her, the more she asked for. She didn't like when we played music or TV as she was a light sleeper and gets headache easily. The smell of meat makes her nauseous, so we can't cook or eat meat inside the house. 

Me and my friend just went to the roof when we felt like having a smoke. Days became weeks and I asked him when she was leaving. At this point, I am getting annoyed at not being able to do what I want in my own place. He told me how he is telling her nicely to leave without saying ""Get out"", but she keeps either begging for some more time or starts crying and he backs out. 

Weeks became a month and I have had enough. Since yesterday, I have started smoking inside the house. I mean, it's not like I deliberately light up when she is in the room. Ashtray is by the window, so I sit there and smoke when I want. If she is in the room, I just give her a heads up and then start smoking. I have also started watching Netflix on the TV when we don't have classes and started cooking meat in the house again. 

Yesterday night, she yelled at me about how an inconsiderate bitch I was and I reminded her that it's my place and unless she has paid rent that I didn't know about, she doesn't have a say in what I can or what I cannot do. 

My roommate is really nice and he tried his best to help a friend out (He isn't the father). But even his patience is wearing thin and he supported me. We aren't going to throw a homeless and jobless pregnant woman into the street but I am also done making adjustments to my way of living for someone who doesn't even pay rent. She can find a way to be okay with how me and my roomate live or she can find another place to stay. 

So, AITA?

Edit: PLEASE READ!!! Hey guys. We have decided to ask her to leave. Whether or not, she has things figured out, she has to leave in a week. 

She gets recognised as a legal resident if she stays for 4 more weeks. And me and my roomate really don't want that to happen. I do feel like an ass for this, but not enough to house a person (+ maybe their baby) indefinitely.",2020-08-27 09:29:39,953,6631,0.95,5,0,109,83,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We got married two years ago and I’ve been encouraging her to dress however she wants to. Her style still isn’t very revealing, but she shows more skin than her family would like (e.g. she wears sleeveless tops or skirts that go slightly above her knees) and her clothes are more figure-hugging now. However, she stills dresses conservatively whenever she knows she’s going to be around her extended family.

She decided to go home and tell everyone my wife was dressed like a \[word that would probably get this post removed\] and her father (wife’s uncle) called ME to lecture me about it. He essentially told me as her husband I shouldn’t want other men to look at my wife dressed like that and I should tell her to cover up more. I told him I liked when she wore revealing clothes and I was going to see if she would wear a miniskirt for me. He hung up on me after that.    

He’s since told the rest of their family that I’m a pervert and a disrespectful s\*\*\*. The only reason I think I maybe went too far is because my wife is pretty mortified, and my MIL told me I should’ve just corrected him without “stooping to his level”.

She is in her late 30's now and weighs more than she ever has, but she carries it heavily in her hips and butt. She is an attractive woman whose very employment is partially reliant on her physical appearance (not sex work) but she has a friend who is about a decade younger. When they met the friend was overweight. In their years of friendship her friend has become devoted to physical sport (including the one my wife introduced to her/""her thing"") and as a result she has lost weight, gained muscle, and looks very good. She, too, carries her weight in hips butt and thighs.

&#x200B;

The other day her friend came over to hang out. She talked about how much better her times have gotten and how much she dedicates to improving in various aspects. She has creative and intellectual endeavors. The two have a lot in common. As soon as the friend leaves, wife unleashes barrage of shit talk about how the friend is a poser, a wannabe, a try hard, how she's too skinny (she's not, the girl has visible abs and looks very fit) she even said ""real women have curves"" but they both have the same body type. After hearing her just shit talk her friend to death, I had lost it and told her she was being petty, mean, hateful, and small. I told her that I love her body but if she's uncomfortable with her weight (she is, she talks about it constantly) then to do something about it. I've seen her working out. She puts in half the effort of her friend, quits readily, makes excuses, and has even overblown medical conditions only to lose all symptoms as soon as she gets home. She claims to be an artist but she spends most of her time on her phone. She claims to be a pro at all the things her friend is actively practicing but she doesn't do any of those things and hasn't for most of the decade we've been together. I don't mind these things but this girl is a good person and a good friend and doesn't deserve to be treated that way, even behind her back, especially by her best friend. My wife doesn't work more than a few days a month and brings in almost no income. If she wanted to pursue anything, she is free to do it, but she instead chooses to complain and tear others down.

I've been staying in my office the last two nights. Am I the asshole for speaking up about this? I don't know if this is a typical behavior for female friendships.

&#x200B;

\*edit\* I love my wife. We have a very straightforward manner of speaking to one another. Our relationship is not in trouble over this, it is simply an argument. I am looking for advice on how to proceed. I do feel like an asshole but I feel she is being unreasonably cruel.

In our culture, a baby gets its head shaved at a year old, and usually for girls, their ears pierced around the same time.

This was done for me. And I'd like to think it's why I have amazing hair. And I'm also very happy that my ears were pierced when I can't remember the pain. I love wearing earrings.

So I'm not saying I would actually do this to my own child since I'm not religious, but I do respect that it's a very important part of my family's culture.

A co-worker of mine went on a tirade saying me getting my ears pierced as a baby was bad, which I highly disagreed with. Especially since my piercing will always close up and is not permanent.

I let it slide for a bit and eventually said we can agree to disagree. But he kept going and I said I felt it was very inappropriate for him as white man to be trashing my culture and that I felt he was being quite racist.

This definitely made him mad but he dropped the topic.

One of our other co-workers brought up this argument to HR. I was then interviewed and I confirmed what was said. My co-worker was let go.

This happened a year ago. But when I told my friend recently, she said I was wrong.

When we reopened months back one of the stipulations was we were not to serve out of the ceramic cups. Fine honestly I didn't like washing the ceramic cups anyway as I have never realized how disgusting the general populace is.

That aside about a month ago the company gave us the all clear to serve out of the ceramic if asked. One of my bosses has told us if we don't feel comfortable serving out of the ceramic cups we don't have to. All of us at the store don't feel safe serving out of the ceramic cups and really don't want to risk our health over a single cup someone got their saliva all over.

Back on monday I had a guy and his friend come in who was on vacation from california. He comes in and says 'can I get a medium latte?' I go 'sure' and reach for a paper cup.

""You can't use the ceramic cups?""

""We aren't serving out of ceramic due to covid.""

""But coffee tastes soooo much better out of ceramic than paper.""

""I'm sorry we are only serving paper right now because of covid.""

""Awe really you can't make this one exception?""

At this point I realized this was a fruitless effort to tell him no and made his coffee in the ceramic cup. He held this smug tone in his voice the whole transaction and I thought it was rude of him to expect a ceramic cup and not understand I didn't feel safe serving in ceramic. I didn't want to outright say 'I don't feel safe' but I feel like saying no and because of covid multiple times would have deterred him from insisting on the ceramic.

While I was ringing him up we were talking and he asked if it was state law we weren't serving out of ceramic and I said my boss told us not to. He made a sad awe and then I told him he can go to any restaurant in the city and he will receive a straw and plastic silverware with his entree.

However I made him the latte with decaf espresso. I was really irritated he wanted to risk everyone's health for the sake of taste and figured if he was going to be rude he should get decaf.

Note here I would never intentionally do anything to hurt anyone like giving them the wrong milk on purpose or giving them regular instead of decaf. That's the stuff of heart problems and lawsuits.

So after he left I went on one of my meme groups on facebook and shared the story with an accompanying meme just to get it off my chest. This one guy commented on my post and started laying into me about how I am a terrible person for decafing him and how he could have narcolepsy and how I put him at risk making it sound like I murdered him. I got really angry and told him to fuck off. The admins then banned me for 3 days for not being nice.

So AITA for giving a guy decaf instead of regular in his latte?

My (29M) best friend (28M) is getting married at the start of October at a smaller gathering at a family friend's banquet hall, catered by his family.

He's, obviously, gay. My mom is extremely homophobic and in poor health at 65, diabetes, obesity, family history of heart conditions and smoking. I'd be very surprised if she made it to another election cycle, 4 years.

She never liked my friend, but let it go once I became engaged to my current fiancee, probably because she thought I might be gay. I told her I was going to not only be at the wedding, but the *BEST MAN* at the wedding and she flipped out. My dad passed away about 5 years ago and provided very well for us, annuity, stocks and 2 property houses rented out and my mom knew the power that has. Even split with 2 other brothers, I'll inherent well over 5 million. 

Her words were ""if you go to that f@g wedding, we'll see how much you get"". Unfortunately, I told her the date before this point and she'll know where to expect me on that day. I've tried to get her to be reasonable but she isn't budging. She's been a bitter, hateful woman for 60+ years and she's going out a bitter, hateful woman.

I told my best friend and he is furious with me, as is my fiancee. We are very well off, I'm a pharmacist who hasn't felt the effects of COVID at all, to be honest, and she's a human resources associate. We are extremely comfortable and have never stressed over money, but not millionaires....which we could be.

I asked my best friend if he would consider a long engagement, him and his fiancee proposed and planned the wedding inside a year. And my mom is not going to last much longer, but he isn't concerned beyond ""you're choosing your homophobic mom over me""

That line hurt me and I'm just choosing her money right now, but even that doesn't seem like it is worth it. My fiancee has said she knows it is a lot of money, but she says we have 6 figures in the bank already and my job has no threat of downsizing or phasing out.

Still..... I would be set for like and take a 10+ start on my retirement. And he's not willing to find a compromise at all, not that he should have to at the end of the day.

WIBTA if I don't attend my best friend's gay wedding?

I come home from work at 11-11:30pm on average and my partner works 9-5. Previously I would finish early on a Sunday night and we would cook a roast dinner together and it was very nice, but now I’m coming home later, I’m not interested in eating a big meal and he is also pretty much drunk by the time I get home in the evenings.

Recently I’ve noticed the quality of the roast dinner on a Sunday getting worse and worse. Yorkshire puddings aren’t rising or being cooked enough, chicken is over cooked, and I’ve found myself basically ignoring the entire roast dinner, making a sandwich out of some of the dark meat that isn’t bone-dry and having it with some soup before bed.

He was getting upset that I wasn’t appreciating his effort, as he was putting in 4-5 hours prep work into the meal for me to just ignore it and leave it for him to eat as leftovers.

So I said that I wasn’t super hungry that late at night, that the food quality was getting worse because he was drinking more and that he should maybe not bother unless I get time off with him to cook it together.

He got really offended and said I was talking to him like I talk to my staff etc. And that I thought I was Gordon Ramsey when I’m just running a takeout. Which I thought was nonsense because I’m fair with everyone, but I just didn’t want to eat food that I didn’t enjoy out of politeness that late and ruin my sleep because of it.

He said he’s not going to change his roast making, even when I said I would give him recipes to follow l, shopping lists etc and pay for the ingredients. But I just can’t bring myself to sit alone at night and eat a reheated, overcooked, crap roast dinner at midnight after a busy weekend.

Even when I suggested he cook a brisket or roast pork instead of chicken because they “improve” if they get overcooked, rather than chicken which turns to chalk, and he took it as an insult for some reason.

Usually we hang at my place but last night, he thought it would be nice for me to come over to his apartment as his roommate was out of town visiting his parents. He wanted to cook for me, which I thought was super sweet until it actually happened.

So I went over and watched some TV while he cooked. He didn't want my help at all, which is fine with me because I'm admittedly a pretty shitty cook. Sometimes i'll make pasta but I do a lot of takeout. He made pork chops and sauteed some spinach. When we ate, he kept asking if I liked the food. The pork chops were great so I told him that. The spinach wasn't good, he used way too much oil but I didn't really care because it was really not that big of a deal to me. 

But he just kept asking if I liked the dinner. Like we were talking about work and then he would just bring it back to if I really liked the food. I don't know how many times I had to compliment his fucking pork chops. I was kind of picking at the spinach and he specifically asked me if I liked the spinach. I said it was good because I honestly didn't want to get into a whole thing about it because again, I really appreciated that he cooked in the first place and some oily spinach didn't matter and it was edible.

Then he was like ""You're lying, why are you lying?"" I then basically said I was eating it and I asked him why he was getting so fucking pissed about it. I was pissed off because he was getting so angry when I was trying to be polite and appreciative of his nice dinner. He told me that he didn't want a LIAR for a girlfriend. This REALLY pissed me off and I told him something like ""Fine, your spinach is fucking trash. It's garbage. ARE YOU FUCKING HAPPY NOW?"" I don't think thats exactly what I said but I was like beyond angry. He  got smug and smiled and was like ""I knew it. Was that so hard?"" 

Kyle can be stubborn and obsessed with being right sometimes but on the other hand, so can I. I told him that he can enjoy the rest of his shitty spinach alone and I bounced out of the apartment. We've both texted that last night was ""crazy"" but neither of us apologized lol. But anyway, AITA?

update: I showed Kyle this post and both of us are very amused that the final verdict is we both suck. We agree! All is well now and he wants you to know that the spinach wasn’t that oily lmao",2020-10-22 16:59:52,120,536,0.94,3,2,25,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(The ""black man"" she was referring to was actually a friend of mine who I explained this all to, later.) This woman was new here and worked a floor above me, so we didn't know each other well, and when she said that, it took everything I had to keep myself from slugging her.

My third wedding anniversary was this week. My wedding was absolutely beautiful and I am so happily married to my husband. With regards to guests, I explained to my family that we really only wanted serious partners to attend as plus ones, i.e. spouses and fiancé(e)s, to keep numbers manageable and make sure we didn't have random exes in various photos. Liam messaged us shortly before the wedding asking if we could extend that rule to include his girlfriend, as he would be the only immediate family on his own. We agreed. I had some vague idea of him having a girlfriend, but given how busy we both are and that we are both bad at keeping in contact, I didn’t know or question too much.

The wedding was lovely and went off without a hitch. Rose was a very sweet girl, very intelligent and kind and absolutely gorgeous, and she and Liam seemed like a very cute couple. We spoke very briefly about their relationship, meeting at university, together for a year and a half, and so on. There were a few cracks made about the wedding giving Rose some ideas, and that was really it.  I had no reason to interrogate them, of course.

Fast forward to this week and Liam and Rose are visiting my husband and I for dinner and drinks. We’re relaxing on the porch, a little tipsy, and Rose mentions Liam’s gift to celebrate three years together. Cue my surprise. Rose immediately realizes she fucked up and Liam is cracking up. I say I thought you were together more than a year at my wedding? And Liam replies no, me and Rose matched on Tinder two weeks beforehand and I invited her to your wedding as our first date. Apparently mostly as a joke.

I told him he absolutely should not have done that and that he had really hurt my feelings bringing a total stranger along to an important event for me and for our family. He replied that, with my reasoning, he had done nothing wrong as Rose turned out to be a long term partner and not a random ex – my point is, he had no *guarantee* that would be the case. However, he thinks I am being unfair being mad at a situation that ultimately turned out absolutely fine, and I’m not sure if he’s right or if I’m justified.

There is no chance of me cutting contact with Liam or Rose over this argument; just looking for outside perspectives and judgements. Am I being unfair?

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** okay, holy crap, apparently I majorly missed up with the phrasing of this post, so sorry if any judgements are invalidated when I say that I spoke to my husband and apparently we did not give ANYONE a plus one. We sent out invites to our guests and their partners \[Mr and Mrs John Doe, or Mr Joe Smith and Ms Jane Smith, for example\], there were NO invites labelled ""Mr John Doe and Guest"". This whole time I've been referring to ""our"" guest as the guest and their partner as ""their plus one"", which is apparently... totally incorrect, because they were named on the card. Apologies.

My brother was the ONLY one given a blank ""plus one"" card, and even then he had told me it was his serious girlfriend of a year plus. Turns out he'd broken up with his girlfriend a few months earlier, hence being on Tinder, and hence meeting Rose.

I genuinely threw this down and didn't think much about it but people have really latched onto the photo point, I almost regret including it. The logistics and expense was much more important to me in reality. Tbh, it was mostly just that we wanted to have our family & friends with us for the day, not the guy or girl someone had taken up with for six weeks or whatever... ofc married couples can divorce and so on, but they were more likely to be close to us than New Boyfriend #6, you know?  The photos were a minor point, of course long term couples can divorce and so on, but we wanted to be surrounded by people we knew who were members of our family or friend groups rather than the girl or guy someone was dating for six weeks at the time.

Thank you all who were polite and helpful 


Okay alittle background information here, I got a dog for my birthday about a year ago, the dog was very friendly and well behaved and we never had any issues with him what so ever. But my husband decided he wanted his own dog so he went and got a puppy just a few days before our daughter was born (last year). I told my husband it was fine for him to get his dog as long as he would be the one to train it and clean up after it because 1) I had a c section 2) my hands are full looking after our daughter and 3) I do all the house work. Anyway it's been a year now and the dog is STILL NOT TRAINED! I mean this dog poops in the house, destroys the garbage and nips at me all the time! I've just had enough. And now we are expecting our second child so I know I can not keep being responsible for this dog so I gave my husband three options, 1) Rehome the dog. 2) tie her outside or 3)clean up after her for now on... He chose to tie her out but got extremely upset with me and said it's not fair I get to keep my dog inside and his has to be tied outside. I asked my family about it and they think I am in the right but his friends think I'm not being fair.

Edit: I just want to add in that he says my dog is my responsibility and therefore his is his responsibility as well but I have been the one cleaning up after her, disciplining her and taking care of her. I just don't have the time with another baby on the way to train her and we can't afford to pay for professional training. Also she has a heated shed that I turned into her home not just tied in the lawn (I realized that should be mentioned) oh and she is a German Shepherd Collie mix with very thick fur but we live in a colder climate

Edit 2. My husband doesn't want to rehome her and I would hate to do something like that behind his back. I have always believed keeping a dog outside is wrong but I honestly am out of options. She will still be walked and brought with us when we go places but she is just not coming around me and my kids because I can not trust her and I can't have her destroying my house and costing me thousands.",2020-11-27 14:11:53,56,19,0.85,2,0,13,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To one side of my house is the green space. It’s pretty much a wide open field with a swing set where the children in the block can go to play, or sometimes the neighbors have meetups there. On the other side, my neighbors and their 5 children, ages 4-11.

These children are very poorly behaved. They also throw trash all over their yard, our yard, and the green space, as well as leaving their toys all over. I pick trash  and toys out of my yard almost every day as well as cleaning up the green space because 1 it bothers me to look at and 2 I want our other neighbors to be able to enjoy the space. Often, when I come home from work, I have to get out of my car and pull scateboards, bikes, or scooters out of my driveway so I can pull in. Also, their parents put their 3 dumpsters out in front of my property and just leave it there for days after trash pickup, if they bother to bring them in at all. 

I have spoken to the children and to their parents about the toys and trash. When that didn’t work, I contacted the HOA about it who said they’d “reach out to them” but nothing really changed. I have started to, instead of returning the toys, simply throw them away. As far as I’m concerned, these things become litter when they are left out, especially on my own property. And I am hoping that they will stop leaving their things out if they realize that they disappear if they leave them laying around. 

I feel slightly guilty because it’s their parents paying for these things and it’s wasteful, but at the same time, I feel justified in doing so. Also their mom doesn’t work, she stays at home with them, sees the messes outside, and doesn’t do anything about it. 

In the past week I’ve thrown away at around a dozen toys (anything from McDonald’s toys, to electronic toys that make noise, to a baseball bat, baseballs, and a helmet), two thermos cups, a pair of socks, a pair of shoes, and a pair of scissors as well as untold amount of snack wrappers and scraps of paper and plastic.

101,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jxpwrp/aita_for_shaming_dating_single_moms/,AITA for “shaming dating single moms”?,"Provocative title but it’s not what it looks like. I admit I might be the AH here but I’m curious what other people think. 

I (27) have 3 older siblings. The oldest being Eliott (32M) who is dating Lisa, mother to two boys. Elliot and I have never really gotten along. My whole family had dinner Sunday night and my new gf came up, she was not there, neither was elliots gf. Elliot asked at dinner how I met my gf and I said the truth about how we met on an app, which honestly is super common these days. 

He responded something like “I would never date someone I met on the internet. That seems desperate and weird to me”. I responded “to each their own. I would never date someone with kids from another man”. He huffed and puffed and got all mad, which I can’t really blame him for but I only said it out of response to his comment. 

One of my brothers had to excuse himself because he kept laughing but later said it was a little uncalled for. My sister said my comment was a little rude but she gets it because Elliot can be an even bigger asshole and he technically started it. My dads sentiments are about the same as my sisters while my mom is just trying to get us both to apologize and hasn’t taken a side. I love my mom and kind of regretted my comeback because I’m usually better than that, so I agreed and apologized to Elliot but he’s not over it and is still pissed at me and hasn’t apologized for his initial comments. 

He says I’m way worse because I was “shaming single moms”. This isn’t the case it was just a quick witted comeback but I can admit it wasn’t especially nice.


Edit: I have literally nothing against single moms and didn’t think they don’t deserve love like some people are suggesting. It was literally just a quick witted comeback.",2020-11-20 14:25:08,72,24,0.77,2,2,16,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We've had a few ups and downs but all told I think we are a pretty strong couple. In fact, we've even decided to live together.

However, I have a problem with one of her decisions which lead to this fight. I had been renting half of a side by side duplex from an older couple. When I moved in a few years ago I paid a $700 damage deposit. The husband and wife took me through the unit and when we got to the bathroom for some reason the wife made a special point about how she'd hung a new shower curtain in there. Her shower curtain was ugly, but I made note of it.

After I moved in I took down her shower curtain and replaced it with one more my style. However I folded the one that belonged to the owners and placed it on the top shelf of a cupboard in the bathroom.

Just a few months later I met my current girlfriend. We fell in love pretty quickly and she ""unofficially"" began to live with me and moved many of her possessions into my half of the duplex. For some reason she became utterly fixated on the shower curtain in the bathroom cupboard and began to insist that it was taking up ""too much room."" When she asked why I was keeping an ""old, ugly"" shower curtain around I told her that it was supplied with the area when I had rented it. She kept insisting that I didn't need to keep it around and kept asking me to throw it away. She wouldn't do it herself, but she kept bugging me to do it. I told her that the shower curtain belonged to the landlady and that I really didn't have a right to toss it, but she kept insisting that she wouldn't care. Finally I relented, just to make the stupid conversation go away.

Anyway, our relationship progressed and we ended up buying a home together. As I (we) were moving out I was going through the unit with my old landlords the woman noticed that her shower curtain was gone and I was honest with her; I told her that my girlfriend had for some strange reason insisted that I throw it out. She ended up deducting me $15 from my damage deposit.  I was pretty annoyed at this; not at her, but at my girlfriend because she wouldn't listen to me and wouldn't drop the shower curtain thing. I told my girlfriend that she owed me $15 for making me throw the shower curtain away. She insisted that she didn't ""make"" me do anything, but I kind of feel as if she did. But I refused to drop the issue until she gave me a ten and a five, So am I the asshole? I think I may be for making such a big issue of it, but it really annoys me that she wouldn't listen to me.",2020-11-24 12:09:42,32,56,0.89,3,0,4,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
103,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/izsk8d/aita_for_leaving_a_date_at_a_restaurant/,AITA For leaving a date at a restaurant,"I am 28M and single. Now that covid has settled down a bit in my area, I have cautiously started dating again. I use dating apps mostly and don't really meet girls until we've talked for a week or two.  Recently I met up with a girl I've been talking with for a couple weeks and we had coffee. I thought we really hit it off so we set up a date a couple nights later for drinks. That went really well too so we set up a third date for dinner. 

We decided on a fairly casual restaurant where we could sit outside and that wasn't too pricey. I arrived at the restaurant first and waited for her before getting a table. When we sit down she mentions that she forgot her wallet and asked if it was ok if I paid. We had paid for ourselves on our previous dates, but I didn't really think anything of it and agreed. It's not like the place was very expensive anyway.

The first red flag was when she immediately started being rude to the waitress. We hadn't even been sitting for 3 minutes and she made a comment about it ""taking long enough"" when the waitress came to offer us water and get a drink order. I honestly thought she was making a joke in poor taste because she hadn't behaved like this on our previous dates. She ordered a gin and tonic and when it arrived she took a sip and literally refused to believe it was a gin and tonic. I asked to take a sip and it was definitely a gin and tonic. She then accused the waitress of giving her the wrong drink to which the waitress apologized and offered to bring a new one.

I honestly wouldn't be surprised if the waitress just brought back the exact same drink, but the second one was perfect according to my date. She then insisted on having an appetizer because she was starving. Ok, I like apps, lets do this. But then she ordered the most expensive entree on the menu and a little lightbulb went off in my head. She ate half her entree and then decided that it wasn't good and asked for a new one. At this point I had enough and decided I needed to do something. I excused myself to the bathroom, found our waitress, explained that this girl sucked and I was leaving but wanted to pay my half of the bill. I also told her that if she told my date that she has no idea where I went, that I would give her an extra $20 in addition to the tip. 

It took about 20-minutes before my phone started blowing up. Text messages flowed in asking where I was, then when reality sunk in for her, she started asking how she was supposed to pay for her meal with no money. I blocked her after I got home and told the story to my roommate. She agrees the girl sucked but thinks I was a jerk for leaving like I did.",2020-09-25 21:34:17,309,1473,0.94,13,0,33,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He also started puberty and had been really really emotional. He has mood swings and will often be snappy, which cause my wife to yell at him. I try and tell her that he’s just going through a tough time and can’t help it, but she doesn’t listen. The other night, they got in a big fight. They were screaming at each other over something stupid. I intervened and tried to call it down, but just escalated it. 

It ended up with my son going to his room and staying there until after we went to bed. Some time around 2am, he came into our room like a toddler. He said he was sorry and is just confused. He crawled into bed in between us, but my wife got on to him. She told him he should’ve been better earlier, and couldn’t sleep with us. This upset him even more and he started to leave, but I stopped him. I let him sleep on my side of the bed, as soon as he laid down, he started crying and saying he was sorry. I told him that I’m not mad and everything will be okay. 

The next morning, I talked to my wife about what happened. She said she’s still mad at him for yelling and won’t accept his apology because, “if he was sorry, he wouldn’t have done it.” I was pissed and told her he was just going through a tough time and was confused. I told her she was being a bitch and left for work.

For getting angry and flighting with my husband over something “so petty”,"I 26f and my husband 28m got new phones at the being of the year iPhones 11. When I got my iPhone I got my neon sharpies out and coloured in my phone charger the socket and cord, I also coloured in my headphones that come with it so I knew which on was mine and which is my husband. Now my husband is so bad at losing and breaking things. He also takes some thing of mine sometimes without asking. 

So about a month ago I go into the bedroom to put my phone on charge it’s not there, I ask him where my phone charger is I think (can’t fully remember) he said he took it to work. I got annoyed at him cause again he took it without asking. He said I could use his charger until he brings mine back ok cool. I can work with that.

Now last few weeks his charger not working correctly it works but you have to make sure it put in correctly on the right angle. So I asked for my charger back he say he doesn’t know where it is...so I’ve been using this dodgy charger for a few weeks now. Now I asked my lovely husband (we share bank accounts) if I could buy a new iPad. I had was still deciding if I should or not, when he said he bought one for me yay! (Again remember we share bank accounts) my iPad gets here a few days ago I was going to put the charger that came with it near my computer so I had a charger there and keep using the dodgy one in the bedroom. Anyway I’m heading to bed I walk in an he looks suspicious... I know my husband. I leave go check the iPad box the charger missing..

I have a temper I know. I blow up at him yelling at him he better not be thinking he is using that charger it my charger and no way in hell he is using it, he said it’s  only for one night I said you may think that but it never is you steal everything, I yell saying where my old charger he said I have it. It’s not because mine coloured in! I also yelled that you stole my headphone (I don’t mind that because I don’t use them but took them again without asking) you stole my charger and now you are stealing my charger again. He gets all pissy with me and goes we are not talking about this I’m only using it for tonight. He goes to sleep.

He work early comes home for lunch and ask if I’m ready to apologise for the way I spoke to him last night over something so petty and doesn’t understand why we even flighting about this.

So I a yell (if I’m angry I yell) I am so very that you stole my headphones, charger and now want to steal my new charger again.

He then says well I bought the iPad there for it’s mine.(money comes out of OUR bank account)

107,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/joj6je/aita_for_taking_advantage_of_a_menu_mistake/,AITA for taking advantage of a menu mistake?,"Hi guys, 
I wanted to get your opinions on this one. It's no biggie, just i kept thinking about it and wanted to see what you all think. 

So there's this restaurant that sells sandwiches and pizza etc. In the sandwiches section, there are different sandwiches types along with their respective prices. 

They are set in an ""cheapest to most expensive"" order (or at least supposedly)

So I go there, i find that sandwich D s between C and E, and less expensive than both of them.

 Obviously, a menu mistake, but i thought i would take advantage of it. So I got that sandwich (supposedly 4$) he charged (5.5$). 

So I said on the menu its written 4 so you're supposed to charge 4, he said that they were planning to change it, so i said that isn't my fault, as a customer i pay what's written on the menu. 
So he gave me my 1.5$. 


So order comes, and it's not what i ordered (smth cheaper) and I only found out halfway through (wasn't focusing on the food but rather the company i had) and i thought its rude  to tell them that it wasnt it when i was already halfway through with it, so i ate the rest. 


I was back today to get the order that i initially wanted, menu still hasn't changed so i ordered it again. He charged 5.5$ again, wr had the same discussion, so he apparently recognized me and said arent you the one who came like 3 days ago and i said that that was me.


He then nodded sarcastically and said again to which i said it's my right to pay what's written on the menu. 
He gave me back my 1.5$.

I was wondering, do you think i was an asshole ?

Edit: I'm not from the US, no tips or taxes or anything are added to the prices on menus

Edit 2: since someone mentioned it, the man at the registry did contact a superior to let them know that the difference in the registry isn't due to theft or smth",2020-11-05 13:57:59,79,127,0.91,12,0,14,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As university life goes, people want to experiment with their sexuality and so did Kayla. At the time I kind of had a thing for Kayla so I was happy to be her ""Experiment buddy"", we were in a relationship for two months before Kayla decided that dating girls wasn't her thing and she was straight.

I was ok with it, I preferred having Kayla as my best friend anyways so it wasn't some major dramatic break-up that broke our friendship. We were still besties and Kayla invited me over to her parents house. I met ""Kyle"", Kayla's older brother. As soon as we started getting close I fell hard and I mean HARD. Kayla was cool with our relationship and it wasn't like a ""dating my sibling's ex"" thing because Kayla and I didn't really see the relationship we had as an actual ""romantic relationship"".

So me and Kyla started dating and can I tell you, he's the absolute love of my life and we got engaged a few months ago(woo!). I was on cloud nine, I love him so much and as an added bonus Kayla just went from my best friend to my sister. However I wouldn't be making this post if something didn't happen. Kayla's family was a little skeptical when me as me an Kayla were pretty open about the fact that we did date. They were worried it would affect their relationship, so the concern was real. Then they realized that there was no hard feelings at all and everything was chill on that side.

When we announced our engagement to my family, everyone was ecstatic and we had a celebratory dinner. My sister said right in the middle of dinner how nice it is that I got to have a sibling trial run before going for the deal. I just kind of sat there in disbelief that she said that and Kyle told her off in a polite way. She then proceeds to double down and asks how nice it must have been ""to fuck around in the same family"" and I told her that the reason she doesn't have a sex life is being she's too busy caring about her other's and she needs to stop being jealous I got the best of both worlds. Kyle and most of the family(including grandma) started laughing at her, and she left the table.

Later she pulled me aside and told me I was the asshole for talking about our ""private conversations"" with the family like that( she texted me when she was drunk that she doesn't have a sex life). My mom also pulled me aside and told me I was the asshole for letting Kyle laugh at my sister like that and ""that's going to start them off on a bad relationship"".Kyle thinks It was hilarious but there's an obvious bias right there, my dad laughed too but has since said that mom is right, so AITA?",2020-10-11 17:07:29,129,1016,0.9,7,0,27,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She isn’t even my daughter and my ex won’t contribute either.,"Long story short, my daughter turned out to not be my daughter. My ex wife and I divorced and have been so for 5 years.

My “daughter” turned 19 five months ago and I haven’t had contact with either her or her mother, despite my ex wife trying to insist. 

I get a call last week that my daughter suddenly had a stroke.  I don’t know how this could have happened at such a young age- some doctors think it’s her birth control others think it is a multitude of other reasons.

Anyway, my ex wife’s mother calls and said that 
she has expressive aphasia, incontinence, and is unable to walk. 

She goes on this long speel about how the therapy her grandchild is going to need is extensive and expensive, and that we both need to step up.

However, my ex wife and our “ daughter” have always hated each other. 

My ex wife calls and said that our daughter is the “ cunt that ruined our marriage” and that she “ sure as hell wasn’t going to subsidize her treatment.”

She tells me that I need to step up. However, as she made sure of, this isn’t my kid and I think it’s enough that I had to pay child support for years on end for a child that wasn’t mine.

My ex’s mother calls yesterday and asks why it was taking so long to get back to her, and I told her that if she wanted to preach about “ stepping up” so much, she could get another mortgage on her house and pay for her granddaughter’s treatment because I wasn’t going to be burdened with somebody else’s mistake anymore.

Now it’s been a day and the state of affairs is that 1. my ex wife refuses to pay 2. Her mother says that what she gets in retirement is barely enough for herself to survive on.

However, both are calling me the asshole for not “ stepping up.” So am I the asshole? Because I think it is them that are being selfish once again and it’s almost as if my ex wife thinks that putting her own daughter down will make me feel affection towards her again- a dumb and self centered thought.

We ate and drank like we were still 20 up until we were in our 40s, and our doctors told us that we needed to change our habits now or we could expect nothing good to come later on in life.

I took it extremely seriously. I started changing my diet, trying to go on walks or jogs when I could. Things like that. I always bothered my wife about trying to change our lifestyles, but shes one of those people who need something to happen in order for change.

She would try from time to time to get better, but always fell short or made excuses as to why she couldnt do it.

Well, something eventually did happen. It turns out my wife has some sort of plaque build up in her bones (..? Not really sure about what it is, just what may happen), and she may have diabetes or Osteoporosis or both, and now it's just been test after test hoping that it isnt as bad as we think it is. She is the first in her family to have any sort of medical conditions like this.

It's the winter time now, and she wants to go on walks everyday; once in the morning at like 6AM, and once during the night at 6PM, and she gets mad when I dont want to, or when I dont feel like it.

Its getting too damn cold to go outside, theres like a foot of snow outside that we have to walk through which I just dont really want to do daily.

She has thrown out all the junk food from our house, which is a complete waste because I like to enjoy  snacking some times, but I do understand the temptations, so Im not so upset about that.

Today she got upset that I didnt want to go for a walk with her, and actually had the audacity to say that ive been so unsupportive of her during a time when she really needs me, and cant believe how I cant even spend 30 mins walking with her everyday.

I got really upset, I told her Ive been telling her for years that she needed to change, and that I have always supported her, I dont need to be doing what shes doing at all, Im completely fine, and maybe if she just listened to me before we wouldnt have to worry about this. I do want to walk with her, but its just too much for me now in my old ass age.

My daughter made me feel really bad about the whole thing. My wife called her and explained the entire situation, and she says that if I ""truly loved her"" then it shouldnt be about me saying ""I told you so"" but rather ""lets work on this together"".

In this department we were more like a big family than just colleagues as we are essential workers(make a guess, not telling) and it was everyone's company that kept us going through the busy nights, especially in times like this. 


I was the youngest and newest then, so the guys were very helpful and patient with me. One big guy ""Tom"" was very physically affectionate and he loves to pat, hug, mock wrestle, squeeze cheeks and lightly slap the younger staffs on the back, including me.


I don't mind Tom treating me like the guys, in fact I think that he just a sweet cuddly bear, and sometimes I squeeze him back too. I never felt uncomfortable among the guys and I know they are all decent people.


About a week ago we had one additional staff, another lady ""Amy""(21). As you may have guessed from the title now, Amy got mad when Tom attempted to hug her and when Tom realized that, he quickly apologized and mentioned that he thought she wouldn't mind because I didn't. Amy said something like this.


""Just because dirty sluts love getting touched by guys doesn't mean all women do!"" 


Obviously I took it as an insult, I haven't done anything to Amy and she straight up said that in front of all the guys. I was tired and I didn't want to start a fight so I pretended I didn't hear it, but Amy kept yelling at Tom as he apologized profusely with a few other guys trying to calm her down.


Later on Amy approached me and told me that she needed my help to report Tom for harassment, and she got Kat backing her up. Still tired and in a bad mood, I replied sarcastically ""Yeah, I shall report too, you for your foul language, and the guys will back me up because they heard what you called me.""


Amy got really upset at me because she assumed that all women should stand up to the men, but she's got nerve wanting my help reporting my friend after insulting me out of nowhere. Kat told us to sort it out before leaving because she feels that she is too busy for drama and Amy got angrier because now she has nobody to back her up, and she blames it on me.


Just to be clear, I am not reporting anybody, too tired for that shit. Tom and Amy can sort it out between themselves and I am not going to bother with either of them. Go on.


Info: After reading some comments there are some common misconceptions that I would like to clarify.


1. No, Tom does not touch butts and breasts, if he does forget about Amy don't you think I would have long did something about it?? Common sense people. Tom is like a brother or uncle to us younger staffs. 


2. We do work professionally but because our job requires us to work away from home, lots of communication and moving around, especially when we work overnights it us common for us to talk casually and joke/mess around to some extent so that we can stay alert. This us more than common office like environment so despite being tiring we a have god relationships with each other.


3. Kat is one of the seniors in the department, so naturally Tom does not mess with her, but she knows about Tom and as as I have no complaints she doesn't care what he does. When Amy got offended, Kat is also one of the first to reach her side and told Tom off. I suppose Amy then convinced her to help her to report Tom for harassment but since she changed her mind, Amy is alone in this now.


4. I don't mean to justify Tom's actions. He made a wrong assumption and that's on him. However, since Amy had be as nice as to imply me for being a ""dirty slut"" a, I see no reason helping her.
Had she also apologized to me we could have worked it out with Tom in a civilized manner without resorting to complaining to the upper management. But now, I don't want anything to do with the case between Amy and Tom, they are able adults and pretty sure they could work it out themselves.",2020-08-11 11:57:38,1333,5906,0.94,9,0,34,93,,,,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,

So, We were having a family get together, over the course of 3 nights, and me(26F) and my sister(27F) were swapping the roles of babysitting whilst the other got some rest. Now, my nephew(4) and my son(4) were both talking about wolves, because they saw a tv show about a wolf pack. I think it was a documentary or something. They asked me about wolf packs and how the whole Alpha Beta thing worked. 

I tried to explain that wolf packs were one big family, and that the Alphas are the strongest from each gender. This is when nephew piped up and said ""oh, so is Mommy the alpha of our pack?"". I found it cute that he was trying to make us like a wolf pack, but, without thinking, said that ""no, Sis isn't the alpha"". And when Nephew asked who the alpha was, I said I was the alpha, once again, without really thinking. ""But you said the Alpha's the strongest? Mommy's stronger than you"" 

I said that I was stronger than my Sis. Now, here's where my son started making fun of nephew and said ""my mom's stronger than yours"" I didn't realise it at the time, but nephew is on the spectrum, and takes so many things personally, and get's really competitive about everything, similar to my sis. 

My sis came up to me later, and asked why I was insulting her earlier. I said I wasn't but she said that I was openly claiming I was better than her. I said only the truth, and that I was stronger, but Sis says that son won't stop mocking nephew, even though I told him to stop. 

So, my Sis's solution, was to challenge me to an arm-wrestling match in front of the kids. Now, I'm pretty sure she thought she was stronger than me, so without thinking just challenged me, thinking that it would put my son in his place. I beat her easily, and my nephew immediately started bawling. My mom came to later and told me that I should have just taken the loss, but how was I supposed to know what to do, Sis never told me anything. Sis is now busy consoling Nephew, and doesn't want to speak to me. She told me quietly that I had embarrassed and humiliated her in front of her own kid.

My ex-wife and I divorced mostly amicably and co-parent.

I'm now remarried and the topic of children has come up. I'd love to have another child. I'll admit my wife is a little clinical and wanted to know my ex-wife's medical history to see at a glance if it was ""her fault"" my daughter has her condition. My wife wants to have children but wanted to know if we should expect this condition to come up again and what difficulties we may face.

I thought this was a fairly innocuous question so I explained that this condition was shared with her brother, uncle, and grandmother. I don't think this condition was even a discovered thing going further. I don't like to think of it as ""it's this person's fault"" but I think everyone is in agreement this condition runs in her family, not mine, so it is ""her fault"" if you wanted to frame it like that. At no point did I frame it like this except in this thread.

I thought about it some more and I think maybe I was the asshole for disclosing this part of my ex-wife's and her family's medical history. Was I the asshole? Is it even my current wife's business?",2020-11-12 16:16:39,76,34,0.81,14,9,8,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, since I have been off work due to the COVID-19 pandemic I have had a lot of time at home to myself, especially with my son being back at school now and I have taken to cleaning the entire house and I have made it my routine to clean the house once a week.

Usually, I don't touch my sons room as to not invade his privacy, but I thought I'd be doing him a favour if I cleaned it for him so he didn't need to when he got home, but I was extremely alarmed when I found a small bag of weed behind his drawer.

Personally, I've only ever drank and I've always been heavily against all types of drugs, so seeing what in my head is the start of my son taking a route that too many other have taken and ruined themselves because of obviously made me furious.

I texted his mother and told her about what had happened and she said she'd leave work early but didn't seem to put much effort into her texts at all and honestly didn't seem too bothered at all, but I thought that it was just because of her mannerisms while texting.

Once my son got home, we sat him down and showed him the bag and he started shouting at me telling me I shouldn't have been in his room to which my wife agreed and said I was invading his privacy. Now, I fully believe in privacy, but it was out of pure kindness I'd even went into his room and I was mostly annoyed at him as in Northern Ireland where we live, weed is completely illegal.

After agreeing about his privacy, my wife started saying that weed isn't even that bad and that he's 17 and can do what he wants, this infuriated me and I shouted at her and called her heartless for not even caring that her son was doing illegal drugs and ruining his brain, to which she told me to fuck off and stormed out of the room.

I have punished my son and took the weed but my wife still isn't happy and is being really bitchy towards me, which I find unbelievably stupid as this is over our son doing things he could be locked up for. Reddit, does my wife have a point? He is 17 and I suppose it's better than him doing cocaine or MDMA but is it not our job to protect him from that sort of lifestyle as parents?

I am second in command at the store I work at. We just hired someone who is 28F as a part time worker. Usually we joke around with the staff, have fun, and mess with eachother it’s an overall chill environment. But I think this lady is taking it too far. This 28 year old is acting really strange and it makes me uncomfortable. Today while I was training her, my boss was on break ( he is THE manager, first in command) and she kept talking about her ex boyfriend who apparently abused her and going into detail about what he did to her. I never asked her for this information. It makes me uncomfortable because I’m not friends with employees like that, so I don’t really care or want to know their personal life details. It makes me feel awkward, and I grew up in an abusive household so it’s not something I enjoy thinking about. She also asked me if I’m on birth control, talked about periods, and kept trying to have some kind of “girl talk” but I’m not that kind of person and I don’t want to be. It was just really weird that she would speak to me like this given that I am her boss, and also the age difference between us. Idk how to handle someone who overshares constantly, and I probably won’t confront her directly, but I might tell my boss to speak to her about it. Would that make me an asshole? I wouldn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings or make them feel like their problems aren’t important. It sounds like she is in desperate need for a friend who is also a woman, but I can’t be her friend like that, not with a 28 year old.

Edit: I think everyone is right in that I need to boss up and confront her. But I would also like to add that although I am a higher up than her, I have never had any type of training for handling work conflicts like this. But my Manager has had that type of training. Usually if people are posing problems, or are being fired, my manager handles that. My job does not entail that I handle conflicts like this. I wish I could say what store, and what my position is formally called, but I don’t want to say where I work lol. Also, people have said I may be unqualified for this position, but I have held this position for over a year now and have done very well. I just wanted people to know that it’s not really in my job responsibilities to be the one who handles conflict.

Before I came along, we had three kids (the youngest is now 17) and three ex-wives. 

Recently we were talking about a barbecue that we have in the backyard that we don't use because I originally bought it for the partner I had before him. He said that he doesn't feel comfortable using another man's bbq. In the past, as we've both been through other relationships, we decided that wherever possible, we would get new things that don't have the connotations of other people associated with them. 

So with that idea in mind, I'm thinking of asking him if we can replace his 27-year-old fake Christmas tree that has always been used while all his kids were growing up. I'm not saying that he'd have to get rid of the decorations that the kids made over the years, so he would still have items with sentimental values, but I'd like something that hasn't been associated with his ex-wives and that would give us a fresh start for creating family traditions together.

My girlfriend and I have been together for 6 years now. We have a 15 month old together, and I’m very happy and content with my life that we’ve created together.

My parents, especially my mom, don’t like my girlfriend. They’ve never said, “I don’t like your girlfriend.” but they’ve never respected her. She would always be on the receiving end of their backhanded compliments and passive-aggressiveness.
Obviously, I couldn’t tolerate that shit and I started to distance myself from them. 

When we announced our pregnancy, my mom’s first reaction was to blame my girlfriend for getting pregnant before marriage (I’m not going to explain how stupid that sounds.) and to get mad at my girlfriend for choosing to continue her education while expectant and caring for a child. (she’s currently getting her masters degree) I told my mom several times to shut up.

My girlfriend was still working out through most of her pregnancy, and very quickly fell back into that routine after she gave birth. It was completely her decision, she’s happy working out and she looks great either way so who was I to stop her. 

My mom caught wind of this through a family friend, and essentially shamed her for it through a series of badly written text messages. I had to put a stop to it, and my mom just kept going. We eventually stopped responding to my mom’s texts for a while.

My parents came to stay with me because my mom’s best friend, who was living with her, passed away. I was very hesitant to let my parents come over, but my girlfriend convinced me to take them and let her grieve properly. I did tell them that I wouldn’t hesitate to kick them out if they insulted my girlfriend. They’re staying with us for a week.

My parents and my girlfriend managed to stay o it of each other’s hair. My mom actually gave my girlfriend a genuine compliment about her food (I know, it’s the bare minimum, but I think it took everyone aback) and my dad didn’t complain about anything.

Good things only last so long.

My girlfriend made a one-piece swimsuit and a bikini from scratch. She was really proud of herself and wanted to take pictures of herself in her bikini in our backyard, around/in the pool. It was all in good fun, she thought she looked nice and wanted to see her hard work. The “photoshoot” lasted almost 10 minutes, and my girlfriend immediately wore a robe when we were finished.

I’m assuming my mom was watching us; because her first thought was to ask my girlfriend why she was so eager to reveal her body. 

Then she went on to basically call my girlfriend a slut for posting “revealing photos on her Instagram” When my girlfriend took offense to that statement, and I got mad at her for being rude. My dad chimed in claiming that she could have waited until later to avoid being too distracting.

My girlfriend began to wear looser clothing around my parents because she was starting to see their point of view.

They’re out of my house now and I’m still pissed, but everyone thinks I’m overreacting,

EDIT: I did kick them out. However, I did give them a day to move out though so that they could find a hotel or somewhere else to stay - hence the my girlfriend started to wear looser clothing around my parents.",2020-09-09 21:46:21,315,3919,0.96,10,0,96,15,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
120,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jqd7z4/aita_for_expecting_dogs_to_listen_and_obey/,AITA for expecting Dogs to listen and obey?,"This happened very recently and I am getting confused. I live next to my parents, our Properties touch so, and we see each other often. Both Properties are quite open and border onto the street, but we live in a village, so very few cars, mostly people on walks.

Today was the second time a dog ran onto our property to chase my cat. My Cat is an outside cat, but he doesn't move around much. When we are sitting outside like today, he wanders around us and will sit somewhere near. Last time, he was sitting on the grass when a little dog came rushing onto our Ground. My cat fled under one of our cars. This time he was sitting close to the street and rushed behind the house when a larger Dog from the house behind ours chased after him. Of course, I jumped up and rand after them, not touching the dog. My brother though was faster than me and took the dog by the collar to get him away. My Cat was fine.

The thing why I am asking here is the following: both times the owners of the Dogs stood nearby, just calling their animal and it obviously didn't listen. It took both a while to make a move to go after their Dogs and get them back. And today the woman even yelled at my brother to never touch a foreign animal, because ""People don't touch other peoples dogs."" To that my Father commented that dogs should not run onto other Peoples Property, and she lost her mind. She was screaming about how our cat would come onto her balcony, and we should keep him inside and how her dog is harmless and so on.

Thing is, both times the owners acted like nothing was wrong. Like ""of course they will run after a cat"". Like it's completely normal for Dogs to do this sort of things. Now, I never had a dog. I don't know much about dogs. I expected Dogs to come if their owner call them, no matter the circumstances and if not to be on a leash at least where there a houses and people. Or at the very least for people to be apologetic. If my Dog ran onto other ppls Garden and chasing their animals, I would be beyond myself with embarrassment. Am I expecting too much? Is there really nothing they could do, is this normal? AITH here for being mad at the owners, should I apologize for being somewhat rude today? The fact that both people reacted similarly confident about being in the right here makes me questing myself. Are there people who own dogs who can bring some light into this?

Also: I live in Germany, there is no such thing as ""stand your ground"". And my cat is fine. And the dog today wasn't aggressive, I think he really was just curious. I was just really shaken about the whole thing and didn't expect her to be this mad and deflective.

Edit/Update: Thank all of you for commenting and most importantly, giving me another view and a reason to rethink. I wrote the Post whilst still being under a lot of stress and worry for my cat being hurt or hurting the Dog. I will read up on Dogs and on what to expect from them and talk to a view dog owners we have around to which we have a friendly relationship.  

Onto my neighbor: I will talk to her when I see her next. I'm going to apologize again for my Cat being on my balcony and offer to get her one of the air cat repelled thingys for her to set up if she wants. We will also have the entire property, as well as my parents fenced in next year, as soon as possible. But I will also be adamant about her apologizing. My Cat was fine, her Dog was not aggressive, but still it chased my cat, and she stood on the road just calling, instead of getting him back. I want an apology for her negligence and slow reaction. I will also ask her to keep the dog leashed just for the way down her driveway and until past our House, which is about 8 Meters, I think that is a reasonable request.",2020-11-08 15:11:22,99,40,0.82,1,0,13,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
121,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/isi0go/aita_for_withdrawing_my_daughters_college_tuition/,Aita for withdrawing my daughter’s college tuition?,"I’m father to a son (15) and a daughter (18). While we can afford basic living expenses and the occasional vacation, we are by no means rich. My daughter only has a minimum wage job, and my wife is a stay-at-home mom, so I’m the family’s main source of income. 

Last year, when my daughter was applying to colleges, we came to the agreement that she would enroll in a community college. The universities she wanted to attend were expensive, and I felt it wasn’t worth it because 1: I have two children to consider, and 2: she wanted to major in classical music performance, and would likely end up switching majors anyway due to poor job prospects.

Later, I found out she’d applied to several universities without our knowledge and was accepted to one. I was a bit hurt that she went behind my back and spent $200 of her hard-earned money on application fees instead of using them to help our family’s financial situation. But in the end I agreed to pay 75% of her tuition, given that she switched to a more useful major. 
 
My daughter ended up attending college via zoom due to the pandemic. Last week I found an amazon package of music books addressed to her, which I thought was suspicious because her new major didn’t require music classes. I confronted her about it and she confessed that she had never actually switched majors. She had been lying to me the whole summer. 

I was extremely hurt, as she was essentially scamming me out of money by going back on our deal and lying about her major. She had already betrayed my trust by wasting money applying to colleges she didn’t need, then again by tricking me into paying 75% of her tuition. I told her I was withdrawing my share of the tuition and that she could pay with her own money if she wanted to attend this university. She started crying that she couldn’t afford it on a minimum wage job and didn’t want to go into debt from student loans. She said her chosen school’s music program was better than the community college’s and she didn’t want to major in any other field. I told her she should’ve thought of all that before lying and disrespecting me like she did.

She started screaming terrible names at me and accused me of favoritism, complaining about how I was willing to buy a new computer for my son but not pay for her college education. I explained that 1: it was because my son had never betrayed my trust,  2: he needed his own computer because he intended to major in software engineering, and 3: it’s not like I never bought her anything. I payed for her clothes, extracurriculars, the band instrument she’s currently trying to major in. I gave her everything and she’s been nothing but ungrateful. 

My wife sided with my daughter and said I was being unreasonable. I just said that as our household’s primary source of income, I have every right to decide what to do with my money. I’d be happy to forgive and support her if she chooses a more realistic major or transfers to a less expensive school.

Clarification edit: my wife has her personal reasons for not being able to work, which I don’t want to state here because they’ll make our family very identifiable to the people who already know us. But her being a stay-at-home mom is very much justified and I don’t appreciate people attacking her for it.

Edit: I wasn’t upset with my daughter spending $200 on application fees because I desperately needed the money, I was hurt because she did it behind my back while knowing that I’d have difficulty affording any of the colleges she applied to. She placed me in a difficult situation and jeopardized her brother’s future purely on a whim. Not only that, she’s also an adult living in my house without paying rent. We had a deal that she’d pay whatever amount she was comfortable with every month; it’s more of a symbolic gesture than anything. It was such a shock for me to learn that after all we had talked about, she still prioritized a fantasy over her real family.

——————

Update: after reading through the comments, I’ve realized that my approach with the whole “symbolic rent” idea has caused a lot of problems. I’ve spoken to my daughter and set a proper rent. It’s very low, as I see no point putting her into unnecessary debt, but at least now there’s no more confusion over what she’s expected to contribute as an adult living under my roof. We are still working out the issue of college tuition and majors.",2020-09-14 09:58:53,599,729,0.89,108,0,34,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,

Usually we would each have our own places in a major city. We are part of a large family four kids both parents, so the house was pretty noisy growing up. The house we are staying at is empty most of the time, both of us are there about 40% of the time. Anyways my sister has an upcoming med school interview. Last night at dinner with my entire family around she requested I be quite during the interview, everyone else will be away. All good no problems there I'm generally pretty quite person in general (maybe wake up around 7-8 and make eggs take a shower that kind of quite). The house has been no louder then general conversation volume for 6 months while we have been around. So I said as much and was like sure if I'm even home (probably going to see my girlfriend). She keeps making more requests along the same lines until she then requests that I leave the house for a couple hours since me being there at all 'distracts' her and would impact her performance. The examples I was given were of during her last interview I took a shower and made eggs. I pushed back on this pretty strongly basically saying that look I get you are nervous about this but that's somewhat unreasonable. The kitchen is separated from her room by a floor and probably 60 feet, and that I could shower downstairs since that's closer to her room (if I even showered during that hour). She continued... saying that even me sleeping would impact her shes nervous about people listening to her interview. At this point this had been going on for 5 minutes and I was pretty fed up with being told that my impact from breathing during her interview was mine to address. So I said something along the lines of this is neurotic behavior and I get this important to you but its not my job to go far outside of anything reasonable to cater to that of behavior. And that you should probably go somewhere else if shower noise through a floor or walking is going to impact your performance (note we have an office with a conference room 15 minutes away that will be completely open and empty).

At this point everyone in my family freaked out on me saying how inconsiderate and thoughtless I am. How she has worked for 6 years and you can't even give up an hour of your life for this.

It was honestly pretty funny, so other guys started doing that, and my mom keeps coming up with these roasts back.

I told my mom to stop responding to them, but she said that they're being assholes and she has every right to tell them off.

I have a now 3 year old son, who was living with my mom(his grandma) for a year while I was away getting myself together. For personal reasons I will not explain why I was away for so long, but I felt I needed to better myself for my son. My mother agreed to take care of him while I was away. (I facetimed with him whenever I could)

Fast forward to last month, I come to my mothers house to pick up my son. He's happy to see me and me and my mother are talking while hes playing with his dinosaurs. He suddenly looks up at my mother and says ""Mommy, I'm thirsty"". I was obviously confused, and asked my mother if she heard him call her mom. She laughed nervously and said that he had been calling her that for awhile. She basically explained that while I was away she told him that she was his mom and to call her that.

I laughed and told her that I wasnt comfortable with that, since she wasnt the one who birthed him. I told her he should know that shes his grandmother, not his mom. She got upset and told me that he needed a mother figure while I was gone, and she was just trying to fill that role for him. She said something along the lines of ""Ive been his mother for a year now, and you cant change it"". We went back and forth until it got to the point where we started raising our voices. She spat out some insults about me being a bad mom for being away for so long and how she should be his mom cause he doesnt need a mom like me.

I simply told her that she isn't going to be seeing him anymore because I'm not comfortable with him calling her mom. We gathered his stuff and left after that. She blew up my phone for days, talked some mess to family members, anything she could to make me look/feel bad. But I refused to forgive her, especially after all that stuff she said. 

AITA?

Edit: A word

For those of you saying I abandoned him, I didnt. I was too sick to take care of him. That's all I'm going to say about that. I couldn't be the best mother to him cause of my medical issues. I wanted to be there for him. I didnt just ""dump"" him on my mother. I feel the need to explain that cause people are getting the wrong idea.

It was possible for him to visit but my mom said it would be best if he didnt see me like that cause he'd be too young to understand. And I trusted her, so I didnt allow him to visit.

No, I wasnt in a mental hospital or rehab. It was physical health reasons.

A lot of you are saying you think I was in rehab because of the way I've worded things in my post. Rather than edit out the original, I'd just like to explain that its probably not the best wording to use for this situation and I understand that now. What I meant to say was I felt I needed to be in better health for my son. ""Getting myself together"" in my head pretty much means getting better and healthier. I apologize for that.

This will probably be my last edit. My son is getting a therapist like a lot of you have recommended.

I had been watching reruns of The Fresh Prince. Believing myself to alone, I started to recite the opening theme in an imitation Indian accent, while I was cooking. I was also chopping vegetables while making “Hiyaaaa” sounds imitating Bruce Lee. The kind of stupid shit people do while alone. Unfortunately my (white) housemate had returned early as well and had been sitting in the next room listening to me.

She had always taken a disliking to me, for no reason describing me as “conniving” and warning others to be careful around me. We had a very frosty relationship. She informed me that she was going to report me for being racist to the university authorities, and that she had recorded me. I believe she was serious and I could not persuade her otherwise.

To preempt this, I reported her first to the student officer in the accommodation. I said she had developed an unhealthy obsession with me, took videos of me on a regular basis without permission, and upon requesting her to stop she had uttered a common racial trope (I can legitimately claim Jewish ethnicity). I felt I had no other choice to protect myself against her false accusations.

The matter was escalated and she denied the accusation, making the counter accusation of my kitchen performance. Fortunately her recording was was just of me making silly noises while chopping and counted against her, as was evidence of her obsession.

She ended up being forced to move to a different flat and (her choice) did not complete that year of study, returning after summer to do so. She was reprimanded while I was not. She appealed and escalated the matter but again the ruling was in my favour.

As a result, two of my other flat mates requested they be moved from the accommodation. They also repeated the claims online about me my flat mate made - that had been disproven the the university board. They genuinely believed I was the asshole here! I believe I was simply defending myself from unfair accusations. Who is the asshole here?",2020-11-27 12:38:48,41,8,0.57,5,0,2,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From when I was 9 to when I was 16, I asked for a dog every birthday and Christmas. But I was always shut down saying it was not possible. I just stopped asking after that.

I'm 10 years older than my younger siblings. I moved out a month ago to my own place after I graduated college and got a job.

I excitedly told my parents how now I can finally get the dog I wanted and I had an appointment with the shelter next week.

Then my mom goes, ""Looks like your new puppy is going to have a sister!""

I literally freaked out a little thinking my mother was having another kid.

Instead, I found out that they'd reserved a puppy with a breeder and were going to pick her up in a month.

When I tell you I lost my shit, I mean it. I went full exorcist and was screaming at them like a mad woman.

Like every resentment I had just erupted and I called them some really mean stuff. My parents and I were in tears by the end of it.

I've refused to talk to them since.

Yesterday, I got a text from my 13 year old calling me a bitch because my parents were cancelling the puppy reservation.

I then sent them a message in the family WhatsApp group saying that if their goal was to completely exclude me from the family then congratulations, they've succeeded.

I then left the group and blocked my parents.

My dad knocked on my door last night begging me to forgive them and to please give them a chance to talk.

I refused to let him in.

It was my birthday recently, turned 16 so it was one of the big ones. In the weeks leading up, my mum was asking me ""subtly"" about things I would want. ""Your phone's a bit outdated... are you thinking of upgrading?"", ""I think your earrings are a bit old, how about some new ones?"". You know, mum stuff.

The thing is, I expressed my distaste for the above two suggestions. I said to her very plainly and very flatly, ""I like my phone. The new ones are too bulky and are essentially the same."", as well as literally LAUGHING when she suggested jewellery. ""I never wear jewellery. I only wear these sleepers (earrings) because you gave them to me when I was 2."" Instead of the gifts, I suggested she just give me money like every other year. I had my eye on this jersey I wanted and I didn't have enough money to buy it yet, so I was REALLY hoping for money. I even told my mum this.

My birthday rolls around and I'm opening gifts and, shockingly, the iPhone11 and a $300 necklace with my initial are on the table. I would be lying if I said I wasn't upset, maybe even a little mad. I explicitly denied these gifts because I knew I would dislike them and I knew that the jewellery would not be used. I said thank you, I didn't have a tantrum. I just feel like my own wishes were disregarded and, for MY BIRTHDAY, I feel like I was ignored. I said to my mum ""Didn't I say that jewellery was off the cards?"" and she rolled her eyes ""You'll grow into it! It's your 16th, you needed something special, and anyways, you need nice jewellery for later in life!"" and I felt like I knew then that she hadn't listened to me at all. They still gave me money, but it wasn't nearly enough to buy my jersey that I really wanted. When I told my mum about this, she got really upset with me, saying that ""These are really nice gifts!"" and that I should be more appreciative of what I got because they cost a lot of money and that ""Other kids don't get anything!"". She hasn't talked about it since then and it's been a little awkward when we see each other.

I feel like I'm being a spoilt brat because these gifts were REALLY EXPENSIVE and they are nice gifts, but I also feel like I wasn't listened to at all, as well as the fact that I will almost certainly never wear the necklace, I cannot stand jewellery and how it feels on me. I use the phone, but I miss my old one a lot. It felt like that, for my birthday, my mum bought gifts that she thought I SHOULD want.

It's about a 10 minute drive from my parents where I'm living until it's finished. I really enjoy doing DIY and am really looking forward to taking everything apart and working on it with my parents and we've all taken next week off to do it. 

My dad decided to also take this week off because he has a lot of holiday that he can't carry over so he needs to use it. There were some fitted wardrobes that had mirrored doors and were too big to fit in the car and my retired neighbour has a special drill to cut through glass so I asked my dad if they would be able to take those and get rid of them. That was fine and they did that yesterday.

The chimney was also blocked up in quite a shoddy way but I haven't decided if I want a real fire and so will need it unblocked which I had said to him. He pointed it out to my neighbour who said he could build a nicer block that I could leave or rip out depending so they are going back today. 

Now my dad keeps saying he will start ripping up the carpet and taking wallpaper off. I've asked him not to at least 5 times but he keeps bringing it up an hour or 2 later as if he's doing me a favour. The last time he said it I said 'it's my house, I want to do it. Why is that so hard to understand?' and he rolled his eyes and said I'll be glad that he's done it because I won't enjoy it and don't realise how much work it will be. I shouted at him that I want to work hard and I don't care and he just stormed out.

If he says it again today I'm planning on just taking the keys from him and saying I'll get a carpenter in. I feel like I'm being really ungrateful because him and our neighbour have been really helpful and are trying to help but it's my house and I want to enjoy all these things. There's also no rush because my plasterer can't come till January and I'm not planning on moving in till I'm back in the office.",2020-11-26 08:49:04,27,24,0.93,2,0,6,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's not long I know, but he lives in a little village and doesnt have a job. Hes 21. I live in the city and had a job but have been on furlough since march. I'm 19. I've spent the last 8 months creating a scrapbook and a little box of his favorite items and things that he'll like and I know he hasn't gotten me anything yet. Hasn't even thought of it. He doesnt have any money but I told him he could just get me a card or make me something personal. I'm not materialistic at all but it would be nice to get something in return for a project that took 8 months to complete. His grandma gave him £10 this week when I was next to him and he told me hes get me a card and a little something, even if it was cheap. I was more than okay with that. Half an hour later he told me hed be back in ten minutes. He spent the £10 on weed. When I called him out on it he said that hed borrow some money from his grandma or mum to get me a card but that just makes me feel like shit because it's not from him and it, and I, wasnt really his first choice. Weed was. I know technically the £10 wasnt from him either but everytime I mention going on universal credit or jobseekers he just shrugs it off. He is looking for a job, but it seems half assed.

&#x200B;

Once I was done, I went to go and clean it up, but my wife (27F)  was there and she asked ""Why are you getting cleaning supplies?."" I kind of didn't want to answer and said "" I'm just cleaning something up, don't worry about it, babe."" She pressed on though and asked what it was that I was trying to clean up, but I REALLY did not want to answer, and just tried to blow her question off and just said ""oh nah don't worry it's not a big deal just gotta wipe something up."" She kind of shrugs  and I go off and start to clean, but once I start, I notice her over my shoulder. I look up and she's giggling and asked if I made a mess, with a kind of condescending baby voice, and I just kind of awkwardly laugh and say that I kind of missed and was just embarrassed to tell her. She kind of laughs and walks off and I don't really think anything of it.

The next week or so she just REALLY does not let it go. Every chance she gets she makes some remark about pee and missing and needing diapers, and just goes on with this kind of annoying baby voice. She does it any chance she gets and I really start getting annoyed after a bit. Even when we talk about something mundane, she feels the need to make a joke and I don't want to tell her to stop because we joke around a lot, but it is honestly getting annoying and I have to pretend it doesn't bother me. It makes me feel like a bit of a child and that she isn't taking me seriously. One day my mom calls just to see how I'm doing and we are just having the routine ""mom call"" kind of conversation. The conversation ends up being about something in my childhood, and my wife overhears and runs in with the baby voice and says ""OOOhhhhh baby PeePeeThroeaway made a messy wessy in the bathroom the other night."" I just kind of lose it at this point after having to deal with it for a few weeks and just shout ""SHUT YOUR F\*\*\*ING MOUTH WITH THIS SH\*T ALREADY"". As expected it just kind of gets awkwardly silent, and my mom says she would call me back another time.

&#x200B;

That night we don't really speak and I feel kind of guilty about yelling at her. I feel like I should apologize, but also she just wouldn't let this go even when she could tell it was making me a little bit uncomfortable.  AITA for yelling at her to shut her mouth?

I had everyone one wear his favorite color and it was outside in the most beautiful setting. I messaged his dad in FB messaged asking for help and he said “I’ll take care of the guest”. I don’t personally know his extended family to easily organize this.

His mom is best friends with HCMB who is polite to my face but rude and racist to me other wise (see previous post). For the most part she knows time and place so she wouldn’t say anything outwardly racist with so many people around. Something more so like “I’m so happy to be here with family because all of the Black people conversations are getting tiring”. She’s said that before amongst other things and it really only makes me uncomfortable because I’m the only Black person in a family. She always finds ways to sneak in comments that apparently no one is either bothered by or cares to comment on, if not chucking alongside here.

Anyways, his mom ALWAYS wants BM involved. I guess I didn’t want to deal with it and was selfish for that. So I just left it up to his dad (they’re divorced). I also know that his parents don’t get along.

He says that his mom is the one that raised him and it was fu**ed up. As soon as I got in the car he began driving erratically and calling me selfish and a narcissist. I know I have selfish tendencies sometimes but I didn’t think this was one. I surprised him with breakfast, a haircut, spa day , a football jersey and a few other gifts. I thought about him in all of this.

She was conceived out of wedlock and after I had an affair while with my then fiancée. I got the girl pregnant and kept this secret until a few weeks before the my daughter was born. Once she found out my then fiancee dumped me of course. I was going through some things at the time so the girl I cheated with wasn’t much of a class act. She ended up in jail about 7 months later and will be there for a very long time for child endangerment and cocaine possession. Luckily my daughter is only in my hands now.

My daughter being a result of my sleeping around is kinda like the elephant in the room. Most of us never talk about it because frankly it’s embarrassing for me, and I’m not sure if I ever want her to know how she was made. I say most people because my big sister loves to bring up how awful I am. She got divorced from her high school sweetheart 5 years ago because he cheated on her multiple times. She’s bitter and is now taking it out on me and my daughter. 2 Sundays ago, we had a family dinner with her kids, my daughter, our parents and our younger sister.

Before dinner we were chilling in our living room, after talking for a while about how we want our kids to grow up, she said,”Well let’s hope your daughter grows up more like your girlfriend than her mommy or daddy.” I asked what was wrong with me, and she said that my daughter was gonna have tons of men that want her someday, so she needs to learn to not run around on her partners, and obviously I can’t teach her that. I was offended but I let this slide, because she likes to say stupid things like this a lot. 

When we finally sat down to eat she was still cracking jokes at my expense. The final straw was when she told my girlfriend that, if we get engaged, she’d “better get ready for another baby because Mr. Manwh*re over there might wanna slip into another druggie behind another fiancées back”. I was incredibly pissed off. My girlfriend hates hearing about this, and I don’t like her having to think about how much I messed up two years ago. I also feel like it implies that I am ashamed to have my daughter from that situation which I am not. I told her she needed to stop acting like a b&tch. She told me she would if I learned to keep it in my pants. This escalated into yelling fight over dinner, eventually I got fed up with this and decided to leave with my party. While getting up my mom told me I was acting immature and needed to start thinking like an adult and not argue with my sister.

This set me off even more and I left without saying a word to my family. Since that night I’ve gotten calls and messages saying I needed to give an apology and I have refused every time. My girlfriend says I reacted to harshly but she understood where I came from. I haven’t talked to my sister since.

AITA?

Edit Okay I left this out, but at a point in my life, before me and my current GF got together, I may have been a serial cheater. I have cheated on every girlfriend or partner I’ve been with, except my girlfriend, at least once. I had some severe self worth problems and emotional issues. I fucked up, and I hate to say this but I didn’t learn my lesson until I cheated on two other girls between my ex fiancée and current girlfriend.

It wasn't planned. I didn't want to be a dad, but did the right thing and married her. She gave birth to a girl who is now 6. I tried to be a good father, bought her toys and shit. But things changed back in April when I found out that around the time my wife became pregnant, she was fucking around with a lot of guys and the kid may not even be mine. 

&#x200B;

I got a dna test done and turns out I'm not the father. My soon to be ex and I are in the process of getting a divorce. As soon as I found out about the kid not being mine I told my wife  to take her kid and get teh fuck out of my house. She went to live with her mother. When they were leaving, I didn't let the kid take any of the toys and stuff I had bought for her. I paid for them and she's not even my kid. My wife called me every name in the book but I stood my ground. 

Yesterday was the kid's birthday. My soon to be ex wife called me and told me I needed to be there for her birthday party. I told her to go fuck herself. I wasn't wasting anymore time and money for a kid that isn't even mine. She berated me for abandoning ""my daughter"" and how she's been crying for her ""father"". I told her to take the kid to her real father, whoever the fuck he is.

I'm picky about who I want to hangout with because I believe you really need to vibe to be friends. That said, I'm not a normally mean person, just selective who I really let in to my life. My bf (22m) knows this and asked if I wanted to go to dinner with a few of his military buddies. We are both in the army so this would be a great way for me to make some friends since I tend to vibe pretty well with other military people.

Anyway, so we go to this dinner at a family restaurant and there's 3 other guys and an air force girl. I shit you not when I say she was acting like a hoe all night and immediately didn't like her. Some examples of her behavior:

1. Calls her 2 yr kid a ""crotch goblin"" and brags that she ""pawns him off"" to her mother because she hates how much he cries 

2. Mentioned loudly and several times that she's slept with 2 of the guys also eating dinner. Also VERY in depth description of said sexual encounters.

3. Told my bf that she was going to steal me from him and showed me a picture of her breasts.

4.asked my bf if he would eat her ass later, winked, and slipped him her number

There's more but for the sake of the post, I'll stop there. So at one point, one of the guys was showing us a picture of a guys dick that had been bitten by a snake (he's fine now). As a medic, I really wanted to see purely out of curiosity. She kept trying to get him to put the phone away and making a big deal about how we were in a public restaurant and it wasn't appropriate. I had had too many drinks at this point and finally snapped and said something like ""why tf are suddenly concerned about you're public image? You've been acting like a hoe ALL night and OBVIOUSLY you've seen plenty of dick. Can't handle one more?""

She got pissed off, left in a huff after throwing water in my food, and called me a bitch. The guys all laughed and said she had it coming but I feel kinda bad. AITA?

ETA: forgot to mention she kept grabbing one of the guys dicks after he said no and had JUST had his fiancee of 5yrs leave him for a friend.

ETA: I apologize for not making it clear, but the rest of the group tried to politely get her to stop several times (both groping and comments). We were actually all being fairly respectful but she really took it to another level.

She was at Target and they had some gay pride merch up. We were on the phone while she was shopping. She said that she had found a $15 pouch that she had loved, but that she didn’t have the money for it. She has been in a really bad financial situation for quite a while now, and normally I’m the one she comes to when she needs some $ to get by until she gets paid. Anyways, a few minutes later, she found an onesie that had a rainbow on it and had “we’re all family” written on it. She said that she was going to buy it for the baby

Here’s the thing, my husband and I had already talked about how we would introduce the subject to our kid. We want our kid to be raised seeing that love is love and that his aunt and great-uncle (my husband’s uncle has been married to his husband for over 10 years) have the same kind of relationships and share the same love as we do. pretty much we dont want our kid to think differently about gay relationships. 

Also, my husband and I, even though we go out to gay bars with my SIL during pride week (actually not only during pride week lol) we have never worn any shirts or dressed up. So, since I knew that my SIL was really struggling with $$, I felt bad letting her buy the $5 onesie bc I didn’t know if my husband would be ok or not with the baby wearing it. So I told her to let me check with her brother (my husband) first before she bought it. 

That was all it took for her to REALLY upset. She started crying on the phone with me and started saying stuff like “you understand that your baby’s aunt is gay, right?!” And asked me if she was going to be able to have her gfs around the baby. Which, she knows that she obviously would! 
However, things escalated on her end and she said that she knew her brother wouldn’t have an issue with the onesie and that she thought that I was having an issue with the onesie and being homophobic. She said that she was shocked that I wouldn’t allow the baby to wear it and that she was really hurt but that now she saw how I really felt. Which, again, is crazy as she knows me and knows that some of my closest friends are gays. And at no point did I say anything about the baby not being allowed to wear it, I just wanted to make sure my husband wouldn’t oppose to it. That’s literally what I said.

I obviously felt horrible about the whole situation and if I had known that she would get so hurt I wouldn’t have said anything. But I did feel bad at the moment letting her spend her money on something I knew the baby might never wear. Anyways, I did bring the onesie up to my husband and he veto it (!!) So now she thinks I’m homophobic and has no idea that her brother was the one who didn’t really want the onesie. I feel like if I were to tell her that, she would get even more upset. 
She is known in the family for being dramatic and over sensitive, but we were REALLY close and I never would have thought things would get to this point.",2020-11-20 05:46:44,58,16,0.78,12,2,9,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our house is an old, four-story row home that was built in the 1920s, and although we keep it neat and clean, some parts of the house are just a little worn down from being a group home for so long. For example, the first floor of the house is all wood flooring, and although we sweep and vacuum it regularly, it is a bit dirty from the accumulate years of footsteps. 

One of my new roommates is a very close friend of mine from college who just moved to our city after living and working in Japan for almost 5 years. He's been a kind and considerate roommate, and I love spending time with him. However, he recently told me that he's planning on asking everyone in the house to take off their shoes in the entryway, since it really bothers him when people wear shoes inside. He talked about how, in Japan, everyone takes their shoes off before entering a house and puts on slippers, so as to keep the floor clean. While I want to be respectful of his wants and needs as a housemate, I am absolutely unwilling to take off my shoes EVERY time I enter the house. I also don't own a pair of ""house slippers"" like he does, and I frankly do not want to spend money on some. Our entryway is also very narrow, and it's already getting clutter by all of HIS shoes that he takes off before coming inside, so I don't think it's feasible for all 6 of us to take off our shoes. 

More than that, he suggested that we all deep clean the flooring on the first floor of the house, which would definitely require a ton of work and potentially paying a professional. He says that the dirty floor also really bothers him, and wants it to be clean so his house slippers don't get dirty. I am also unwilling to do this, since I already do the majority of sweeping, vacuuming, and cleaning up, so I do not want to have to scrub the floors in addition to the housework I already do. 

I told him that I didn't think it was practical to force everyone in the house to take off their shoes, and that he was asking a bit too much for someone who had just moved in. He told me that I was being inconsiderate of his needs and his Japanese 'culture' (he is white and was born in Oregon). He hasn't told our other roommates about this plan yet, but I really don't want to be the bad guy in this situation. On one hand, it wouldn't be THAT difficult for me to take off my shoes before coming inside, especially if this is something that really bothers him, but on the other hand, I feel like he's making demands of the rest of us and isn't willing to give any ground himself, even though this is a 6 person house and we all need to compromise.

Nonetheless our custody agreement worked out to me getting her around one week out of the month.

Yesterday, my ex wife starts ringing the doorbell 5 times in succession. I look at my phone and see a bunch of texts saying she was done with my daughter (14)’s attitude and needed to be away from her.

My new wife (34) is currently pregnant and her sisters are staying over at our home. I already had my week with my daughter at the start of September where she lived at the house.

My wife doesn’t want to deal with her stepdaughter right now because she’s pregnant and just wants to hang out with her friends and sisters in peace. Especially because she says she feels my daughter giving her stink eyes.

My ex wife kept on ringing the doorbell and my daughter texted saying she wanted to stay with me for a while. 

However, I refused to open the door because legally this wasn’t my one week a month and my wife and her sisters want to drive up an hour up to Hilton Head to do shopping and have a mini staycation.

We can’t do that with a 14 year old around and they’ve been planning this for a while now.

AITA? My ex wife keeps sending me “ thanks a lot” texts and my daughter says that nobody wants her but that’s her mother’s doing at the moment.",2020-09-13 19:26:49,438,950,0.85,138,0,5,139,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,

We have a good middle class income however my wife has extremely high student loans that we are trying to pay off within 5 years. We pool our money together and we each get a personal account for clothing, drinks/food with friends, hobbies etc. As a side note, my wife is frequently at a balance of $0 in that account as she spends it all. We roughly get $2k-$3k/year each for this.

We had originally planned a vacation in December that we are canceling due to the pandemic and have an ""extra"" $2k to use. I'd like to save the money or put it towards the student loans but since my wife had some recent accomplishments I thought it would be a good idea if we took half the money and got ourselves something nice. 

My wife is obsessed with Christmas and came to me and suggested we get a prelit family christmas tree. I don't care for holidays at all, and despite being annoyed that the idea isn't really something for the both of us, I asked her the price. $2k?!?! I immediately laughed in front of her because I thought she was joking and when I realized she wasn't I said No and I didn't want to discuss getting a tree that expensive.

I work in a business analyst role while my wife works at a marketing management role at very respectable companies where we live.

I can't for the life of me remember the last time we have been on a date. I don't remember her initiating anything. In the last year or so it’s like she is avoiding going out in general. And no, before anyone asks, she is not cheating, she just ""likes to work"" -\_-.

When covid happened, we had to stay at home and all, I thought this was a good opportunity for a house date. Nope. from 9am to 1am, work and sleep the rest. It did not help that on weekends or any breaks she took, she literally spent the whole day sleeping. She was mostly finished with her work and was taking up more work because it paid and that her coworkers or juniors messed stuff up and asked for her help. Every plan I made ends up coming second to work. This has been the source of regular arguments now and she promises to make it up but never does.

Last week, it was our 5th wedding anniversary and for me that was a big deal for me. I planned one month before for this day. since the covid restrictions were easing up in my area, I reserved a rather expensive restaurant and bought a platinum necklace for her. We were to meet at the house and leave at around 7pm for the 9pm reservation (restaurant was half an hour away but i wanted to visit the aquarium near the hotel.) At near 7 when she was a no show, I called her and she told me there was trouble at work because of her junior and she HAD to take over. I did not respond and just cut the call.

I met her sister 25F outside who lives with her parents, my in laws, a few streets away. She could tell I was pissed off and I gave her the cliff note version and she was just empathetic. I don't know why but I asked her if she wanted to go to that restaurant because I still had time to make the reservation. She accepted and even in laws had no problem (she is my little sis in a way). We made the reservation, had a nice chat and meal. I had the gift in my pocket and I decided to give that to wife’s sister who refused at first but I still insisted her to take it as an early birthday present and dropped her off home.

It blew up the next day when wife found out how I spent our anniversary and made a scene Infront of in-laws. That I betrayed her and my actions were disgusting, predatory to name a few. What pissed her off more was the gift I had given to her sister and now demanded I apologize by getting her a new necklace as such or sister give the one, I got for her initially. Here is where I was the AH by saying that I don’t get gifts for roommates, that maybe if you acted more like a wife than a roommate, I would consider. Even in laws took my side on this one and asked us to arrange another date this weekend. I refused and told her wife has to now.

Wife got angry and went to stay at a hotel. AITA here ?

Background: The school she (17F) goes to is the same one I (18F) attended before I left for college. Our school does as many valedictorians as 4.0's, but usually 1-2 salutatorians.

I graduated as a Valedictorian with a full ride to a Top 20 school (not trying to brag, just setting the stage). Because of this, a lot of people have come to me for homework and assignment help. I review/critique essays for $5 but usually don't write them. A senior DM's me one day and says, ""Hey, I know you're really good with Essays, and I'm so stressed that I don't think I'm going to be able to write my final paper for Dual English."" (it's an English class taken in partnership with a local college for college credit once she graduates) I ask her to explain to me what's going on and she says she's been so stressed with work and her other classes and trying to keep her GPA up that she doesn't have time.

I ask her how long the essay is and she says it's a minimum of 6 pages. I've done longer, so I'm not too worried. I tell her that finals and my own papers are coming up so I can get it done but it might take me a week or two. She says, ""it's due in three days."" I am blunt and tell her, ""If you want me to write it in three days, you're gonna have to pay me."" She's down and we agree on $30, to be sent once I tell her (and send the first paragraph as proof) I have finished.

I spend about five hours on this essay. I tell her I have finished it and she says, ""I know it's not due until tomorrow but I get extra-credit if I turn it in tonight."" I tell her that's fine as long as she pays me. She then says, ""I don't get paid until tomorrow. I promise I'll send the money then.""  I ask if she can do a down-payment of $10. She says yes and does. So, I send her the essay. She tells me to remind her the next day just in case she forgets.

I remind her. She leaves me on read. I remind her again, and she says, ""I didn't get paid as much as I would like to. I'll pay you next week."" I argue with her and tell her that isn't the agreement. She removes me from her followers list (not blocking).

So, I email her professor and tell him I wrote her final essay for her.

I get another message from her the next day, and she says he gave her a zero for the final and she'll end up with a C in the course without it, causing her to lose her salutatorian status she ""worked so hard for"". I told her she should've thought about that before pulling what she did. My friends are mixed about it, but some of them are friends with her inner circle. AITA?

Update: No one asked, but I figured some honesty was necessary. A few weeks ago, I saw a post on my main account about a girl who made up a story for research purposes for a class. While I did not make this story up, it was not me it came from. I am actually a current junior on my University's honor council. This semester, we were coursed with coming up with more appropriate punishments for violations based on three factors: how the general public would view our school after, the behavior of the student after confrontation, and the severity of the violation. 

This particular case is from the 2017 school year, and the girl who committed the violation is now a senior after receiving a warning her freshman year, along with a requirement to complete an academic honesty training course. Her attitude throughout the process was deemed as ""haughty and falsely superior"". I tried responding to comments in ways that reflected that and in ways that reflected someone more conscious of their moral misjudgment. The responses I received from those two behaviors cary greatly. 

For those who commented and I replied to, I am deeply sorry if my logic came off as harsh. It is hard to come up with an argument for something you disagree on. Our final meeting is Friday, and I am excited to share (anonymously) the opinions you have provided. ",2020-11-18 02:18:43,36,30,0.91,5,0,2,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My parents have been fixing some things in the kids bathroom, which is right next to my room upstairs. In my bedroom closet, there’s a panel that allows access to the plumbing of the shower.

I (17F) have been in online classes all day. After my last class, my iPad died, so I went upstairs to grab my charger and found my room absolutely ransacked. 

I’ll admit, my room has never been the cleanest. It probably hasn’t ever been fully clean. Before corona, my schedule was absolutely insane, and during corona, my mental health has plummeted. My parents have consistently been on me for years now to clean my room. I’ll get sudden bursts of motivation, get halfway there, and then everything piles up again. 

The room is a mess, but I always know where everything is. It’s organized chaos, in a way. To make it clear: this is not the way I want to live, but my bedroom isn’t really my top priority right now, as I’m in the college application process.

They very clearly did not take any care when moving my things off the floor. Things are all over my bed, all around my bed, and I have no idea where anything is now.

What I’m really upset about is the fact that they didn’t even tell me. I had to find out for myself. I know it’s not huge in the grand scheme of things, but my room is the only personal space I have. Walking in to find it like that was a huge shock and felt like an invasion of my privacy. I told my parents this much, but they say if my room had been clean (read: if my sh*t had been picked up) this wouldn’t have been an issue to begin with, and that I don’t have any personal space as the house belongs to them. Their argument is that they had to do it to reach the panel in the closet for the plumbing, and maybe now that my stuff is on my bed I’ll finally put it away. I think I may be the asshole because my room wasn’t clean enough for them to reach the panel, despite them telling me to clean it constantly.

I really would have just appreciated a heads up.

My wife and I got together 4 years ago, had an unplanned pregnancy with 3m early on, and have been living together since. 11f is my daughter from a previous reationship. 

The house is a 4 bedroom, but one bedroom is just a loft on the 4th floor and another bedroom is so small that it would only be okay for one person, even if they were a child. 

The loft has a bathroom, the two good-sized bedrooms have ensuite bathrooms, but the small 4th bedroom would have to go into someone else's room for a bathroom. 15m and the twins are very close to each other, but have never gotten along with 11f. The oldest 3 ganged up on 11f at the slightest issue, and had no problem excluding her regardless of anything we tried to do. Even now, they will manipulate 3m into ignoring 11f by making it subtly clear that giving 11f attention leads to them excluding 3m. 

When we first moved in together, we tried all of the girls together in the loft, but the fighting was so bad that we put 15m and the twins together in the loft, gave 11f one of the bedrooms, and used the small room as the nursery. Now we have another baby, and the small room isn't big enough for two. We need to move rooms around again.  

My wife wants to put the youngest two in 11f's old room, put 15m in the small room and make the loft the girls' room. I know that the babies need more space and that someone is losing something, but I think 11f needs to maintain her own room, even if she would have to walk through what would be the new nursery for a bathroom. She deserves her own space because she is unfortunately more alienated than she should be and deals with more conflict. 

My wife is adamant that the single bedroom should go to 15m because ""he's way too old to be with the girls"". She won't acknowledge that her kids hate 11f and says they all just need to ""deal with it and get over it"". She was an only child so she just doesn't understand what sibling relationships are or that her oldest 3 are unnaturally close even for that. Even besides that, if 15m got the small room, he would still have to use the loft bathroom due to his height, which could lead to problems.

Five years ago I went to university and had a lot of money (student loans) for the first time in my life. I went a bit crazy and ended up in debt of about £1000. My mum had to pay it off.

I left university after a year and a half because I wasn’t coping mentally. At that point it was decided that there would be two bank accounts- one my money went into it and that I couldn’t access and one that I could access. Every week my dad would take some money from the first account snd put it in my account.

This system worked and once I proved I could manage weekly it moved to a monthly amount of money, this time handled by my mum. At this point I was back at uni and had student loans again. My mum was saving some of the loans because we weren’t sure I’d get full funding for my final year. 

As it turns out we did. So I was left with £5000 in a bank account I cannot touch. My sister and I decided to go on a celebratory trip to disney world and universal studios and mum agreed to let me use my £5000 to pay for it. That was last year.

The pandemic means I am at home living with my mum and currently jobless. I graduated university but have struggled to find work. I get £342 a month in unemployment. 

My sister and I have had to rearrange our holiday twice. This is made extra complicated because I don’t know how much money is in my account and I’m not allowed to make any decisions using that money without asking my mum first. 

I got fed up of this and said to my mum that I am an adult who should be allowed to do what she likes with her money and not have to go through my mother. It is my money and I am the only one who gets a say in what I do with it.

I said I’d be willing to sit down and sort out a proper budget and everything but mum blew up at me. Said she’s had to bail me out before and she’s not doing it again and that she thinks I’ll spend it all and need bailing out again etc.

The thing is, my older brother (now 30) has always been terrible with money. Mum bailed him out for almost a decade; she must have given him over £10,000 over the years. She never once tried to control my money like she does mine.

So I can’t help but feel like I must have missed something that explains why she’s treating me so differently. Sometimes I miss things in conversations due to my autism.",2020-11-14 02:57:40,39,39,0.85,3,0,5,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the first one celebrating with my family with my Fiancé, as a separate party from my parents, and we brought dessert and wine.

As long as we’ve done this, we’ve always served buffet style, cleaned our own plates and helped wrap up dinner as a group. 

I’ve always gone out of the way to help, whether its set up, getting drinks, bringing out food. Whatever it is, I’ve always made myself available.

For some reason, this year my grandfather decided to hand out “assignments” during dinner, singling out my sisters boyfriend and young cousin. He specifically said “you need to clean the plates, stack them, rinse them, and put them away.” Keep in mind, this is extremely odd, theres never been problems with cleanup. I’ve always done this, and everyone is very respectful. Sisters BF joked that he guessed he was still a pledge here, and thats honestly how it felt.

My uncle apparently had a problem that his son was asked to do this and complained, why cant OP and his sister do it? So my grandpa decided its now our job to clean their table. 

Initially, I brushed this off, it was out of character and I was a little offended he felt the need to assign us their table to clean. I suppose I felt this way because it’s something I’ve always done on my own terms, and my uncles complaining irked me. So I went about dinner, helped stack our plates and let my cousin take them to the sink. Grandpa comes in ask condescendingly says “Ok, group two, we’re ready.” Odd.

I walked in to help, and the everyone is up from the table set around the room ready to watch us clean their stuff up.

I am staying at a friend’s (Thiago) house for the next two weeks. It was a rather unexpected thing, but my friend’s family are chill, and now I am in their house.

Today was the first breakfast, and Thiago’s mom made a lot of food, of which scrambled eggs was included. I get a helping of scrambled eggs, and the mom asks me if I would like toast. So I ask her for what, since I’m eating eggs.

“For the eggs.”

What.

So I go, no, eggs do not belong in toast. Eggs are to be eaten in their pure eggy form. The only exception is boiled eggs. That is for toast. Thiago overhears me, and he goes no, you can put them on toast. Seriously.

I am not eating scrambled eggs on toast. His sister (Maria) is now annoyed, and she asks me if I am trying to be funny, by pretending that I don’t eat scrambled eggs on toast, and I explain, again, that this is an awful idea, and that they can all do it however they want, I am not desecrating eggs like that.

Thiago for some reason is finding it funny, and he asks me if I have ever noticed that nearly everyone else eats scrambled eggs on toast, and that in this situation, I am actually the odd one out. 

This is confusing and distressing information, and I‘m like “WHY.” No one in my house does it. We all eat eggs without toast. Boiled eggs go on toast. Nothing else. (I also realise now that sometimes people add butter which ??? WHY.) 

For the most part, this is still light-hearted, but Maria gets annoyed, and demands I eat eggs properly, and I’m not doing that, because it is going to be a sensory hell, and I respect eggs. Maria now thinks I am lying about not knowing that, and the more I explain that I am completely serious. The more confused I get as to why eggs belong on toast, the harder Thiago, his parents and brother laugh, and the more annoyed Maria gets and tries to convince me I must’ve known.


Maria is now super pissed, and I’m no longer doing hot, because she is yelling, and Thiago intervenes with a “Leave them alone, they’re weird, wait until you see how they eat salads,” and Maria leaves (without having breakfast), after insulting me.*

Maria clearly thinks I am an asshole for how I eat eggs, so reddit, AITA for everything that happened? Should I just have shut up?

My (23M) girlfriend (24F) and I are both on low FODMAP diets, basically, we can’t eat a variety of foods because they upset our insides.

We (mutually) decided that with COVID we would treat ourselves to a night free from restrictions just to break up the drudgery of day to day life with the way things were going and ordered a meal from a delivery app that bore none of our dietary restrictions.

We had a lovely meal and night and went to bed with no issues. Here is the part where I may be the asshole. I wake up in the night and my guts are quaking, I feel vile. I rush to the toilet and lock the door, this is going to be a big one. 

I sit down and to my surprise nothing happens, just chaotic gurgles coming from my belly, so I relax and hope nature will take it’s course. I’m sitting there for what must have been ten minutes. I’m actually on the verge of falling asleep and hear this frantic banging on the door and shouting, well, it scares the shit out of me, all of the pent up nightmare inside me comes out in full force. My frame of consciousness widens from solely the task at hand after the initial wave and I realize my girlfriend is what let the flood gates go loose.

She is shouting through the door saying she really needs to go and can’t hold it any more, I can hear the desperation in her voice and I know she is in the exact same situation as me but I know I don’t have enough time between blasts to even get up and open the door for her to get in and use the sink or the shower and she goes in her pants.

She’s saying I could have snapped it off half way but it wasn’t that sort of number two, so AITA?

Basically my brain is like ""What would be the worst possible thing you can say in this situation"" and then I say it.

It sucks. It's so much better with online school though. Anyways one of my tics is really offensive to a certain race of people, I am part of that race but it's still weird to just yell it for no reason.

Most of my close friends understand my tics and laugh about them and I also have friends who also have Tourette's. I was hanging out with some friends and one of them brought their neighbor who was new to the area and looking to meet new people.

She had all these misconceptions about tourrettes like that if I tic someone I secretly mean it or sometimes I could just yell swear words for the fun of it, or that I just shouldn't go into restaurants and stuff because of it. Well then I had the \*offensive word\* tic out of literally nowhere. Keep in mind she is not a part of the race it offends.

She kept telling me to apologize and I was like ""to who?"" and she was like ""Everyone"" even though she was the only one who seemed to care. My friends are pretty good at ignoring my tics. I was like ""Why does it bother you? Your not \*certain race\*""

She replied ""Well I have this thing called empathy and I care about other people when you are bullying them?"" Most of my friends stepped in and tried to educate her and also say that I was allowed to say it either way. She wouldn't listen and was insistent that I secretly meant it.

But AITA for not apologizing. I feel like I didn't have to make a big scene and I could have just said sorry but it kinda hurts when I'm apologizing for something I didn't mean over and over again.",2020-11-26 16:52:41,22,18,0.87,3,0,3,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I share walls on both sides of my condo and my neighbors on the right are no problem ever. But the neighbors on my left are a different story.

On a regular basis, they let their dog roam unleashed, they don't pick up after their dog, and pretty often flick their cigarette butts (still lit) into our bush.
Lately (for the past 2 weeks or so) my house *reeks* of my other neighbor's cooking. The smell from the food is so strong and so regular that it's now in my clothes. I can't even open my windows because the smell is so overpowering. 

Additionally, I've noticed they've been working out of and storing cooked food in their garage (the garages are detached and in the center of our community). They've been having large units (of what, I don't know.. even if I looked, I would be able to tell. It covered with wood and shrink wrap.) on pallets delivered and whoever drops it off, takes something from their garage. When the truck (a regular pickup) comes by to drop of ""the pallet,"" it's for about 30-40 minutes at a time and blocks either my car port parking spot or my garage. 

Carrying trays of food and transporting whatever they received, they have to pass my door to so. And when it is happening, it's regularly been all day. Like from 10am to maybe midnight. Sifting and putting whatever in a machine that makes a lot of noise. From the backyard to the garage that sits about 100-150 feet from my front door. I bring that up because it's not like I've spied on them. I don't hold a glass up to the wall to hear, I don't hold up a mirror to look. 

Whatever is going on is pungent, is loud, and is something that I consider a nuisance.

I've thought about talking to them, but I don't think that is safe (pandemic and whatnot) to talk to them m, as they have a lot of people that don't live there coming through the house. And I've considered that this might be how they're getting by for now.

I've been fighting with myself about whether or not I should say anything to the HOA property manager. I don't want to cause problems, especially since we are all home *all* day. I might be going stir crazy, but I just want to open my windows and enjoy the fresh air at some point of the day.

Now that's probably an exaggeration, but probably because I'm asexual, it feels accurate. Their only friends are polys like them, and I hate that too. So I went to my mom house for thanksgiving. I expected her ex-boyfriend (basically a baby daddy of my brother) to be there and maybe my brothers, but apparently, there's going to be four more people there (well exceeding the 6 person rule) and they aren't family, they're just hoes.

We weren't best friends or anything but we mostly kept in touch during birthdays and holidays through college and then fell out of contact.

I left her on read hoping that she would get the message and she didn't contact me for a while before going back to birthday and holiday posts. Over the past few months her social media is almost completely about Monat and how she's a boss babe and her business is covering her rent. She recently made a post about how much money people could make if they ""just worked hard enough"" like her.  I can't take her MLM shit anymore.

It would be shitty of me, but I really want to send her a message back about how turned her social media and relationships into a profit pool, how Monat isn't a personality trait, and ask if she feels good about making money off the backs of her friends downline.

This would definitely ruin any remaining friendly feelings towards each other, but would it be an asshole move?

Edit: forgot to add that she messaged me after the ""just work hard enough"" post and pitched it again

Edit 2: whoring was a really bad choice and I shouldn't have use it. I am absolutely an AH for using it. What I was trying to say was that I'm felt hurt that it seem like she's turning what used to be a meaningful relationship into an opportunity to make more money. I hate that she turned into someone who only seems to care about me and my other youth group friends as potential profits.

Last edit: thank you for the replies and judgement. This post is coming from a place of hurt and I was absolutely TA for using the words I did. I'm gonna tell her no to joining, have a good cry about losing a friend, and maybe reach out in a few months to see if we can have a relationship outside of this MLM. Thank you for the kick in the pants, I can see that I have a lot of growing to do if this is my response to a perceived hurt. ",2020-11-17 23:53:49,42,14,0.85,7,0,1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This isn't lewd erotica so I'll keep this simple. I was born with a genetic disability. You can't tell from looking at me but it was very challenging growing up. So much so I vowed to myself never to have children. I bet you can already see where this is going.

When Banjo was about 6 months old we came home from work to him limping around and not putting weight on his front left leg. We took him to the vet and he had broken his leg, we aren’t exactly sure how but we think he probably fell down the stairs or something. 

We felt bad for him so we gave him a ton of extra treats and attention while he was in his cast and when he limped around. A few weeks after his cast came off, Banjo had randomly started limping again so we took him back to the vet. The vet told us that he wasn’t injured and that sometimes dogs will fake being hurt especially if they know they get attention and treats from it. Since then, every once and a while when Banjo believes he hasn’t gotten enough attention or treats that day he will start limping around and acting like he’s in pain. We’ve definitely reinforced his behavior because we always give him treats and love whenever he’s ‘hurt’. 

We had my cousin over yesterday and Banjo limps into the living room and dramatically plops onto his bed and sighs loudly. My husband and I laugh because we think his dramatics are funny and we explain it to my cousin. She told me that we need to take him to the vet because he could be hurt. We try to tell her that he does it solely for the attention and he’s definitely not actually in any pain. She tells us that is doesn’t really matter because he might not be faking it one day and could actually be in pain. I tell her that taking him to the vet every time he’s ‘hurt’ would be a waste of time for us and for the vet because there is nothing wrong with him. It’s also $50 per visit to the vet and since he’s ‘hurt’ at least twice a week that’s $5,200 that we are giving the vet for him to tell us Banjo is dramatic. My cousin told us that we ‘shouldn’t own pets if we aren’t willing to properly afford to care for them’ and that the ASPCA should come take Banjo and find him a home that actually cares about him. She ended up storming out telling  us she was going to call the ASPCA on us. Banjo is both my husband and I's first dog so we aren't experts but taking him to the vet that often is ridiculous right.

It really sucks losing a girlfriend, especially when I’m the one that broke it off because I wasn’t 100% sure what I wanted and she was practically begging for a ring on her finger. We were together for little over a year and I just don’t think I’m ready for marriage. I’m still trying to finish up school and figure myself out before I’m ready to commit my life to someone like that. But it got to the point where it would negatively effect our relationship. The conversation of being life-time partners started to come up very often and would usually end in tears and tension. I couldn’t let that drag on any longer. I figured it was the best thing for me and for her to end it. But that doesn’t mean it was easy for me. I took it pretty hard and naturally I looked to my friends for support. One friend in particular has been a long time friend. We have been best friends for 8 years. I’ve been through thick and thin with him. Everything from being an emotional support for him through break ups to bailing him out of jail for getting into a physical altercation with a girlfriend (now ex-girlfriend). However, when I needed him, he was nowhere to be found. In the sense that he would take days to text me back. Was always too busy to hang out and kick it like we used to. The worst part was that he had no problem finding the time to hang out with my ex-girlfriend and her friends on the weekends. They would go to bars and participate in activities that we used to all do together. This made me pretty upset. I was furious. I felt like the bro code had been broken in so many ways. Why would he rather spend time with her than with me? There’s not many reasons I can think of... seemed like a classic case of being the nice guy that’s making sure the newly-single and emotionally vulnerable girl has some support (wink,wink). I took it upon myself to tell my ex-girlfriend to tread carefully as he may just be looking to get into her pants. When he found out about this little conversation, it lead to an inevitable texting boxing match, but hey, this is the most he’s talked to me in a while so that’s a positive right? Our friendship at this point is unsalvageable I think. Perhaps it may seem too far of a jump to conclusion to accuse him of trying to get with my ex-girlfriend, but she has complained to me multiple times of him flirting with her while we were still together.

Just some context, me and my dear old dad haven’t had a good relationship. Every since I was a kid, I picked up on the fact that he resented me. This kinda fed into my suspicion I was adopted. He was never physically abusive but was absolutely emotionally abusive to me as a kid. 

I have 2 sisters one older(28) and one younger(22) and my dad is extremely loving to them. I was always jealous and *HATED* my sisters for it until I was like 22. Me and them have since reconciled and now have  relationships. Me and my dad didn’t find some common understanding until like last year and still he is very withholding. He’s never once hugged me, he hasn’t said he loves me in nearly 20 years, every time I went to him for advice he’d berate me. He has told me on multiple occasions that I am a regrettable stain on our family. 

Honestly I wanted to just cut him out of my life but him and my mother are still together, and my mom wants me to have a better relationship with him. She was the one I went to after my dad hurt me, she was extremely loving and compassionate to me, she always told me that my dad was trying to show me how to be a man. 

I got everyone in my family at my place Saturday so o could make my discovery known to the whole family. I told them I knew I was adopted and my mom started crying. My dad then said, “You’re not adopted you’re just not mine.” Me and my sisters just sat there with mouths agape. I asked what that was supposed to mean.

According to my dad, my mom fucked one of her coworkers for a few months in 1993 and got knocked up with me. When she got pregnant, she ended the affair and just hoped I’d be my dads. When I was 3, my mom shacked back up with my bio dad and was caught white handed. They got a DNA test on me and my older sister, and a prenatal paternity test on my younger sister when mom found out she was pregnant again. I’m the only one that wasn’t his.

Upon learning I was so enraged at my mom and her husband, I yelled at them for making me find this out when I was 26 and not younger. I yelled at my dad saying, “Why the fuck would you stay in my life and show me so much hate. I couldn’t help it, I’m not the wh*re who couldn’t keep her legs closed.” And gestured at my mom. She began weeping and begged her husband to leave. They left and it was just me and my sisters, my baby sister was still crying and was pissed at my mom and dad, while my older sister was mad at me.

She told me I was being dramatic and wanted to put on a whole show, then called me a monster for speaking to my mother that way. I said she was being a wh@re, and my sister went off on me for sl?t shaming our mom. They both eventually left not before my older sister told me I was a massive asshole and needed to apologize.

I (19F) am living in a 2 bedroom apartment with my roommate (20F) Lily. We have been living together for a year and a half rather harmoniously while attending the same college. With 6 months left on our lease, she moved back in with her parents in a foreign country since we have online school this year. The past four months have been great having the apartment to myself. 

Last week she informed me that for December and January which are the last two months of our lease, she  will not be able to send the rent and that she wants to sublet. I told her that that’s fine as long as she can find someone who will move in in the next couple weeks as December is approaching. 

Today, she messaged me a long essay about the reasons why she can’t send the rent the next two months and that she cannot find a subletter. She said that her parents had been laid off due to covid and that they’re mad at her for spending money on rent when she could have stayed home since last may when lockdowns started. They’re refusing to give her money. I was shocked and confused because legally, our landlord will have to sue the both of us as both of our names are on the lease. I told her that as much as I understand her situation, she has to get a loan from the bank or something because she can’t just not pay rent??? 

Our conversation really started to turn sour when I realized that what she really wanted me to do was ask my parents for the money because she knew that my parents would probably rather just pay her rent rather than have to deal with legal issues. (My dad is a lawyer and he hates frivolous suits that waste time). Anyways, i really feel like I’m getting played here and I feel betrayed by someone who was my best friend. Needless to say, our relationship is forever ruined. She ended the call saying that she will not be paying rent and that her friends will come by to collect her things. 

Here’s the juicy part. My roommate has many designer goods in her closet including, but not limited to, clothes, shoes, and bags. If i sold some of these items on craigslist or something I definitely would be able to pay her share of the rent. However, I’m not sure how much of an asshole this would make me. Don’t give me legal advice, I’m just asking for ethical guidance because when I told my boyfriend he said i was a huge AH and that I should just tell my dad who will sort it out. (But i already know that he will just pay her portion and I really don’t like feeling.. used even if it is my parents’ money) I think I might be an AH because this is a snake move. 

WIBTA if i sold her things to pay her portion of the rent


INFO: there was a month last year where my roommate paid her rent a couple weeks late and the landlord sent us mail threatening to sue us. I reached out to her and said it was my roommates small mishap and she told me to watch out for more violations because they have company policies where they sue the tenants after a set number of weeks that goes by without receiving full rent, and she explicitly told me that we would both be sued if one of us didn’t pay. The landlord/manager that I deal with doesnt really have sway over company policy so i am presuming that they will not be lenient.",2020-11-19 13:10:20,39,14,1.0,5,0,8,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My wife’s birthday was 2 weekends ago. We had planned to go on a long camping trip (6 days) and everything was all set and paid for. 

Roughly 3 days before departing, my wife got into another huge fight with our 12 yo son. They’ve been getting into small arguments and butting heads more and more but nothing like this. Apparently he was playing Minecraft on her laptop and downloaded something that crashed the computer. Nothing too terrible but my wife was worried her computer was permanently broken.

So there was a pretty easy solution to everything: go to a repair shop. But like always it devolved into a massive fight between them because our son was adamant he didn’t do anything wrong and my wife was adamant he did. 

It eventually got so bad my wife threatened to send him to stay with our neighbor by himself while we went on our trip if he doesn’t confess. He says fine leave without me. So my wife made up her mind to actually leave him with the neighbor for 6 days while we go on our trip. 

I tried to mediate but it’s the night before and my wife is still set on dropping him off at the neighbor’s. He’s also upset and has packed his stuff in preparation. At this point I basically put my foot down and said there’s no way in hell we’re actually doing this. This is insane, we’re a family, and if we can’t go together we shouldn’t go at all.

Long story and lots of drama short, the trip was cancelled. My wife refused to let our son come along and I refused to leave him behind. As a result she’s accused me of ruining the one week this year that she’s been excited for. I don’t know if I did the right thing in the end.

**Edit:** to everyone asking about how the laptop broke. It’s a really old computer and my wife accidentally spilled orange juice over it roughly a year ago when the problems started. The computer honestly crashes all the time. I’ve got no doubt my son’s games overtaxed it and crashed it again, but I don’t think his games were to blame for the problems starting.

**Edit2:** my son did have permission to play games and download specific mods related to the game (limited to a site we trust) without our knowing. So he didn’t really break any rules by playing the game or downloading. But the laptop was in increasingly poor shape and what used to be fine no longer was. My wife just seemed to forget about all the other times the laptop crashed and pinned every problem on this one instance.",2020-08-20 14:39:50,665,2956,0.95,20,0,105,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,

New here so don’t mind my format . I (21f) got angry with my best friend (26f) tonight for leaving me on read and flat out ignoring me to do drugs and drink . I have cancer and I’m on my final treatment as every other treatment has failed and this one isn’t looking too promising . I got told I would have a year , maybe 18 months left if it fails . 15% success rate . I’ve made my peace with it and sadly I’m not getting any better . Sometimes I have my mini meltdowns that I deal with in private because this is some very heavy stuff to deal with at times and I feel like a bother when I come to people about it . My best friend knows what’s happening in my life . My best friend also lost her mom to cancer 6 months ago and I was there for her for everything . I even helped out with paying the bills . So I try not to bother her with my sickness too much as it still seems like a touchy subject . I had a mini melt down and called her crying . I told her I needed a friend just to grab coffee or anything so I wouldn’t be alone with my thoughts . After a couple minutes of talking she said she’s using the washroom and will call me right back . 15 minutes go by and no call , so I phone her 3 times (we usually call and call each other until someone picks up if it’s important) , no answer . Sent her a snap because I was really in a dark place and needed my best friend . She opened it and didn’t reply . So I left it at that and just went home to try calm down . I see she posted to her private story on snap chat so I looked at it and seen that she was doing coke and having some white claws with some mutual friends . I absolutely lost it . I was livid , I was so hurt . So I texted her saying “if you didn’t want to talk to me you could’ve just said so . I was there for you during the most hardest time of your life, yet I couldn’t get 15 minutes of your time during my darkest days . When I die please don’t post how we were always there for each other and don’t bother mourning my death . Now f*ck off.“ ..... I understand that she lost her mother 6 months ago and I’ve been 4 years sober now (since I was first diagnosed with cancer). She knows it doesn’t bother me to be around drugs or alcohol . Now that I’ve calmed down I kind of feel bad . Should I apologize ? We’ve been friends since I was in pampers and I love her dearly . I understand her mother died , but I have feelings as well . I was in such a dark place I just needed my bestie to listen and hear me out. AITA?",2020-11-21 07:18:02,18,40,0.87,2,0,7,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Im a loud person, not that I mean to be, and shes yelled at me in the mornings before for being too loud, that I will wake the baby and prevent her from sleeping, so I changed and am quieter in the mornings.... but what im gathering from her is that she wants me to deal with him crying, her watching TV, and keeping all the lights on while I'm trying to sleep for work... and i just feel like there is some sort of double-standard or some shit going on, cause she doesnt sleep until a couple of hours after he falls asleep and then they both sleep for like 12 hours.

Most of the time I have the patience to deal with all of that while trying to sleep and actually manage to fall asleep... but every once in a while I'd just like a quiet room. Im a construction worker. I do manual labor all day, my body hurts, my mind is tired, and I just want to go to sleep.. and not on an unfucking comfortable couch

I definitely feel like an asshole cause I yelled at her in our argument about going to the living room for a couple of hours until the baby is ready to sleep. But if have to be quiet and supportive of her eleep habits, I dont get why she doesnt have to do the same for me.

The account had $210k now it has 72k (during this time the market went up).......  When my dad found out about this he flipped out. I felt bad for them but then my mom said its okay this is the risk with stocks they go up and they go down. That see what happens in 10 years.

The day after the wedding, on our post-wedding lunch, my MIL brought up that it was SIL to be wed next. My husband and I thought nothing of it at first, SIL and her BF were just 6 months into their relationship then, and they are not even engaged.

A few days later, while texting with a cousin, her congratulating me and the wedding and stuff, she told me that during the reception SIL announced that she'll be getting married next and basically took it as a chance to invite their side of the family. This, and the fact that she changed into another dress in the reception irked me. (All in the entourage wore the same gown and her changing made her stand out in the pictures)

NGL, I felt disrespected. I have been to many weddings and I've read enough reddit to know that you don't do that on someone's wedding.

I told my husband how I felt and he told me my feelings are valid. I waited for him to talk to his sister about it but he never did. I understood though as he's naturally introvert and it's in his nature to avoid conflict. I never brought it up myself as we have this deal ever since we've started dating to ""deal with your own side of the family"".

We kinda already forgot about it (cue pandemic) and have never thought of it again. We thought their wedding is going to be pushed back a few years cause of the gathering restrictions in our country.

Now a couple of months ago, she announced her wedding date, Jan 31. Our wedding was January 26. My husband's birthday is January 30. My birthday is January 28. I was furious. There are a lot of dates in the calendar. Why near the special days for us?

My husband told me she's so used to having the attention on her and can't take it when someone else is in the spotlight. She's a very sweet person though so everyone in the family is under her spell. We're afraid of bringing it up and just be told that we're just making a big deal out of it and/or we're the AH for not wanting to share our special day with a ""family"".

Now I'm thinking of planning a special trip for my husband and I on our anniversary/birthday. That is a valid excuse to not attend SILs wedding.

I'll tell them when the date is getting near cause I don't want to have a big confrontation and/or I don't want his fam to guilt trip us into attending. 

AITA?

Add: no im not claiming January as what some comments imply. I might have worded that poorly so it's my bad. What made me upset is that she chose the date expecting us to just not have plans and be there. It didn't matter that we told her when she first mentioned it that we are planning to be away around that time. (Hence saying a trip is already booked sounded a good idea, we already told them before) She still booked the date. As our birthdays are so close together, if we aren't out of the country, we always have just 1 big party on my husband's birthday. If family are already expecting to drive 3 hours to attend her wedding, I'm already expecting them to not be there for ours.

Lastly, I know my judgment is flawed and I accept that my hurt could be clouding my rationale, which is why is opted to ask here. I'm an introvert too and I can't talk about this with my fam so I chose to ask strangers instead.

I'm just hurt by the fact that I am expected to be of decorum when I didn't even get the same courtesy.",2020-11-18 02:43:28,44,12,0.88,3,0,6,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dad: MOM SAID YOURE GROUNDED. THAT GAME ISNT IMPORTANT, ITS A FUCKING GAME. 

My dad later half-apologized, telling me when he needs something done he needs it done now. He said that he can tell me “hang on” because what he’s doing is usually more important than what I’m doing.

We have talked about therapy over and over. She goes... sometimes? I used to try to make her feel better every time she cried... until I realized nothing I say or do makes a difference anymore. 

Yesterday we were both hungry and so instead of me normally going to go to get it for us, I asked instead if she wanted to pick up the food  for us right down the road. (Hoping she says yes because I can’t remember the last time I had time alone) she says “if you come with me, yeah” . This upset me so much because it meant that I had to do it no matter what. (There’s been times in the past where she was unable to do basic things and I had to do them on my own and it really frustrate me) 

Anyway, I go to pick up the food and my online order didn’t work and I didn’t have my card with me. So I wasn’t getting the food and I was driving back home entry handed, That made me even more upset. As I come in, she can tell I’m frustrated and I tell her “I’m just not in the mood right now” “I’m not in a good mood” and she knows that when I say that it means I’m asking for space. 

Well she doesn’t take space very well. Instead of her leaving me alone, she starts to ask me  “what are you eating?” “Is it good?” “What are you watching?” 

I admit I was a little rude when I snapped back asking her why she’s all of a sudden so curious what I’m doing and especially at a time I asked her to leave me alone. 

This was yesterday. She has been moping and crying for the past two days. She bought a 6 pack earlier and is now on her last beer after crying back and forth in the bathroom and in my car and in the bathroom and back to my car.

I really just want to shove headphones in at this point. I feel bad for her, I really do. And I’ve tried to help her in the past get over her fears and anxieties. But nothing I say helps. I can’t sit there and pretend everything is okay when she refused to give me space and then has been making a scene these past two days. 

She will inevitably say that I “shut her out” and “ignored her” and she’s right to an extent. I was upset that she couldn’t just do the simple thing of getting the food on her own. And I would have told her why I was upset, and I will tell her why I was upset, but she knew I wanted space and then proceed to cling on me harder... and then when I told her again I wanted space again, she mopes next to me for TWO DAYS so technically I still haven’t gotten my space!

He's now in a relationship, so he's stopped having fuck-buddies and hooking up, but he's not shy to talk about his ""glory days"".

Anyway, we had a get-together on Friday and another one of my friends, Harry, was telling us how he has some issues with the woman he's seeing, so Luke thought it fell on him to ""educate"" Harry and impart his wisdom. He started going on about how Harry's girlfriend is only acting out because he's not ""playing the field"" at all and that he needs is to make her aware that he has other options beside her.

We all kinda thought he was joking at first, but it soon became clear he was serious, so Harry told him he's not interested in doing that and to grow up.

Luke insisted and told Harry that nothing drives women more than competition, so even if he doesn't have anything else going on, he should still let her think that he does, just to make her jealous a bit.

Harry told him to cut it out and that he's not qualified to give dating advice anyway. 

He laughed and said that he that if anyone knows what he's talking about in this table, it's him, cause he's the most experienced of all of us (which is technically true).

I had started getting annoyed at Luke too, so I jumped in at that point and told him that if he really knew what he was talking about, then he wouldn't have ended up dating a 35-year-old with a toddler for his first serious relationship.

Everyone else laughed, but Luke didn't find it funny at all and asked me what the fuck did I mean by that. 

So I told him that if he's such an authority on dating, then he could probably do better.

He said he's perfectly happy with his partner and told me to stay in my lane.

I told him to take his own advice and to stop offering his opinion when no one asked for it.

Things were a bit tense after that, but we moved on from the subject. Still, was I the Asshole for piling on? I know it was a low-blow, but I had enough of him thinking he's some kind of relationship guru.",2020-09-20 17:33:11,287,509,0.84,37,0,7,67,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Now let's get into the meat of what happened. I was sitting on a bench at a bus stop, waiting for my bus.

My roommate was my best friend. We moved in together to leave shitty situations we were in. He’s bought me food when i didn’t have money, paid for ubers for me, i’ve done the same with him and have picked him up when we needed rides. He would tell me not to pay him back for anything because “If he had it and could help the homies, he would.”

When he moved he said he’d pay half the money for the uhaul. That half was around $50. I let him use my headphones, he lost them. He said he’d pay me back, that’s $20. 

I kept asking him for my money, and noticed he was eating my food, not properly taking care of his dog. It came to a head when he was at his girlfriends and his dog pissed and shit on our new couch. He came home, i told him i wasn’t okay with taking care of his dog anymore cuz he barely takes care of the dog himself. We ended up getting into an argument about it.

I told him nah, cuz he told me not to pay him back multiple times when he asked, and that’s his fault for spending the money if he wants to be vindictive about it now. 

He put me and my mom in a group chat (she was our co-signer for the apartment) detailing what i owed him for the bill in his name.

I am a 25 y/o ftm trans guy who lives with my 28 y/o cis boyfriend and my 2 1/2 year old son. My boyfriend and I are both bi, which will factor in later. My son is autistic.

Last fall, my grandfather unexpectedly passed away and left my grandma alone in the house they built. She had never lived by herself before and thought she wouldn't be able to do the repairs on the house by herself. None of my family wanted to help her so she asked my boyfriend and I to move in and repair the house. She offered to let us live rent free and help watch my son while we did repairs. We have a lease that clarifies all this as well.

So far we have repaired a shed, repaired a greenhouse, bought and put in a new toilet, bought and put in new pipes for the heating system, bought and put in a new stove, got the septic tank pumped plus a new septic line, got tile to redo the bathroom and kitchen floors,cleaned out the garage and my grandfather's effects, starting working on completely overhauling their second half-bath, helped get her cat put down and buried it, planning to replace the fridge, planning to replace the shower

All while working to pay for it all and taking care of a toddler with special needs.

To thank us, my grandma has been awful in return. She swears at my son and tried teaching him to call my boyfriend and I ""stupid worthless hoes"" and telling him that he is a ""stupid worthless hoe"" because he's our child. When I caught this, and asked ""why?""   she excused it by saying that ""he won't say it back because he's nonverbal so it's fine."" 

Very not fine, but we talked and I stopped letting her alone with him. Then the homophobia began. She began calling my boyfriend ""tinkerbell"" and ""Liberace"". She began making snide comments to me about ""Chaz Bono being a loser for not staying Chastity"" in reference to myself also being a trans man. Just rude little comments. 

It ended up coming to a head when she said something about how of course my son is (her words) ""r*tarded"", and that it's because I'm ""a worthless queer"".

I snapped. I reminded her that we just signed our new lease so we have 10 months left here, legally. If she wants to make them difficult, she can, but...

""...When we leave we're taking the toilet."" 

She got so mad and started asking why and saying that was elder abuse. I replied, ""if you hate people who aren't straight, why would you want a toilet bought with fag money? Get a straight person to buy your new toilet.""

My whole family is mad at me now but tbh I don't think I did anything wrong. Aita?

Edit: I thought it was pretty obvious by how ridiculous the idea of taking a toilet with someone is, but I have zero intention of actually taking the toilet. I said it sarcastically as an empty threat to demonstrate that we didn't have to move in or help but we did anyway.

Edit 2: for people not getting it, after that one incident, my grandma hasn't been around my son and we have several nanny cams anyway. He isn't in danger or being mistreated and we're moving back to the state we're from December 8th anyway.",2020-11-22 17:48:09,30,9,0.81,5,0,2,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm trying to get more established so I can stop working in the kitchen and do my own thing. I had a very good friend serve a party for me with a couple other people I know. I wasn't present at the event but prepared everything and sent the food out with the servers. I paid $150 cash per person (3 total servers) for 4 hours of work, so $37.50 an hour. I paid one person in cash the next day, then owed 2, say Joe and Ryan their money. I unfortunately don't use venmo because of some conflicts with a new phone number so ""Joe"" was going to take the $300 and send the $150 to ""Ryan"" but Joe decides since Ryan owes him $20 that I should pay Joe $170 and Ryan $130. He said he would just send him $130 and he'd never know. I refused to let that happen.

Lexi said doesn’t care if I spend time with Sarah alone, because she understands that to me Sarah is just one of the guys. I’m not at all attracted to Sarah. This weekend I hung out with Sarah at her place and got super drunk. Like the last thing I remember is barely being able to walk in a straight line to her bathroom to throw up.

Sunday morning I woke up in Sarah’s bed and she was in her living room making breakfast for herself. I was fully clothed except my shirt which always comes off when I’m drunk, and Sarah said that nothing happened between us and that she slept on the couch. 

I checked my phone I saw that before I had passed out I sent a message to Lexi telling her that I was way to messed up to drive and that I’d be spending the night there and come by to see her in the morning. She left me on read.

When I got to her place she was livid. She screamed at me and accused me of sleeping with Sarah. I told her that I couldn’t have drove drunk. She said, “I don’t give a fuck about that, you shouldn’t have spent the night with that wh*re”. She’s been at my throat since, but I don’t think I’ve done anything wrong.

Anyway, my parents decided to go on vacation with my littler brother (15 to my 25) and planned on being there the entire week of thanksgiving. Last night (thanksgiving eve), knowing i had a bunch of plans with my significant other, they texted me saying they were thinking about coming home today (thanksgiving) and having a small dinner the four of us. I had already made plans but said yes of course I’d be there. 

This morning I reached out to see what time today and they said they’d be home an a couple hours (12-1) and dinner would be 3-4. I said ok. Couple hours later mom texted me at 11:30 saying they were home I could come at 1. I said sounds great! 

An hour later (12:30) I told them I’d be there around 2:30 since my plans were taking a little longer than anticipated. Radio silence. 

At 3 I was driving to their house and got a call from my dad yelling at me about how I am pretty much an asshole and shouldn’t come. Meanwhile my 15 year old brother was sending me nasty text messages about how rude I am.

The kids have dress all smart and try sell to us. It's always nice and I try attend every year but this year my son was amongst the students. Due to covid the school was pretty strict and limited two guests per student to allow a few potential outside buyers to come as well. My son asked me to be one of them but was stuck on who to give the second space to between my wife and his mother since he wanted both to go. I told him to sleep on it and the next day he chose my wife since he'd be spending the weekend with us afterwards so it would be easier. Makes sense but his mother was not too pleased and told me to tell him that he mustn't feel obligated to take my wife only because of the weekend and ask him if he's was still sure. Wasn't comfortable with that so I said no. She can tell him herself. She was mad but accepted it.

The event was last friday evening and was rather fruitful for my son. He had three complete pieces and two of them were bought almost immediately after it started by this other outside couple which was fantastic for him. All three were amazing but one (which coincidentally was the unbought one) was just perfect for my wife's office and so we bought it. Went home, celebrated then enjoyed the rest of our weekend together. The morning after he went back to his mum, she called giving me an earful on how selfish we were for first blocking her from going and then for buying his art for ourselves and not thinking about her when she also wanted it. Apparently she wasn't aware that they would also be selling it at the exhibition. I told her that there was only one left and I wasn't going to muscle two because its better for 'outsiders' to buy the majority and not his parents. She then said that it was only fair that she buys the one we bought off us since we went to and she's now missed out (she used 'robbed') on the event itself and the opportunity to get his art. 

I kind of understand her but no. My son chose who he chose to come and we want the painting. I said she could get a printed version of it but she doesn't want that and is making a big kerfuffle over this. Aita?",2020-11-13 20:13:50,66,11,0.61,17,1,6,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She wouldn't even let people into the kitchen when she was cooking it! 

Recently my Nonna got sick and passed away, and my family has been sorting through the items in her house. My boyfriend located a drawer full of handwritten recipes and found the recipe for the pasta, with two surprising ingredients. We didn't tell the rest of my family at first because we wanted to make it first to be sure it was really the recipe. A few days later we made it and it was like Nonna was back and in my kitchen. So good!

I told my boyfriend that I thought it was a sign that we found it and that we were meant to carry on the legacy of Nonna's secret pasta. I said we should make it for my family at our next get together but still not tell anyone what the recipe was, and he agreed that would be funny.

Yesterday though I got a message from one of his friends saying that my Nonna's pasta was delicious???? I asked my boyfriend and he told me that he had posted the recipe in a groupchat. He said it casually as if he did nothing wrong!

I got angry at him and said that he knew she wanted it secret. He said that it was honoring Nonna to share her good cooking with everyone and that her memory would live on through the delicious pasta. I started yelling that it doesn't work like that and it got worse from there where he said I was overreacting and that we have no idea what she would have wanted for the recipe after her passing. He even said that if I really believed it was a sign that we found it, that HE was the one who found it and it was up to him to decide what to do with it!!! Eventually he apologized, but the damage is done.

I answered his friend and told her to please get rid of the recipe and never make it again. I asked my boyfriend if I could look through the groupchat and he was resistant but then let me. He shared the recipe with 11 people!! And after he shared it one of them responded with 👻🍝 emojis, which is so insensitive. I did make him message the chat to ask them all to please delete the recipe. I worry they won't though.

I have not told my family yet but I am going to before they find out from someone else. I am so hurt by my boyfriend's actions and it's difficult to look at him the same way. My friends all say I'm being melodramatic but this secret recipe is a big part of my Nonna's identity and casually sharing it feels SO disrespectful.",2020-09-05 16:57:43,341,1407,0.93,61,2,38,52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,

He had his mind set on a high energy dog. He doesn’t have much experience with bigger dogs or any with high energy dogs. And he’s allowed to want what he wants. Of course he is. Prior to moving in together for the first time we opted to get a dog though. And he’s only ever had a small dog, once in his life. 

I tried telling him that high energy dogs you really need o keep them active a lot throughout the day otherwise they get destructive and stray from their training. I talked him about it so many times. He assured me over and over that he gets it and bias his heart set on this breed. 

So we get the puppy and move in. She’s now 5 months old and her energy is growing with her. Which I know all about and get it. But he doesn’t. He works from home and I work out of the house. 

On my days off I encourage him to bring her out to get her energy out. But she is now afraid of the car. We live on a small block and walking hr up and down  it isn’t enough. We live near some main roads so walking her around the neighborhood isn’t an option. And we don’t have a house with a fenced in yard. 

But he’s just not doing what’s he should while he’s home for her. He won’t do what’s necessary like training her and helping her be more comfortable in the car. Because you can work over with that. She used to be but she got spooked so we need to help her get more comfortable so we can take her on long hikes and stuff. So since he’s not doing that and then she gets in the car she drools a lot and throws up and then he gets mad about it. 

Then he gets mad about how energetic she is in the house. He says he takes her out twice a day for half an hour to play but I know he doesn’t. And even that isn’t enough. She needs more stimulation. 

He lets her jump up to signal she needs to go out so now she jumps on all doors and counters. And he lets her chew on “her” towel so now she chews on all fabrics. 

Instead of helping her get her energy out the right way he just gives her a bully stick and she goes through them so quick. It’s like he’s giving her bandaids.

Every time I bring up the right way to get her energy out he gets mad at me and says I’m being critical. I try to not sound harsh and approach it nicely. But it’s true that she needs more stimulation then a bully stick and being taken out ion a leash a couple times a day, and maybe for a walk every couple of days when I have the time to do so. 

tl;dr: boyfriend doesn’t help high energy dog get her energy out productively, gets mad at the dogs behavior and then gets mad at me when I try to correct it.",2020-11-22 14:36:28,39,6,1.0,0,0,7,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
186,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jyd775/aita_for_being_rude_to_my_best_friend_after_she/,AITA for being rude to my best friend after she backed out of signing a lease,"So my best friend (of over 5 years) and I were planning for several months to live together and sign a lease starting in July, since both of our leases were going to be up. My previous apartment’s lease was up mid-July, so I definitely needed a place before then. Because of covid we weren’t able to view the apartment, but the pictures on the company’s website all looked really nice so we decided to go with it. Long story short, the apartment was nothing like any of the pictures and had water damage, so we both decide to cancel the lease.

We’re in the process of searching for an apartment in a location and price that works for us both, I find a place we agree on, until my friend refuses to sign a lease unless we can tour the apartment — understandable since we got screwed over last time, but the pics for each individual unit were online so we knew exactly what we were getting and, again, covid precautions wouldn’t allow tours.

I manage to get the landlord to show us the place, and my friend doesn’t even want to see it, claiming the rent would be “too expensive”. The rent is actually CHEAPER than the first place we planned on renting, even with electric & internet (which ends up being less than $50 after it’s split every month, despite her telling me internet alone would cost over $100). So I’m pretty pissed off because this girl has either been extremely unaware of her financial situation for months (and honestly, you’re not gonna find a place for cheaper than what I’m paying rn unless it’s in a sketchy area, so I don’t know how she can possibly afford wherever she is now), or she’s using this as an excuse to get out of living with me, because things did get a little tense between us while looking for the second place. I did ask her if she was open to taking a loan out for rent, since she said that’s what she did for her previous lease (a place that’s at least $200 more than the ones I found), and she took that as me *expecting* her to take out a loan, which was very clearly not what I said at all.

I was definitely rude at times, because it’s tiring to keep hearing excuses about why an apartment won’t work but not have her offer up any alternatives, but I never crossed a line or overreacted, just called her out on her bs. I did get argumentative about her backing out and leaving me with less than a month to find either a decent roommate or a sublease, but I don’t see why I’d be nice and friendly to someone who’s screwing me over and doesn’t feel bad about it. She sent me a sublease ad for a place saying “this would be great for you!” and maybe she was genuinely trying to help and cared, but the apartment was 1) not in a preferred area, and 2) a 3BR/1B for the price of my 2BR now in a great area. I responded that I don’t know why it would matter to her what would be great for me since she was so ready to screw me over in the first place. We haven’t talked since, except to get the security deposit from the first place back.",2020-11-21 16:06:17,16,32,0.9,5,0,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our house is currently being built, so we’re living with my parents, and during this time they refuse to let us pay for any big bills so we’re sneaking $100-$200 in whenever we can convince them to let us. 

My boyfriend wants to “save” his money and claimed he was paying for everything, mind you, he’s only making about 1000 month vs my 3400) so when I asked him how that’d work to save money when he’s hardly bringing anything in, he told me he plans too save 50% of his pay.

I then asked how he plans to help me pay for anything, he told me from now on, he’s ONLY to pay for small things (Gas, oil changes, minor car problems, little fast food trips and small purchases like basic hygiene items.) He then wants me to pay for major things (Phone bill, groceries, car insurance, and any major unexpected expense) all while claiming he pays for “everything.” 

I obviously know this isn’t the case, as I was paying half or all of most necessities and any luxuries since he is currently out of his normal job and I’m currently making triple what he is. I never bring up what he pays for, how much I paid for xxxx and how he owes me half, etc. because I don’t hold it against him but since he decided he “pays for everything” and wanted to do it this way, I agreed because I know this is false and that he’ll see how much all the “little things” add up.

It’s been 4 days since pay day, I still have about $700 left after paying for car insurance, phone bills, groceries, and my own health insurance which are all the major expenses I agreed too since he said he refuses to pay ANY THING that’s a “significant” amount. He has about $100 left after paying for gas, hygiene items, oil change, fast food, games, small items.

He said, “I only have $100, what do you have?” When I told him how much I had, he assumed I’d be paying for the rest of our gas, and small items until pay day. Here’s where I may be TA, I told him no and that I refuse to pay for anything else because he claims he already pays for everything anyway and I never help him. Since I’m only responsible for large expenses so I did my part of the plan HE made without consulting me. 

I’m more than happy to pay for a majority of things since I’m making more for now, I’m more than happy to help him save and budget but I’m not happy that he demanded we do this without ever talking to me about it and said I don’t pay for anything.

I have a nephew named ""Jack"". No point in trying to hide this fact: I'm jealous of him. I'm so jealous my blood probably runs green. The fact isn't super relevant to the post, I just wanted to acknowledge it upfront.


Four years ago, Jack's life started coming together (of course he worked hard, too, like taking overtime whenever it was available, networking, etc) and he got a nice tech hardware job. Since then, Golden Boy Jack has lived under a lucky star.


He *never* shuts up about it.


You will always hear about how great he's doing, how much money he's making, the expensive house he's going to buy, etc. If it wasn't for the bragging and the family always talking about him, I would be able to shrug and move on. Jack and I are different people who are at different life stages. He hasn't had to deal with severe mental health issues to clear his way.


He won't let you forget about how *awesome* he is. Oh, he cured his anxiety with weed. Of course, if there's something he doesn't want to do, oops! Anxiety, gotta leave. 


He chased off a car-jacker with a frying pan. He has a pretty girlfriend. He's going to buy an expensive house. He's making 10,000 a month (after Covid, it'll be a paltry 8,000). He outsmarts everyone in arguments. On, and on, and on, and *on* about his every ""cool"" action and accomplishment.


The family eats it up. Pretty sure his parents have a shrine to him somewhere in their basement. My mom and grandma adore him. I used to as well . . . until Jack turned into a braggart.


My accomplishments? If Jack is around, he starts talking about himself. It must be an automatic response by now. Otherwise, everybody shrugs off what I say. I've gone so far and worked so hard, but because I don't have the big paycheck, the cute girlfriend, the expensive house, and the big mouth to go with it, I'm a nobody.


The ""Jack is God"" thing has been going on for about four years now. It comes up any time family is discussed, and of course, when he or his parents come around, it's Jack Time. You should listen to Jack Time when Jack himself is hosting it. 


I am at my absolute limit.


This afternoon, mom and I were sitting in my office and she started talking about how Jack is making 10,000 a month. I told her that's great and I was tired of hearing about how great Jack's life is going.


I told mom that I didn't want to hear about the Golden Boy, that listening to someone be lauded day after day while you've been scrabbling for success for years gets tiring.


Mom called me a jealous asshole, told my grandma, and now grandma thinks I'm an asshole as well. I don't think I am. I've held my tongue for **FOUR** years.


Let him enjoy his luck and success, but stop making me listen to it so much. Can't he send a postcard or something like normal people?

He looked at me, nodded 'Yes' and then went right back to what they were doing before. Then after another few minutes, I looked in my rear view mirror and EVERYONE in the drive thru was looking past my truck with their heads hanging out their windows. Cars even started to beep. Then I stuck my head out the window and said, ""Cmon dude... this is getting ridiculous. Please make her move up or something.""  Then the lady pulls forward to where you get your receipt. Her order still isn't done. I hear her complaining about me yelling and then proceeds to order with 2 other Chic-fil-a employees.

She finally pulls up to the window and keeps giving them instructions on how she wants her salads, keeps adding to her order, ""I dont care whatever you charge me, I want blah blah blah.""  She pays and the employee at the window asks her to pull around to a parking spot in the front to wait for her food. The employee asked her about 5 - 10 times to move to the parking spot. Mind you, at this point, my 4 year old is in the back seat doing the pee pee dance in her car seat.  I almost got out and was gonna help her pop a squat in front of this ladys truck. She stalled so my times to spite me.

He cooked  and we ate in the living room and I sat back on the couch just to kind of relax and watch tv before I got a bit of work done and then went to bed. 

I finished eating first and would have taken the plates  to the kitchen sink but I just wanted to relax after working such a long day (my profession has me working long hours). I'm just so tired all the time. I have anxiety which hits at night so sleep is precious to me. 

Anyway, he finishes and takes his plate and his cup only to the sink, leaving my plate and cup there. 

So this is where I think I might be the asshole. I got up, taking my dishes and told him ""hey thanks for taking my plate."" 

He responded that he cooked and I was like, well I finished cleaning the kitchen after work and I take your plates to the sink every time I take mine.""

And he told me ""when?"" 

I was like ""ok"" and put my dishes back on the coffee table and went to my desk to work without talking to him. He asked me why I was mad and I told him that the polite thing to do was to take my dishes too.

He argued that I was rude when I said it and should not expect him to be my slave and that I'm an adult and should clean up after myself. I told him that i work two jobs and still take care of my chores (sometimes a little late but I'm the only one to do the bathroom or mop and deep clean). That this wasn't about the division of labor but about simple courtesy but if he wants to make it about the division of labor, let's go. I told him that with him not working, and me working two jobs and still being responsible for a good amount of house work, the division isn't fair. 

He said that while he doesn't want to compare me to his mom, his mom is still able to work full time and take care of a much bigger house basically on her own without much help from his dad. I told him I guess that's why you are the way you are and who am I to try to change 29 years of skewed gender roles and fucked up parenting in his household.


He says I'm the asshole for bringing up the fact that he doesn't work, suggesting that  he should do more when he already does a lot (he does but not close to everything in our apt.) and bringing his upbringing in this (his mom works full time, does 100% of the cleaning and cooking and did the child rearing) I say I'm not because he was the one who brought up everything and it's all true.

Obviously there are bigger issues going on but AITA in that moment?

He always snores very loud at night, and I can't sleep at all because of him. The rumbling sound is so scary, and it sounds like the house will collapse the next minute. When he sits on the couch, he often just starts snoring, and I find it annoying. We've tried medication and therapy on him, but nothing seems to stop his snoring.

Apart from that, he also eats with his bare hands. He slouches on the couch and eats everything with his bare hands, and he puts his feet up on the table in the living room. He slouches in front of the TV, and he never eats with the rest of the family. After he eats, he just puts his dirty dishes back in the cupboard without even bothering to wash it. He also touches things with his dirty, greasy hands.

The worst part about it is that my dad never brushes his teeth. After he eats dinner, he just resumes watching TV. He always has bad breath, and his teeth are all brown or yellow. His breath is intolerable, and when he talks, it smells gross. He eats several hard boiled eggs for breakfast, and he rips up a muffin into 50 tiny pieces to eat it, which I totally don't understand.

So a few days ago I told my dad that I'm fed up with his gross habits. I told him that his behavior is unacceptable, and that he is setting a terrible example for the family. Now he is giving me the silent treatment, and each time he walks past me he gives me angry stares.",2020-11-25 21:07:14,23,9,0.7,4,0,6,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I took a required fine arts english class in my final year that didn't have anything to do with my major. The prof, A, spent most of the time chatting. He would also show us videos in other languages with no subtitles. It was a strange class and it lead to almost no one taking it seriously. He then injured his hip pretty badly, and this happened on a day I was supposed to present something worth a lot of my grade. He said everyone who had to present for the rest of the year would get an A if we emailed him what we had.

My FU: I didn’t. I have no excuse other than being overloaded. He also gave no deadline, so I forgot. But I acknowledge that this all could’ve been avoided had I just emailed my project, which was done!

The course got taken over by J, who was considerably more strict. She was angry that no one took the course seriously as we were 2/3rds of the way through (ex. she spent one day just yelling at us bc a few students left early.) The curriculum was so vague that I don't think even she knew what to do, I don't blame her for being upset.

A few days before the final week, I smashed my head. I then threw up, and then promptly took myself to the doctor’s office and got sent home indefinitely.

Then, me, and four other students got an email from J, saying that since we never emailed our projects, we had to present on the last class in less than a week. I emailed back saying I’m sorry, but I had zero time to prepare, and I had a concussion: here's my doc's note and my project. To which she said no, come present (in front of a giant, bright lecture hall), or fail. 

I asked if I could present to just her over the phone, or in a dark office alone. She said no, I ""really needed to make some sort of effort” and that my letter from the doc was “clearly expired”? Two of the other students had asked to just not present and she just agreed and they passed. She dismissed that completely when I mentioned it. My friend hypothesized that she was still upset that no one took her seriously, and she didn't want everyone to get a handout, which I get. My doc wrote a second note directly to J. She still didn’t care and was rather condescending.

So I went to the head of her department with the email receipts, both of J and I's back and forth, and A's original email, my finished project and both doc's notes. The head was horrified and sent me home. I didn't present and apparently J was clearly upset I wasn't there. I'm fairly certain that she got in shit as I got a very short apology and passed. 

I was never mean to her, and I felt like I tried so hard to compromise. I've never argued with a prof about anything else.

Some friends and my mom disapprove of how I handled this. It was my fault for not just sending it right away. And I do understand the frustration J was facing, maybe this was out of character for her and I got her in shit.

194,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ibpcnx/aita_for_telling_my_friends_wife_what_his_magic/,AITA for telling my friend's wife what his Magic The Gathering collection is worth?,"So my friend Jared and I used to play a lot of trading card games when we were younger.  We mainly focused on Magic the Gathering.  As we got older we had less and less time for the game so I sold off most of my collection while Jared got into collecting cards as a hobby/investment.  He was pretty good at it too.  Having seen what his collection is up to recently I would conservatively estimate its value at about $50,000.   For those who know MTG he has several pieces of Power 9, a binder full of alpha, beta, and revised dual lands, and several binders of valuable cards from sets spanning the entire life of the game.  He also has a few boxes of unopened booster packs from old sets and a few unopened booster boxes.  

&#x200B;

Jared and I have spoken at length about his future plans with the money he hopes to make selling off his collection down the road.  This is why I was surprised to find out later that his wife Kim had no idea what those cards were worth.

&#x200B;

Kim had stopped by to pick up some things from my wife and we got to talking.  Kim was talking about how she'd like to go on a little vacation once the pandemic was over, but couldn't justify the expense.  Thinking nothing of it I joked about having Jared sell a piece of his ""retirement fund"" referencing his collection.  Kim laughed and said she couldn't see them getting much of a vacation out of a few trading cards.  I asked her what kind of vacation would she be having that would run her over 50 grand and she got confused.  Turns out Kim had always assumed the cards were worth some money, but nothing even close to their actual value since she had no knowledge of the game.  I told her his collection was worth a lot more than just a few hundred dollars and gave her my estimate based on what I'd seen before.  Kim thanked me, grabbed her things, and left.

&#x200B;

I got several angry messages from Jared the next day.  Apparently Kim had been furious with him for not telling her how much the cards were worth and was now trying to get him to sell off some cards to put toward a vacation as well as some things around the house she had been wanting for awhile but holding off because she didn't think they could afford it.   Jared told me I should have kept my mouth shut about the value of the cards and that I started a whole mess of drama that didn't need to happen.  He has since stopped responding to my messages.  It has been almost a week and from what I hear from my wife things are still pretty tense over at their house.

The lady from the driving school, who I’ll call Cindy (fake name) was trying to call my mother initially, but my mother told her that she needed to deal with me directly. I have gotten calls from them the past week, but I’ve been swamped with university work and quite frankly just don’t have the time or energy for this right now. I also work both days on the weekend. For this reason, I have ignored every single one of their calls (I might be the asshole for this, at least my dad says I am). I never ONCE spoke to ANYBODY from this company and confirmed a driving lesson and neither did my mother. 

Cindy took it upon herself to schedule me for lessons at 8 am on saturdays despite not having spoken to me ONCE. So the poor driving instructor who was just following his schedule showed up at 8 am to pick me up, but since I had work this morning, and I NEVER booked this class in the first place, I can’t go. My mom agrees it’s not my fault (but she says I should’ve picked up my phone at least), but IMO I’m well within my right to ignore their phone calls and I feel they should’ve just left me alone after the 2nd missed call so I could contact them when I had the time. Why Cindy would proceed to schedule me anyway and hope I somehow magically become aware (and was even available during this time in the first place) of the lesson is beyond me.

My dad is blaming me for this because “it’s my responsibility.” Well yeah, it IS my responsibility but how can I be expected to know about and show up to a lesson I never booked and never knew existed? Like I’ve been ignoring them for a reason. When the dentist calls to remind you you’re due for a cleaning and you don’t pick up your phone, they’re not just going to schedule you anyway and charge you the no show fee when you inevitably don’t show up. I feel for the driving instructor because he’s an innocent party in this, and I hope he still gets paid for his time, but I don’t see how this is my fault.

The people involved were all relative strangers to me but to my understanding they know each other reasonably well, at least over Discord. I said I was, I have Autism, but I don't let it interfere with myself and I have turned down accommodations at school because I do not want them, I want to succeed or fail on the same rules as everyone else, and I do not want extra time or some such because that is unfair. I was told this was ""sad, and internalized ableism"".

I bristled a bit at that and said that I am not internalizing ableism because Autism is not a disability, I do not need accommodations, and it is my own problem if I'm unable to deal with it well enough, not the school's. Someone else (who also has Autism, though I didn't know that until slightly later) said ""Autism is a disability"". I found that offensive, and said as such, to which I was told ""I find it offensive that you refuse to acknowledge it as a disability."" I made a comment about how high-functioning Autism is not the same as severe Autism, and several people immediately jumped on me and said that those terms are ""total bullshit"" and ""not real"", and that they exist only because some people wanted an excuse to keep society just so or some such. It would likely have grown more heated but the server's moderators stepped in and put a halt to it at that moment.

I ultimately stand by my feelings. I am not disabled and I am doing just fine without extra assistance, and I am frustrated by the implication that because I have Autism I *need* extra help and refusing it means I'm internally self-loathing. However I am not certain if my behavior and responses were appropriate here. I can see how both sides could be seen as in the wrong here, even if my (highly biased) feeling is that I am correct.

My husbands sister did get married last week however and since then, my fiance has wanted to switch around all of our plans because he saw them at his sisters wedding and thought they were cool.

Our original plan was to have our two sons walk our rings down the aisle and have our daughter be the flower girl. We also had plans to have his band play at the wedding, where he intended to do a few sets. We were going to have almost 150 people attending. It was going to be a pot luck. I was going to have my brothers walk me down the aisle and have my sisters be brides maids. 

Now, since attending her wedding, he has decided that he wants our dog to walk the rings down the aisle because that is what his sister did and he thought it was awesome. He wants to rent a DJ, instead of have his band play because he liked the music played at his sisters wedding. He wants to cut back our guests from 150 to around 60 people instead because his sisters wedding was ""small and perfect"". He also wants to change our pot luck idea to a full caterer service because the food at his sisters wedding was ""delicious"". Now he doesnt want my brothers walking down the aisle because its ""too much"" (theres 4 of them).

All of this shit will not only cost us more money in the long run but.. this is not his sisters fucking wedding and I dont want to change shit around simply because he enjoyed himself at her wedding and thinks ours should be practically the same as hers. Hes mad at me saying that this is his wedding too and that I am ""cutting him out"". When in all actuality he was the one who made most of the plans for our original wedding idea and decided to switch it up simply after seeing his sisters wedding.

I then replied ""I'll do whatever the fuck I want"" and walked off before she could say anything.

I heard her say ""what did you say!?"" As I was walking off and next thing I know she got up and left the house to go to her appartment.

Mom in the middle and son-in-Law suddenly starts treating me like poo on his shoe,"I recently was a guest of my eldest daughter (43 - hereinafter referred to as ED) - she got my plane ticket, and covered all of my eating-out expenses - after she invited me and I told her I had no traveling money - she was very insistent I come. After I consented to come, ED - despite my very known concerns about COVID (my lungs are compromised due to having survived hantavirus) - planned herself a fairly elaborate, maskless, afternoon birthday party for the day after I arrived (ED's actual birthday). ED and I drove over to Youngest daughter's (YD) house to surprise the grandbabies with ""Auntie's surprise birthday present"" - me. The grands were delighted, and asked if I could stay the night with them. I checked with ED who said she was okay with it. YD & I prepared a impromptu birthday celebration of ED's favorite Mom meal (literally hours of cooking) cupcakes, candles, etc. Afterwards, YD REMINDED ED she had a tattoo appointment day of the party (that had been scheduled 3 months prior) and that she would likely be late for ED's party, but would show up with bells on. ED acknowledged, stating perhaps YD's hubby & kids could come to the party on time, and YD could join later. YD acknowledged this as an idea. YD thought the party was at 2, it actually started at 1. Day of, I  accompanied YD to her appointment, and we impulsively got mother-daughter tats (very simple, about 15 mins each), thinking we'd still be only a little bit late to the party. Appointment ran WAY over expected time (11 - 2:30). About 2:15, YD's hubby got a PO'ed phone call from ED, asking why he wasn't there with the kids yet. Then YD got a nasty call from ED, too. YD's hubby gathered kids and ran to the party, YD & I went to her house to gather my luggage and phone and ran for the party. YD's hubby got lost on his way there, & YD & I ended up getting there before him. YD & I apologize profusely for being late, and YD for the time of the party mix-up on her part. ED was cold & distant to us all, including neices and nephew, throughout the party. She was also very distant towards me throughout the rest of my visit. ED's hubby, who has always been warm and very jokey with me, made several kind of mean comments at me throughout my visit; but I just treated them as jokey. I did ask him several times if he was angry with me throughout the week; but he never fully answered, said 'I'm angry at everyone!' , no more than that. But the last full day of my visit, he was especially nasty to me: ED asked him to pick up a pack of smokes for me while he was out, when she pointed out they were the wrong ones when he got back with them, he remarked 'maybe they'll kill her faster' which resulted in my spending the last day intermittently crying. It broke my heart! I was always so happy to spend time with them both prior to this. I don't understand - AITA?

I (19F) live with my (19M) husband and another married couple (F32, M43) and we share a flat. When they moved in, there was no baby and they knew we smoked, they told us it was fine as they also smoked. They were also fine with our 2 cats so we thought, perfect. We can smoke without bothering our flatmates and they may even come and join us whenever they’re feeling it. Let’s call the wife Martina and the husband Jacob. Few months later, Martina told us she was pregnant and that she found out last month, but that she was too afraid to tell us because she was scared we’d move out. We did not want to live with a baby. We felt forced to accept it as we were in a tough situation. (Lockdown coming) From then on, our lives became harder. She would tell us we couldn’t smoke anymore in the house and that we would have to go out if we wanted to smoke. Overtime she told us we couldn’t have a cat litter box in the bathroom anymore as she is “sensitive” to smell (cat litter was cleaned every single day) so now we have the cat litter in our bedroom. I would hear her shouting and go to the living room to see one of my cats being scolded for sleeping in one of her baby beds in the living room. My cats were not free to do what they wanted anymore. Now the baby was born about two weeks ago. Since this, she’s been telling me to put my cats in my bedroom so that they are far away from the baby because he could inhale cat hairs. And we can only let them out when the baby isn’t in the living room. Today, we had our friend Cathy over. Martina and Jacob left the house with the baby and said they would be back later on. We started smoking in the living room. The cats were out playing. Martina and Jacob seem came home quite early. As we are smoking, she comes into the living room with the baby, seeing that we are clearly smoking and continues to do stuff in the kitchen before returning to her room. We finish up, and go to my room to chill there with my friend. I leave cats in the living room. Then I heard crying I went there to see if she took the baby back there when we had just smoked there. She sits there looking displeased with me as I walk in. Then she tells me to put the cats back in my bedroom as the baby is now there. She grabs all the cats toys aswell and shoves them in my bedroom. 
Good to keep in mind that her husband smokes cigarettes every 20 minutes or so 
and sometimes sneaks in to join us in smoking weed. She never tells him anything about him smoking.

Me- “you were out and said you’d be back later.”
M- “i had to go through living room with my baby, it’s horrible”

He has been furloughed since March/April, but we were basically evening out Money wise before then. He pays for our housing bills, I take care of anything else, because I get paid in dollars so it’s easier that way. When covid hit my business also was non-existent (so instead of getting paid 80% I was getting paid 0) so I had to use my cc, and have now gotten $7k in debt to have food in the house, etc. 

At the beginning of furlough he slowly got back into his gaming habit that he has pretty much abandoned since he was in his early twenties. To my belief, this was behind him when we first started dating so it was never an issue with us. A few months in it has become a huge part of his life again. 

I grew up with brothers so I understand the gaming life, but it was always when there was extra time, etc. it has now gotten to the point that we are working around his gaming schedule. It started off to where we couldn’t go to quiz nights because it was the same nights that he had his games set up. Of course since lockdown happened that hasn’t been an issue, but yesterday was thanksgiving and being away from my family on a family holiday is already hard, but he had to play his games all night because “he already committed to it”. I’m to the point now that I want him to just stop playing games in total but I know that is harsh. I know this is a tough time for him too being furloughed and not being social, but I’m just feeling like he could use this extra time to do something lucrative and maybe helping me get out of the $7k debt that we got into while I wasn’t working. I’m back to work now and working to bring that number down but it’s very annoying working from home and watching him just game ALL DAY!",2020-11-27 21:35:36,16,9,0.92,1,1,3,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
