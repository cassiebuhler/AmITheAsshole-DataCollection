It was much lesser paid, more tiring and longer hours but beggars can't be choosers, I have 3 kids to raise and need a job or it would be too much for my husband to shoulder. I was going to continue to work there until I find a more suitable job because the boss of that company is quite an asshole.

Some time ago my niece(19F) was looking for a part-job and since there were vacancy in my workplace I recommended her to my superiors. My brother's family is quite wealthy, fully funding my niece's studies and living expenses and my niece only wanted a job for extra allowance. 

My niece soon found out that many of us working there are not paid the standard for over-time and our workload exceeding the norm. She was disgusted by the environment and wanted to file complaint about the company to the authorities. I begged her not to, not because of my love for the company(I was going to leave eventually), but because like me, many of us there have families to feed and needed the job.

My niece ignored me and ended up making quite a big deal out of it, posting pictures, videos and long paragraphs on social media and file some reports to ""fight for our rights"". I have no idea if it changed anything in the company. However, as a result of this drama, the company decided to dismiss a portion of its staffs, and including me, a few other coworkers of mine had lost their jobs. They did not voice it out directly but they have been avoiding me, probably blaming me for introducing my niece to the job.

I have been avoiding my niece too because, despite her good intentions, I still lost my job. My niece had been texting me giving all sorts of reasons that what she done was for what is right. When I ignored her texts, she sent more with long paragraphs basically wanting me to acknowledge that she is right. I really don't want to put blame or argue with a someone half my age still living in comfort with her parents, so in the end I replied ""I just hope that you are proud of yourself.""

My brother texted me later saying that I was being unkind to his daughter, that as her aunt who witnessed workplace toxicity with her I should encourage her to continue to fight for what is right(still going on between her and the company).

Unfortunately my adoption didn't work out and I grew up in foster care until I turned 18.

I'm now 19 and in college. 

In February, I got a Facebook message from a man claiming to be my father. We messaged back and forth and while I kept a lot of my childhood details private, we did make plans to meet him and my mother. They weren't married to each other by the way.

When I got to the restaurant, I was very shocked and honestly upset to find my father and mother had brought their spouses, as well as their children to surprise me. My father's mother, so my grandmother was also there.

I was already feeling very emotional about the whole thing and seeing everyone there didn't help.

So I sat through an hour of listening to them sharing all about their lives while I fake smiled through everything. Honestly, I felt very jealous that they had kids they really loved and how they all had really happy lives after ditching me.

Then they started asking about me and my parents, and how my Facebook gave very little away about my life.

I basically lost it and started crying like a little bitch (lol) and told them how shitty my adoptive parents were and how shitty foster life was. 

I was pretty snarky and sarcastic when I said  that I'm glad their lives worked out for them because mine sure as hell didn't.

I couldn't stop crying and my father had to drop me back home. He was very apologetic.

I feel very shitty about it. I made my mother and father cry at the restaurant. They were really nice people. 

I got a few messages from my mother and father separately where they've been apologizing and if they could make it up to me.

My mother in particular seems really upset by everything and I hate that I may have messed up her happy life. Her last message basically said that she's been unable to sleep and wants to see me again.

I've been ignoring their messages and just been focusing on school instead.

I (28f) have been dating SO(26m) for about five years now. Got married once we both finished grad school last year, had all our friends at our wedding (pre covid) and have been floating on that honeymoon glow for a while now. 

We‚Äôve always talked about having kids, but we have very different perceptions on the process of pregnancy.

Simply put, SO is TERRIFIED. When he was a new college student (like 18/19, so before I knew him) he had a horrible experience with kidney stones. No one in his family ever had one, and as a new student in a new place, he took it really bad. 

He spent a few nights in the hospital alone - his parents, now empty nesters, had flown overseas for a vacation and couldn‚Äôt get to the hospital (they still are incredibly apologetic to this day). 

He spent the first week of college in the hospital, hooked up to all kinds of pain meds and chugging water and sports drinks, all while convulsing and writhing in pain.

I guess this is a common saying, but apparently every nurse and doctor told him that passing a kidney stone was similar to giving birth. I guess being drugged up, loopy, and absolutely miserable in pain really worked that into his mind, and he has since been terrified of putting someone through that pain. 

We‚Äôve talked about having children before, especially now that we‚Äôve married, but he‚Äôs always been more inclined towards adoption. He doesn‚Äôt want me to go through the ‚Äúmind shattering pain‚Äù of childbirth.

I disagree. My mother told me that her pregnancy to me was amazing. She felt an incredible bond with her unborn child, and said that pain didn‚Äôt factor in at all during the moment - she was just so happy that I came out alright. And, if the pain really was an issue, there are many other options that help the birthing process go smooth. 

I‚Äôve explained this to my SO, and he was worried. Almost in tears, he explained that he couldn‚Äôt live with himself if he caused me to go through so much pain. I told him I would never hold something like that against him - having a child is of course a 50/50 decision. If I was worried about the pain I wouldn‚Äôt do it, but I‚Äôm not. He kinda shut down a bit, and said okay. We haven‚Äôt talked about children since.

Mom immediately filed for divorce. He went on to marry the other woman. My dad didn't have much custody of me when I was little. He was a nice and tried really hard but my mom was my primary custodian and there is nothing that I wouldn't do for her. I guess the fact that he always disrespects my mom, acts like she is the reason he cheated just made me hate him. My mother also strictly told my father that I am not to have any contact with his wife/child.

This happened when I was 5. I am now 20. Right now, I don't have any family except for my father, with whom I have cut all contact with (he didn't come to my mom's funeral and that was the last straw for me). Few months ago, my father's daughter, Tracy, contacted me. Turns out that she has lost both her parents to the pandemic. She was about to go into foster care and begged me to help her. 

I told her very politely that I do not want to have any contact with her and that she cannot possible expect me to take care of her when I am just a broke college student. She told me that she had plans and she would work and all I have to do is not let her go into foster home (she told me that she will take care of herself). She asked me to help her as I am her sister. As I mentioned, I have no clue about this person. I don't even know if what she was suggesting was legally possible. 

In the end, I told her that I wasn't in any position to help her and I don't know her. I told her that while we do have the same father, I don't consider him to be my father and I don't consider her to be my sister. I wished her luck but also firmly told her that I do not wish to have any contact with her. After that I ignored any attempt she made to contact me. 

She has recently started trying to contact me again. I had some glimpse at the messages and she alternates between calling me monster/heartless to how awful her foster home is. I haven't responded.

Me and my wife wrote her a song/rhyme, and its something very special to us. My wife passed away during childbirth, and so the song is something me and my daughter use to feel a lot closer to her. 

Three years ago I met a woman, who I am now engaged to. She's a wonderful woman, and seven months ago we decided we'd try for a baby (after discussing it with my daughter). She's now five months pregnant and we are having twins. 

She initially asked about a song for them, (she's heard me sing my daughter's song a lot), and I told her that I wouldn't because it was mine and my daughters thing, to be connected to her mother. She understood, but her family is still extremely upset about it. 

They were originally the ones who told my wife to ask about a song, and have not stopped badgering me about it. Continually telling me I'll have my twins growing up thinking they're unloved and that I love my daughter more than them, and that it's clear who my favourite child is. 

I think they're overreacting and don't think it will be that big of a thing. Plus, I wasn't even the one who wrote most of the song. I just sing it. 

My fiance is also concerned, and has asked me to not sing the song where the twins would hear, which I understand - but she doesn't want me to sing it if they're in the house at all, which I don't think is fair to my daughter. 

I don't think I'm the asshole. My fiance thinks she's being fair. Her family think I'm evil, and they're in the right.

We decided to try a ‚Äúpod school‚Äù just for the sake of getting over this hump. 

It basically means they‚Äôre each in a class of five (my kid plus four of their peers.) 

We selected the other kids in the pod pretty carefully because we wanted the kids to have productive classmates who were there to learn. It worked out well. 

Then the pod schooling turned out to work significantly better than public schooling. They got twice the work done in half the time. They were actually enjoying their studies for once. 

So all the parents in the pod banded together and came up with the money to hire a permanent teacher in conjunction with a couple stay at home moms, and we unenrolled our kids from the public school. 

Our local public school isn‚Äôt that big, so it turns out that by removing so many of their top students (read: top standardized test takers), their budget has actually been noticeably impacted as well as their ranking in the district. 

The school has reached out and asked us to disband our pod so they can get the students back (and the teacher we hired) saying it is impacting students who remain at the school and the best students are now beginning to leave for their own pod structures, taking the better teachers with them. 

I‚Äôm kind of a community leader, I‚Äôve got considerable sway over the community, so I‚Äôve been asked to try and squash the pod trend, put my kids back in school, and stop this thing before it gets going any further. 

I really want my kids to get the best education they can, but I do have serious pause over doing so at the expense of the rest of the kids in town.

It was not something that I ever thought would happen. She left behind 3 children, 8M, 4F and 1F.

My husband and I were written to be her children‚Äôs godparents. We have never wanted children of our own and do not have any, but we accepted the role of being godparents because we figured that it‚Äôs just a formality. Plus my best friend did not have many other people she could rely on. 

When she passed, her children were left without a mom or dad. The courts appointed her brother to be their guardian but he struggled a lot because he already had three children of his own to care for. After some time, he called me and said that he was going to transfer legal guardianship of the children to me per my best friend‚Äôs wishes.

I told him I wasn‚Äôt sure if I should or could be a parent to them. He said I should give it a try for a little while and see if it‚Äôs fine. He said my husband and I could probably provide a better home for them than he could at the moment. I was already very close to the children at that point so I agreed. 

My husband was not as close to them and was reluctant at first, he said he wasn‚Äôt sure if he could deal with the household size doubling overnight. Eventually he agreed to try it out.

The issue is that in the months since we‚Äôve taken care of the kids, I have developed a strong bond with them but my husband has not. I never thought in my entire life that I would want children, and I still am not completely sure if I‚Äôd ever want biological children of my own, but I know that I want to keep being a parent to these kids specifically and that I‚Äôd be heartbroken if they left. 

My husband has more or less tried his best to deal with them but it‚Äôs just not working for him. He sees children as a chore and hasn‚Äôt developed a strong emotional connection with them like I have. When my best friend‚Äôs brother asked if he should start the paperwork to make me the official guardian, I had to give him a rain check. 

I want the children. My husband does not. He said he‚Äôs willing to take care of them on weekends or something but not be their permanent guardian. He said keeping the children would violate a pretty big part of our marriage, considering he has never wanted children and has even got a vasectomy to prevent them. 

I am torn. I love these children but I cannot think about sacrificing my husband either.",2020-11-19 10:43:01,561,3353,0.97,25,131,16,9,2,3,1,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She didn't go to college so she just moved nearby to my university and we have stayed together. We currently live together.

Her mom has breast cancer and at most has a year left. I've tried supporting my girlfriend in her grieving process in whatever ways I can. When she went to go see her mother the other day, her mom said she was sad that she would never see us get married.

My GF came home and said we should get married I was like ""Are you proposing or something"" and she said no but she wants me to propose to her in the next few days.

It wasn't really a discussion more like ""this is what we're doing"". I don't feel ready for marriage, not in terms of our relationship, we've been together for nine years. But I'm 27, I know some people can get married at 27 but I want to be at least 30. I'm usually pretty chill with letting her make the big decisions but I just don't feel ready for marriage.

I was talking to one of my friends on facetime and his girlfriend chimed in and told me just to tell her how I feel, she may be upset but she would understand(She knows my GF). So Last night I told her how I'm not ready for marriage. I suggested other things like maybe a ""fake wedding"" where we don't actually sign the papers or maybe we could just have a big party for our 10th anniversary (Next month).

She got mad and told me it wouldn't change anything, it was just a dumb piece of paper. But it's more than that to me. First of all I want to have a nice wedding, not crazy or anything but decent which we have nowhere near the money for right now. Like where we are financially right now we would have to choose between a venue and crappy food or a backyard and a honeymoon at the local holiday inn. And also there's such a societal pressure when you get married to do things like have kids or something like that which I am nowhere near ready for.

My girlfriends really mad and she claims it's about her mother which it very much is not. It's about me. She told me to give her some space so I'm staying with my twin sister right now. But AITA here?

Edit: I 100% will marry her and I could never see myself with anyone else. But I just can't see myself getting married now. We have spoken about marriage and we've always said we wanted to be in our 30's, this came out of nowhere.

I don't work very often with Rebecca but I'm depending on her for approval on a long-term project, so I went into her office to ask her for a timeline, since she's back (she's been back four weeks). Instead of talking to me about the project, she started showing me baby pictures.

I kept saying ""Hey so about the project"" and ""That's great, I'm so happy for you, but can we get back to the project?"" and stuff like that. She just kept shoving pictures of her kid at me. Eventually someone else came in and the whole thing started up again.

Finally done with the dog and pony show, I stood up and said ""Hey Rebecca, I'm kind of waiting on you for final approval on this marketing push. Can we please get back to work?""

She started to fucking cry and ran out of the office yelling about how I'm so mean and how hard it is to be away from her baby and can I please just give her a break. I'm just stood there like... what the fuck dude. The woman who came in and interrupted us is glaring at me all meanly and said ""Wow, I bet you're real proud of yourself.""

I was just like ""I'm here to get my job done, not look at picture's of someone's kid.""

So buckle up. 7 years ago, my husband passed away. Few months after he passed away, a 15 year old teenager came to my house. 

She revealed that she was his daughter. His name isn't in her birth certificate but he really stepped up after he found that her mom died when she was 10. She went to live with her grandmother and my husband paid her grandmother each month to help with the expenses. 

After my husband died, the payments stopped and her grandmother threw her out. After being homeless for a couple of weeks, she came to my house. 

This was a pretty big shock to me and I cannot stress how much I didn't want this person in my house. At the same time, I couldn't leave a child homeless. So I told her that I would help her and give her a place to stay. I also warned her that I only want to help her out and that I am not taking any maternal role and she shouldn't expect me to. She agreed. 

She stayed at my house from the years of 15-18. My kid had already gone off to college and I didn't mind. I never acted on the resentment I felt but at the same time I refused to do anything that could be considered ""parent-like"". (I pretty much only provided her with food and gave her a place to stay. That's it.) 

She left when she was 18. I didn't have any contact with her after she left. She is now 20 and she contacted me recently. She wanted to connect and she told me that I am the only mother figure she has. She wanted to bond with me and she wanted me to consider her a daughter to me. 

After some contemplation, I reminded her that it wasn't a role I was willing to take and that it was something I warned about very early on. I helped her because she needed it, not because I loved her. She cried and told me that it wasn't fair and I wasn't giving her a chance. The thing is I don't think I have to.( I have tried refusing politely but she keeps pushing this and I am about to block her everywhere. )

From our marriage I gained two daughters, Jenny (age30), and Cassie (aged 27).

My wife and I were not a great couple. We got married way too young, and grew apart. She became more religious as we got older, and I became less religious. She also was always angry at me for something or the other. My political beliefs shifted to be more liberal, and my wife became  more conservative. We did our best to not fight in front of the kids, but our arguments were loud, and could be heard through the walls.

Twelve years ago, I found out Maggie was having an affair. Jenny was 17, and going to college soon, while Cassie was still in high school. Maggie‚Äôs family had set up a trust fund for the girl‚Äôs education, and Maggie and I kept separate finances so the money part of the divorce was easy. Custody of Cassie was a fight, and my ex-wife claimed I was abusive.

 Because our fights were noisy, the girls believed her, and over the next year cut me off.  My attorney told me that because of the girls ages, the Courts wouldn‚Äôt force visitation I kept the lines of communication open, but they cut me out of their lives. I was heartbroken. I sank into a depression. Over time I rationalized that the girls were adults, and that I had done my duty to them.

My sister has a relationship with them, and through her, I have learned that both of them got married, and that Jessica had two children. I‚Äôve heard that their relationship is strained with their mother as she hated their husbands, and refused to attend Cassie‚Äôs wedding.

She that does not care but she thinks it‚Äôd be weird for the children that come out of her body to not her her last name. 

I told her that this is really important to me and that it felt like if the children didn‚Äôt have my name, it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre less connected to me. She asked if she wasn‚Äôt as connected to me because she doesn‚Äôt have my last name. I said that she couldn‚Äôt understand what I feel. Because really she can‚Äôt. This is gonna sound dumb but when a woman has a kid, they carry the child and birth them. I feel like the only way I can have level of connection between a mother and her child do with my child is if I give them my last name. Again I know it‚Äôs stupid but its how I feel.

I told Dana all of this and she got upset with me. She said that it‚Äôs disgusting that I felt like the children weren‚Äôt mine if they didn‚Äôt have my last name, which isn‚Äôt at all what I said. We argued for a little bit and we never resolved this.

&#x200B;

I'm about to buy a new flat. I'm putting all the money I have into it, and a large portion is inheritance from my recently late dad - so this is very important to me, and/because it was to him.

I've been with my girlfriend for a year, and we've talked about moving in together soon (although we're in no rush). However, my dad wanted me to (and I think it is a good idea) have whoever moved in sign an agreement to say that I own the house 100% and that they can't claim a stake in the house. This wouldn't have just applied to my current girlfriend, he wanted (and I agree) me to do it if I moved in with a friend, a spouse or even just some random.

This makes my girlfriend feel uncomfortable - she thinks I'm accusing her of being in it for the money, which I am absolutely not, and I have tried to make clear to her. She is concerned about my ability to kick her out on the street at a moment's notice, even though I've told her I wouldn't do that - but obviously my claim that I won't do that is the same as her claim that she wouldn't try to take half the house. I'm looking into making it more secure for her in this signed agreement, but signing anything would make her feel uncomfortable.

I think she is worried about the idea of me being her 'landlord', even though I've made it explicitly clear that I wouldn't accept rent from her (which she agrees with).

Also, supplementary AITA - she's mentioned that she might not be comfortable living in a house that I own at all. Would I be an ass if I refused to move to rent in the same city just because she doesn't want to live in my flat? Renting would cost more than my mortgage and obviously the money wouldn't go anywhere.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - I own flat. Want GF to move in. Want her to sign agreement saying I own the flat and she has no interest in it (not uncommon in the UK). AITA?

Additional TL;DR - Would I BTA if I refused to rent in the same city because she doesn't want to live in my owned flat?",2020-11-22 09:21:12,435,830,0.95,6,38,98,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Custody between my parents was 50:50 until last year when I (16f now) decided I wanted to live solely with my dad. The reason I made the choice was my moms husband. It's the same reason my brother has very minimal contact with my mom today (he's 20m). My mom wants to know why I chose to see her and her husband so little. Would I be the asshole to say he's the reason?

Long version: My parents divorced when I was 2 and my mom met her husband when I was 5 and my brother was 9. He was alright at first and then, once he and my mom got married, he become this really overbearing and jealous person who competed with our dad for the title of dad. He asked us twice to call him dad. The day after the wedding and then four years later on his birthday. Both times he got upset when we said no. The few times I talked about something I did with my dad he would jump in to suggest we should do it together which made me not want to talk about it. Other times, like one year Father's Day was coming up, and my brother gave me some money so we could buy our dad a gift. Our mom and her husband were asking what we were buying and my brother told them and things got awkward, her husband walked off and she asked if we were getting two father's day gifts or just the one. My brother asked her why it was important and she said she was just curious. Later that day we got back and my mom's husband said it hurt his feelings that we would buy a gift for our dad when we were with him.

There was one year my school had this dumb father daughter dance. My dad and I both agreed it was dumb and we decided to go see a movie, grab some food and make a fun night out of it instead of the dance. My mom's husband had asked me to go with him before and I turned him down, and then he was hurt that instead of going to the dance with him, I chose to skip the dance with my dad.

We had numerous things like that over the years. It drove my brother far away and he doesn't really speak to our mom anymore and has not seen either of them since he moved out for college. I moved in with my dad but never told my mom why. Mostly because I know she will take his side. Now she's asking for total honesty.

We‚Äôre both 23, I just started a job recently and my girlfriend does Youtube full time as her job. I won‚Äôt say too much, but she has around 1.5 million subscribers and she plays games on her channel. Her income mostly depends on how many views she gets and how many people donate money when she streams.

So the other day she was talking about a creepy guy in her comments begging her on a date and I jokingly said ‚ÄúWell, did you tell him that you‚Äôll sick your boyfriend on him?‚Äù

She sort of laughed and said, ‚ÄúNo, my YouTube personality always remains single.‚Äù

I had never heard this before, so after asking her about it I basically learned that her entire following doesn‚Äôt know she has a boyfriend and she‚Äôs never even mentioned me. Now, I know this isn‚Äôt a matter of privacy because she‚Äôs talked about her friends in detail on her channel before.

Honestly, I‚Äôm a little offended. I didn‚Äôt know she was doing this and thought that her subscribers were at least aware of me. We got into an argument about it and while I know she makes her money from this, I feel like she hid from me that her Internet personality is always single.

Edit:

So we had a discussion about it. I told her it bothered me that she hadn‚Äôt told me about this earlier and she admitted she had kept it hush for a while because it was a straining thing in her last relationship too.

AITA /WIBTA for not wanting to follow these new rules given by my kids‚Äô teacher and complaining to the principal?

I have 4 year old twins in preschool. It is a small school so there is only one preschool class and they are in it together. 


They are not identical twins but they look similar and people get them confused. 


We got an email from school telling us the twins can no longer wear matching masks and clothes.


Getting dressed and masked is a battle for us. We found that they did better when we let them choose. They don‚Äôt always choose to match hut sometimes they like to. 


Since getting that email, I‚Äôve been telling them not to match but the other day they were being difficult and I had a migraine so I didn‚Äôt say anything when they wore the same outfit and mask. 


I got a note sent home saying next time the boys are matching, one will be changed in to their spare outfit. They took one of the masks away and gave them a school one to wear‚Äîwhich my boys hate because they are thick and don‚Äôt have adjustable straps. 


They were very upset about having one of the masks taken away. 


I haven‚Äôt responded to the note but I‚Äôm honestly thinking of emailing the principal and saying this is getting ridiculous. Why does it matter what they wear? Put a name tag on them, realize they have different hair cuts, and heights, and shapes, AND they have different colored shoes that they wear every single day with their first initial on the back to signify who is who.

So when it came time to ordering a ring, he did the most him thing that he could do. He proposed to me with a empty box and a sticky note that had the address to a high end store. He told me he wanted me to design my ring. Due to the virus, we had to do it online instead of in store. He gave me a budget and told me to get what I want. I offered to pay for part, he said no. 

So I designed the dream ring I wanted. The problem is, it‚Äôs a grand over budget (barely, it‚Äôs like $789). My dad had given me a large check for my birthday because my fianc√© and I had both been laid off for covid, and while he got a new job, I have been struggling to find a job in my field.

I was struggling to design a ring without having professional help and my fianc√© didn‚Äôt want to help. Certain stones can‚Äôt go with certain bands and yada yada.

My parents and I have never had a great relationship. I had very few friends when I was younger as they were so possessive and picky when it came to what kids I was allowed to interact with. I wasn't allowed to have any say in how I looked either. I had always been jealous of people with long hair but because my parents thought that it wasn't ""manly"" I was stuck with a buzz cut. I was judged about everything from the way I looked, how I acted, what my interests were etc. My sister also had to deal with this, though not to the extent I had to as she was their first born (the child they'd planned).

This all led to me leaving home when I was 16. Ten years on I am living with my soon to be husband and our 4 year old son and everything seems to be going absolutely great. We had planned to have our wedding next summer but we might have to postpone it due to the pandemic.

In the past 3/4 years my parents have been trying to worm their way back into my life. My sister has forgiven them and they appear to be pretty good with her children but I haven't forgiven them.  I do not want them anywhere near my child. They had asked to video call my son a couple months ago but I opted out last minute. Our son has been going through a phase where his favourite colour changes a lot. Currently his favourite colour is pink. He has been wearing a lot of pink t shirts because of this.  I know my parents will see this as feminine and I don't want this little 4 year old boy having to listen to all the stuff I had to deal with.

They have been more persistent lately about meeting their grandson which I have tried to avoid talking about. Eventually I asked them why they cared so much about meeting my son now (they didn't even make this much effort when we first brought him home) and they said that they'd like to meet their grandson before the wedding, so he didn't think they were strangers. They want to bond with him before the big day. But they aren't invited. I don't want them there. 

We're not having a big wedding and I am not willing to cut people I genuinely care about out of the guest list so my parents can take their place. Besides, my fiance and I aren't really sure we want them around our family. I told them as much and when they argued back, I snapped that I'd rather call the wedding off than have them there. 

However, I learned later that my sister has apparently been giving them false hope that they can come to the wedding, they even picked out their outfits for it. I'd been under the impression that they'd just invited themselves but I feel like my sister just assumed I'd invite them and told them as much. They looked absolutely devastated when I snapped at them. 

They could've been guilt tripping me into inviting them. Or they could have genuinely changed and I snapped at them for being given false hope. AITA here?",2020-11-21 19:38:14,173,2299,0.97,4,8,68,3,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We're both excited, but I think my wife sometimes goes overboard and beyond what's normal. I hate to use the word pretentious, but a lot of what she does and says seems that way. Sometimes it seems like she thinks she's the only woman ever to have a baby, and that makes this experience a lot less enjoyable. The amount of pressure she puts on us and the significance she attaches to everything sucks the joy out of being an expectant parent. It also makes her hard to be around sometimes because of how demanding she can be and how nothing every seems to be good enough for her.

I did try talking to her about everting I've mentioned, but it did no good. She just didn't understand what I was trying to say. I don't know if she was being willfully ignorant or honestly didn't understand it, but I tried several different ways.  I finally told her that she needed to lighten up and learn not to make everything so difficult because it's not rocket science and many woman have had and raised babies successfully without making it this hard.

She didn't like that I told her this, but I think she needed to hear it. Ordinarily I'd listen if she told me I was the asshole, but lately her judgment has been off so I think she's wrong in this case. AITA?

Adding examples:

Planning the nursery has been awful. She never listens to my suggestions and dismisses my ideas as dumb, yet she can never decided what she wants. I've already painted the nursery twice. I tell her that the color doesn't matter, but she believes it does. She seems to get easily hung up on details like that such as paint color and carpeting. 

We did a maternity shoot, and nothing was right. The session was supposed to take 1-2 hours. Instead it took three because of how many reshoots she had us do. 

She never takes advice or input from others. I will send her an article or point out something to her, and she'll dismiss it because ""a mother knows.""

She says a lot of things which make it clear she doesn't believe I am really doing anything important. I know I have a support role, but she makes it clear exactly how little she thinks I matter in this all. That sort of leads into another issue which is how she tends to make a lot of underhanded insults about how I don't understand anything because I am the dad.

Today he said it and I said, ""stop telling her that she is making you sad, you are an adult who understands the situation. You telling her that she is making you sad is NOT fair. She doesn't understand why you have been away so long, and will be happy to see you when you get home.""

He got real quiet and I tried to re-explain, but he just said his goodbyes and hung up.

B is very much a Daddy's girl and when he is home she is all about Dada and not so much Mama. I just don't think it's fair for him to project those feelings onto her.

Her labor was difficult, so she asked my wife to come and help her for a week or two while she recovered. 

A bit of background about us. My wife and I have three kids of our own, and she is a stay at home mom. A lot of things around the house fall on her, but that doesn't mean I don't know how to do everything she does or take care of our kids. I can if I need to do it because I had to do it all by myself, with the exception of taking care of the kids, when I lived alone. 

My wife was very nervous about going away for so long. Partly it was because she'd never been away from our kids for so long, but she also worried about how I would do alone with our kids for a week or two. I had no concerns, but she seemed to think I would be helpless and couldn't manage alone. She kept asking me if we would be alright even as she was leaving. 

Honestly I was pretty offended. I consider myself extremely independent and capable. I also had no idea she thought I was so incompetent and unable to manage without her, like I am just another one of the kids even though I clean up after myself and handle most of my personal needs. I decided that I would double my efforts while she was gone to show her that I can manage everything fine by myself. 

The kids had a great time and were telling their mom how much they enjoyed our week and a half and how much they wished things were always like this. The house looked great and was spotless from top to bottom. I even managed to find time to get a few projects done around the house.

24,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jx31nu/aita_for_splitting_my_will_unequally/,AITA for splitting my will unequally?,"Throwaway for normal reasons blah blah blah.

My wife (60F) and I (61 M) have four children: lets call the Matt (35 M), Mary (35 F), Paul (32 M) and Jake (30M). We also have 7 grandchildren ranging in age from 10-2 (Matt has 1 kid, Paul has 2 kids, Jake has 4) . Even though my wife and I are both fairly healthy, in light of the current world situation we decided to update our will. Initially we just wanted to split everything equally between all of our descendants, but recently we've been talking about doing something a little different.

The first major change is that we want to leave the majority to our grandchildren. Our children are all grown and established but the future is uncertain for young people these days so we want to help our grandbabies have the best foot forward. We plan to leave about 70% of everything to be split equally for our grandchildren, put into individual trusts that they can access when they're 18.

Now here's the tricky part (sorry if this is long): Our relationships with our children are not equal, and so we do not think their stake in our will should be either. Our relationship with Matt is very strained. We try to reach out to him at least once a month but he barely makes an effort back. He sees us maybe twice a year even though he lives closest to us (about 30 mins). On the other hand we are very close with Mary. She lives 3 hours from us but she and her wife make an effort to video call every few weeks, even more once the pandemic began. She's always checking up on us and helping us out. We are also very close to Paul.. He lives about an hour from us but before the pandemic he would drive up with the kids every other weekend; now we videochat. He helps me out with projects around the house and he we know we can call him for anything. Jake was our problem child. He's mostly turned his life around now but I feel that he tends to take advantage of us. He only calls when he needs something, uses my wife for free babysitting w/o saying thank you, and a few months ago my wife had a health scare and he was the only child to not reach out. He also lives only about an hour away but pretty much only comes over to drop the kids off.

So this is what we want to do: We want to split the remaining 30% between our children unequally. We want to give Paul 10%, Mary 10% and Jake and Matt both 5%. Our reasoning is that Paul and Mary have done more to take care of us so we want to take care of them.

Naturally Jake and Matt are not happy about this at all. Matt thinks everything should be split perfectly evenly like we originally intended and Jake thinks that the split should be based on need (and since he has the most kids he probably needs more), but I firmly disagree. I think we should be able to split our money however we like.

My husband and I recently found out we‚Äôre pregnant and will be about 11 weeks at Christmas. ¬†My husband and I are only children but have large families. This year, we‚Äôll be traveling (by car) to his family for Christmas (I have hesitancies about doing this before this but I‚Äôve been assured it will be a ""small gathering less than 15 people"") and my husband says this will be a perfect time to announce our pregnancy and he ‚Äúhas been dreaming of doing a big announcement‚Äù his whole life. ¬†He wants to wrap up onesies and give them to everyone at the same time.¬†

I‚Äôm all for supporting him telling his family however he wants to, and his parents and grandparents will be thrilled as this will be the first grandchild in the family. However, I have grave concerns about doing this because his cousin (who I suspect will be at Christmas) just shared with me that she had a miscarriage last week. ¬†It wasn‚Äôt widely known she was pregnant (and I haven't told her I'm pregnant yet), but I think we‚Äôd be terrible people if we start flouncing our pregnancy around her. ¬†I‚Äôve also pointed out to my husband that 11 weeks is still really early and the chance is there for us to miscarry as well. ¬†He argues that we won‚Äôt get a chance to do this again and we should tell his cousin our plan ahead of time so she‚Äôs not taken by surprise and can prepare, but I don‚Äôt think a woman can really mentally prepare for that and I don‚Äôt want to do that to her.¬†

So Reddit, WIBTA if we announced our pregnancy at Christmas?

&#x200B;

Edit about the onesies: He wants to hand out two gifts, one to his parents that say ""favorite grandchild"" (my husband is an only child and this is our first baby) and ""baby's first christmas"" to his grandparents (same grandparents of his cousin) with an ultrasound photo.  Cousin wouldn't be getting a gift, but she I think she'll be there, so my concerns are still the same.

&#x200B;

Edit #2: I posted this below, but we have actual Christmas gifts planned for everyone as well. I think he is thinking of this along the lines of ""oh, so and so, it looks like you forgot a gift"" scenario.

I'm really not picky on the ""gift"" of what we're tentatively giving his family...I could care less about that. I'm worried that announcing this at Christmas with other family will cause my cousin-in-law unneeded pain of her miscarriage from last week. My husband's argument is essentially 'no time is the right time' and as long as we privately tell her ahead of time then any announcement is fine.

My parents immigrated to America but struggled financially in the beginning. They had to work multiple jobs, leaving them out of the house day and night almost everyday. My sister and I stayed at home alone ever since I was 5 years old because we couldn‚Äôt afford a babysitter and we had no relatives to take care of us since they all lived back in my home country. My sister had to pick up a role more of like a guardian to me rather than being an actual sister while growing up.

Needless to say, she has done an awful job as you‚Äôd expect a child trying to be a guardian. She scolded me for the wrong reasons and tried to lecture me life lessons that didn‚Äôt make sense. I cried a lot as I grew up because of this. But no matter how painful it was, I sucked it up because I knew that both of us were dealt a crappy hand in our early lives. However, I can‚Äôt say that this upbringing hasn‚Äôt negatively impacted our relationship.

Fast forward to my teenage years, my parents are doing better financially and my mother started to stay home more while my dad provided for the family on his own. This is where I started to tell my parents about my crappy childhood and my mom broke down in tears when I basically told them that I kind of hate my sister. My parents said they had no idea and that they‚Äôre sorry for all the neglect I felt as a kid and that it‚Äôs their fault I don‚Äôt have a nice relationship with my sister. All of this is true, but I accepted their apology and I was able to rekindle my relationship with my parents pretty easily.

This interaction I had with my parents was nice and it gave me hope to maybe fix my relationship with my sister this time. When I was 16 years old, I started to initiate conversations about how I wanted our relationship to be better. This was on multiple occasions, but my sister turned me down every time. I fear that our upbringing shaped her to see me not as a younger brother but as someone she constantly needs to educate, so she often disregards what I have to say. 

My last straw with my sister was when I was 18, she had just graduated college and moved out of our house. I helped her move into her apartment, but I brought my friends without telling her just so that we could help her move in easier. She threw a tantrum when we got there saying ‚Äúyou never know from right and wrong.‚Äù She yelled at my friends while they stood there silent. She embarrassed me and called me ‚Äúa sh\*tty brother.‚Äù Now, every time I think of our relationship it takes a heavy toll on my mental health. This was the last interaction I had with my sister and I haven‚Äôt had a conversation with her ever since. I am very discouraged to reach out to her ever again, and I feel that I shouldn‚Äôt until I get an apology for all the pain she caused in my life. My parents know of this and yet they want me to reach out to her.

33,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k1vf9y/wibta_if_i_didnt_give_my_stepson_his_own_room/,WIBTA if I didn't give my stepson his own room?,"I saw a post on here yesterday that had me questioning if I am being an asshole or not. 

I am 8 months pregnant with a little girl, I have a 2 year old son, and a 9 year old step son. My husband and I are looking for a new place to live so we can accommodate the newest addition to our family! We currently live in a 2 bedroom apartment, my stepson and bio son share a room here (we have lived here for the past 3 years). I have been looking for a 4 bedroom house, but we live in a rather expensive state so 3 bedrooms just works with our budget better. My step son's mother lives 4 hours away from us, so we only have him two weekends a month, a total of four nights with exceptions for school breaks, like this week for instance is his Thanksgiving break, so we had him the entire week. 

My husband and I were talking about the move and he said ""It will be nice for O (stepson) to have his own room!"" I responded with ""Yeah if we get a 4 bedroom house."" My husband looked at me kind of funny and said ""Even if it's only a 3 bedroom O should have his own room, the younger kids can share a room. That's just how it works."" I was a little surprised by this because we only have O 4 nights a month. I think it's a little absurd to expect our son and newborn daughter to share bedrooms just to have an empty room sit around, unlived in, 90% of the time. I have been prioritizing a 4 bedroom place, as I would love for O to have a personalized room he feels welcome in when he is with us. I just feel that if we can't find one and settle with a 3 bedroom, then it's unrealistic to have both our bio children share a room, when unfortunately we don't even see O that often, whereas our bio children would obviously be living with us 100% of the time. 

I tried to explain this to my husband but he basically said in so many words that I am being an asshole and showing favoritism. I thought I was thinking logically about utilizing our living space, but maybe I'm being an asshole?

EDIT: Kind of sad I have to edit this in, but I would like to point out that I absolutely love my stepson. I have been in his life almost 8 years now, we are extremely close and open with each other. There is no animosity between me, him, his mother, or his father. We are one big family unit that has never had issues. I would never compromise his happiness or comfort and if he had ever openly expressed to me that sharing a room is a huge problem for him, I would try my damndest to work something out. But, that's not the case. I posted this because of his father's reaction, not because of anything he has personally said on the matter.

SECOND EDIT: I've said it a few times in the comments, so it might be worth mentioning that we are looking for a home to rent for the next 3 years max. By then we should have enough saved to buy a house, and I would never buy a house that didn't accommodate ALL my children perfectly. Also, I did sit down and talk with my stepson this morning about sharing a room. Basically he said he has never been bothered about sharing a room, they don't spend a ton of time in there anyways. Having his own room sounds nice, he said, but it's not a big deal if he has to share. (Humble beginnings definitely breed humble kids.) When I mentioned him having his own basement with a gaming/LEGO area his eyes lit up, he really loved the sound of that and hearing him express that verbally made his dad more comfortable with the idea of a basement as well! Plus, that fits into our budget way better than a 4th bedroom (houses are priced so weird)!

We haven't had a super easy life to start, moving into a 2 bedroom apartment when he was 5/6 was a huge improvement from our last situation. I was the breadwinner for a very long time and I would hardly call what I made ""decent bread"". My husband has since found a really reliable, steady, and well paying job, and I have gone to school and started working towards my dream job, allowing us to better save for a forever home. Thank you for all the responses, it seems pretty divided down the middle, which I get, that's why I posted here in the first place, the situation has me pretty torn.",2020-11-27 05:49:55,142,155,0.93,14,19,22,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We‚Äôve been actively discussing future life plans. We always wanted the same things in life, and we agreed on most of the topics and decisions.

One of the things we discussed a year ago was ideas about how he wanted to propose. He talked about a proposal in the mountains, or in a forest; something outdoors, simple but romantic to us. I was very happy and excited, not to mention we live between mountains and forests so it was also easily accessible.

We have been discussing this many times, even dropping ideas of which mountain would be the most romantic (we hike together, so we thought the very first mountain we‚Äôve been to for example). We also discussed who should propose who, he told me he really wanted to be the one doing it.

Yesterday, after I came back home from work exhausted, we cooked, watched tv and at some point I went to the hallway to hang a coat. He followed me and he proposed. Between the shoes on the floor, the kitchen and the restroom, he was kneeling.

I couldn‚Äôt believe it. It was such a disappointment knowing what we always talked about. I felt let down, had a lot of thoughts at once in my head.

Here is my probable asshole move: I was so hurt, I couldn‚Äôt say a word. Couldn‚Äôt even accept it. I looked at him, looked around me as I couldn‚Äôt believe where he proposed, felt the tears in my eyes. I nodded, and walked past him to lay on the bed and cry.

He took some time before following me and asking if anything was wrong. Told him I expected something different but would marry him regardless.

My friends are mixed about it, but a few of them did say I was being ungrateful and that it‚Äôs the thought that counts: he wants to marry me after all, and maybe this is the only thing that counts.

AITA?

**Update:** I would like to address a few recurring questions or remarks:

**‚Äò‚ÄôMaybe he was too excited to propose and couldn‚Äôt wait?‚Äô'** This is certainly possible, many of you commented that this is what happened to them. I am not aware if that‚Äôs the case yet, I will have to ask him tonight.

**‚Äò‚ÄôIf you don‚Äôt like your proposal, why didn‚Äôt you propose instead?‚Äô'** I did offer to propose. I didn't care who proposed!It's not because he's the man that he had to propose, he wanted to do it.

**‚Äò‚ÄôWell, my partner proposed \[this way\] and I‚Äôm happy about it!‚Äô‚Äô** I‚Äôm happy that this worked for you. Not everyone share your view on engagement, what consists of a romantic gesture. And it‚Äôs okay! The important thing is that both parties are alright with it in the end. This didn‚Äôt work for me.

**‚Äò‚ÄôWhy can‚Äôt you just be happy?‚Äô'** I am happy! I can be disappointed by the proposal and be happy and excited about being engaged. I believe both things aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive.

**‚Äò‚ÄôYou sound like a controlling/abusive person/a bridezilla who will never be happy with what he does‚Äô'** Please realize that you make a ton of assumptions on myself and my relationship based on an anonymous post.

**‚Äò‚ÄôYou are so entitled!‚Äô'** Some of you are acting as if what *we* wanted (reminder that we both brainstormed and wanted those things together, it wasn‚Äôt purely my idea) was a 5 stars hotel room, a fancy restaurant, a poney ride‚Ä¶ while in reality, it was literally about a walk outside (living 20 minutes by foot near a forest we often go to)‚Ä¶

**‚Äò‚ÄôI thought it was a sweet proposal‚Äô'** Amongst other things we talked about, we talked about things we both liked, and disliked. One of the things I disliked was the idea of being proposed at home.

Thank you for everyone for commented, I read as many comments as I could, wether they were YTA, NTA, NAH, ESH. Different opinions helped me.

I decided to apologize for my behavior because I most probably hurt him. He‚Äôs my partner, I don‚Äôt want to hurt him, no matter what.

Considering the amount of things we talked about for a year or so, and how easy it was to make something we seemingly both wanted at some point, I now believe I have a right to being disappointed, while being happy because he proposed. This is absolutely not a deal breaker for me.

I will also have a conversation and understand why it happened this way, as there might be a reason and everything will be behind us.",2020-09-17 02:07:38,1912,7335,0.92,14,27,118,2,,,,,10,2,1,,1,,,1,1,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That way, my son gets to wake up with one of his parents on Christmas morning, I get to see him on Christmas Day and his Mum doesn't miss out on any time.

His mother has outright said no, and if she does work our son would spend the morning with her partner she has only been with for the last few months, and he only moved in this week.

My wife will be Rebecca and my sister in law will be Samantha. 

I have been married to Rebecca for six years, but in total we've been together for ten years. Rebecca and I met while we were both attending school out of state, so for the first six years we rarely saw her family. Then we moved back to our home state but to a part of it that's about two and a half hours from where Rebecca's family live. After living there for two years, we moved closer to her family and are now about 45 minutes away. As a result, I've spent  lot more time with her family, especially her immediate family (mom, dad, brother, and sister). 

I always gotten along with everyone, but being this close to them and spending this much time with them has led all of us to realize how much Samantha and I have in common. Just being honest, it's a lot, lot more than my wife and I have in common. This led to us becoming fast friends and developing a close relationship, but it is, and always has been, platonic and like brother-sister. 

Getting to the point of this post, at some point someone in Rebecca's family (I think it was her dad) joked that I had married the wrong sister, and Samantha seemed to find that hilarious and played along. From that point it became a running joke that I had made a mistake and when were Samantha and I going to run off together since we were star-crossed lovers meant to be together. 

At first it made me uncomfortable and I felt like it was disrespectful to Rebecca, but over time I got used to it since Rebecca's family teases each other this way and even Rebecca started joining in and saying that she was going to divorce me because she didn't want to stand in the way of a historic love. 

I started to play along with the joke, but I tried to keep it to basic stuff like where we'd live or what color curtains we'd have - stuff I felt was harmless and not romantic. I did ask Rebecca many times to confirm she still was comfortable with it and she always said it was fine because she never had any doubts about my love for her.  

What seems to have changed things was Rebecca's pregnancy. I didn't notice any difference until Samantha made a joke about how the baby was an extra complication and how I'd have to give it up but we could have our own someday. Rebecca didn't like this and said that the whole joke was, and always had been, disrespectful and we should all know better.

In hindsight, I think it was in really poor taste and I would not have laughed and played along, but  don't think it's fair to now say I am the asshole after she encouraged me to play along and reassured me that it was fine, and the rest of her family agrees. It feels like she has suddenly changed the rules and expected me to guess, but how was I supposed to know?

37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jf9rxw/aita_for_not_buying_milk_for_my_son/,AITA for not buying milk for my son?,"My (34F) son is 8 years old. As far as my husband and I know, our son is a completely normal child for his age. Sometimes he can be a bit of a troublemaker, and other times he talks a little too much (usually about the gossip in his school), but he is overall a good child who likes riding his bike around the neighborhood with friends, playing Roblox, and painting fruit (yes, fruit. He likes painting watermelon, kiwis and avocados in particular, we have a collection.)

There's only one, tiny aspect of him that is... well, very, very peculiar. My son will pour himself a glass of milk, and then drain the rest of the milk jug down the sink. It's especially weird because he won't do this with any other drink, just milk, and he doesn't do this with food either.

When I first saw my son pouring the milk down in the sink, I was shocked and asked him why he did that. He said he just liked how it looked going down the drain. I told him he could do that with water, not milk. The second time, I got angry and told him not to. I explained to him that he's wasting money and food. But he just kept doing it. 

From there on out, this is what I tried: I reminded him that he's wasting money and food. I gave him time outs, I grounded him several times, I took away his electronics, etc. I told him he wasn't going to drink milk that day. I tried hiding it in a cooler in the garage, and I also tried putting a heavy magnet in the fridge. Then I bought those those pint sized cartons instead of jugs, but he would literally open every single unused carton and pour it down the sink. So I started to only buy milk every other week at the store. Then I started to buy milk only once a month. Then I stopped buying milk overall, because he would not learn.

Now I don't think it is a love/hate thing, because my son ironically really likes milk. He would drink 3 cups of it every single day by himself. When I stopped buying milk, he would just kind of mope around the house looking for something to drink. I told him to drink water. He says water doesn't quench his thirst like milk does. I said he could drink milk all he wants if he stopped pouring it down the drain. He said okay, but then poured it down the drain anyways later.

It's been about 3 months now with no milk. I do have a few cartons of those shelf stable milk cartons hidden away in the pantry just in case, but other than that, there is no milk in our house at all. My MIL recently came over to babysit for an evening and was very shocked to find out that we have no milk in our house. When my husband and I came home that evening, she yelled at us and called it child abuse that we would deprive our son of essential nutrients during a critical growing time. I told her that he keeps pouring the milk down in the drain but she would have none of it. AITA here?",2020-10-21 09:40:16,421,2265,0.97,2,23,123,2,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jf7fxi/aita_for_accidentally_miss_gendering_my_daughter/,AITA for accidentally miss gendering my daughter?,"First time using Reddit.

Me (Male 32) and my adopted Daughter (Female 15) live alone in my house after my Ex decided to walk out of the picture right after adopting her.

And since quarantine started due to the virus I have started to notice small things that I usually wouldn't have noticed due to working almost all day, like her starting to act more feminine or secretly doing activities that are normally called ""girl only"" activities by society, and I started to think that she might be gay (I didn't know that Transgender was a thing until yesterday).

So I started to think in how to tell her that I supporter her when she eventually came out to me.

And she came out to me yesterday, she told me that she was Gay and Transgender, I didn't know what transgender was and told her ""Well, I don't exactly know what Transgender is but I'm always gonna consider you my son and I'm always gonna support you"", and yes I know I fucked up by saying that, she started to cry and run to her bedroom and locked herself inside, and now after searching what Transgender is I starter to feel like shit and I wanted to ask for the opinion of reddit.

AITA for doing an honest mistake and accidentally miss gendering my daughter?

UPDATE: After reading all the replies and getting some advice, I went to my daughter's room and apologized for miss gendering her and for now knowing what Transgender was, I also told her that what I really meant was that she will always be my child no matter gender or sexuality.

She cried happy tears this time knowing that she has someone that will support her uncondicionally.

After that we talked a little bit about how she feels and what I should do to help her during her transition.

Thanks Reddit, you all helped me a lot :)",2020-10-21 06:09:46,381,2459,0.93,5,113,38,0,3,2,,2,3,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I‚Äôve been honest with him from the start that I don‚Äôt see myself as a woman and that I might someday want to do something about the dysphoria. In February I decided to contact my country‚Äôs transgender health service (with Harry‚Äôs blessing) and I‚Äôll be allowed to start T mid next year.

Harry‚Äô straight so this has naturally caused some issues, but he‚Äôs adapting well to the potential changes and I‚Äôm hopeful.

As far as his family knows, I am and always have been a woman. I‚Äôve been alright with this, they‚Äôre all very nice people and I know Harry doesn‚Äôt want to get into the complexities of his sexuality and where I fit into that. For my part, I‚Äôve been as openly non-binary as a person can be without having the Gender 101 discussion with everyone and I‚Äôm not too fussed if people read me as a butch straight woman. 

Recently this out-but-not-quite thing has stopped working for me, because of Harry‚Äôs nephew ‚ÄúAaron‚Äù (16m). Aaron came out as trans two years ago. He also struggles a lot with anxiety and depression. The whole family have been very supportive of him, but obviously being a dysphoric 16 year old with mental health problems is hell. I should know, I was one.

For a while now, I‚Äôve been making the occasional suggestion that my husband at least tell his brother about my transness so Aaron would have the option of talking to someone who gets it. A few days ago Aaron had a bad downswing and was admitted to inpatient psych care, and I‚Äôve become adamant that my transness be made known and my number offered to Aaron in case he wants to chat.

I‚Äôve only met Aaron in person once, he lives on the other side of our country, so it would entirely be a case of ‚Äúhey, chelaluna is trans and had a rough time as a teenager, they said you‚Äôre welcome to text them if you want to talk‚Äù. Honestly, from what I remember of being a teenager, just knowing that an adult like me existed and was happy and well would have made a world of difference.

Harry‚Äôs responses so far have been ‚Äúremind me later‚Äù or ‚Äúyeah, I could see how that would be helpful‚Äù. He changes the subject when I bring it up. He‚Äôs a generally conflict avoidant person and tends to do this with difficult conversations. Last night he got angry with me for ‚Äúkeep bringing it up‚Äù and ‚Äúnot letting him think it through‚Äù and he‚Äôs been distant today.

I am trying to be understanding of Harry‚Äôs issues here. This is a complex situation and he‚Äôs doing his best to deal with everything. Had Aaron not had this crisis I‚Äôd‚Äôve been happy to let him work stuff out in his own time. I get that he‚Äôd basically be outing himself to his family and generating some awkward conversations.

But a) I‚Äôll be starting T next year and it‚Äôll start being obvious anyway and b) Aaron deserves to have this option.

So, AITA for trying to push my husband into outing us both sooner rather than later?

EDIT: we live in a country with a very low population and most of us live in small rural towns and villages. His town has about 800 people in it, mine has 850. Options like support groups etc don‚Äôt really exist outside of the capital city. Which is why I think Aaron would benefit from knowing someone like himself exists in his circle.

As for offering myself up as support, the ball would absolutely be in Aaron‚Äôs court. I just want him to know he has the option. As lovely as his parents are, he is going through stuff that‚Äôs very different to anything they dealt with at his age.",2020-11-22 14:09:36,128,289,0.83,14,9,8,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They do look great I have to admit, and we both love them during the day. But at night..... my gosh this woman slings them over to my side of the bed like a soldier chucking grenades from the trenches. She will literally throw all of them onto my side of the bed and go to sleep like nothing is wrong. She does this every night, which has caused us to be in a pillow war. Every night we find new and weird ways to piss each other off with how we can arrange the pillows only on the other persons side. Today I had the brilliant idea of letting her beat me to bed today so she stacks them all on my side. When she fell asleep, I built basically a pillow fort all around her with pillows from every room in our house. It was very unstable and fell as soon as she moved even an inch. Which was hilarious because she got hit with about 5 different pillows at once and she freaked out thinking someone was attacking her or something. Now she‚Äôs mad at me. AITA, or is all fair in love and pillow war?



TLDR: I built a pillow fort above my wife as she slept and it collapsed on her causing her to freak out.

EDIT: my gosh this blew up! First off, thank you all so much for the awards and love. To answer a few questions, we do not genuinely get upset at each other, it‚Äôs all out of love. We are newlyweds who have only been married for a few months. We only do this because we know it‚Äôs a competition to see who can have the best arrangement.

My mom quickly remarried and my dad has been seeing his new girlfriend for nearly 2 years now. I now live at mom's house for two weeks, then switch over to dad's house for the next two weeks.

My relationship with my mom has always been difficult. I always felt like my mom wished for a more 'girly' daughter, so we could do classical mother-daughter activities together but I'm simply not that person my mom wants me to be. I've always been more 'tomboyish' and been into sports, especially tennis since was a little girl, something my mom never truly understood or made an effort to be interested in. As a result my mom and I never had the close mother-daughter relationship I feel like my mom wished for us to have.

Now my relationship with my dad has been the polar opposite. My dad and I always got along great and I have always been a 'daddy's girl'. But when my dad introduced me to his new girlfriend Julia, I instantly disliked her. My younger me thought she was stealing my dad from me. Her being relatively young (27 when they began dating), and a - how I unfairly stereotyped her at first - 'vapid pretty girl' certainly didn't make me like her either. But my younger me misjudged her, and she's honestly pretty great. She always supported me, showed in interest in my passions, showed up to my tennis matches - something my mom didn't bother to do - and has been a great person all around. I'm now ashamed to admit this but I didn't recognize this until \~3 months ago and have been acting pretty horrible towards her before that.

The problem: Second last weekend I had a tennis tournament where I got second place. For the second place, I won a spa day for me and a guest. I decided to invite Julia (my dad's gf) to thank her for supporting me and for dealing with my horrible behavior. You don't believe how happy she was when I invited her. But when I returned to my mom's place on Sunday evening my mom kind of assumed I would invite her as my guest for the spa day. She seemed to really look forward to it. When I awkwardly told her that I already invited Julia she was disappointed and sad. Since then, she has acted downcast and moody, and we haven't really talked. I tried to explain the situation to her, but she won't listen.

Now I feel horrible. I feel like really hurt my mom and I feel like I chose Julia over her.

And we had until we were 30 years old to use it before the money went to my dad to use as he wished.

When I graduated high school, I got an interesting job and decided against college.

My dad asked me if I was very sure when I was 20 that I'm not going down the college path, and I said no.

My younger half sister ended up going to a private college. She's two years younger than me.

I'm now 26. My job has a program where they pay 25% of a 4 year college program for qualified employees.

I got accepted to an awesome school and with a scholarship, my company's contributions and the 50 thousand from the trust, I would graduate with zero debt.

So I told my dad about my plan and he immediately panicked. Apparently he gave all the money to my sister because I had said I wasn't going to college. She graduated with zero debt.

I was pissed off that he had done this without at least giving me a heads up. I then reminded him that the money was legally mine and that I expected to receive it.

In the end, my dad had to take out a loan to give me the money. His wife is furious about the situation and my dad is upset with me.

I'm really enjoying college at least, even if it is online.

I love my sister to death but she is definitely insecure about how she looks and she can be sensitive. My sister is at a normal healthy weight for her height and age but would definitely be told to lose weight and I feel like that would really hurt her self confidence and self worth.

I told my sister that maybe modeling isn‚Äôt for her and she took at as me calling her ugly. My sister is very very pretty and would be a good model but shes just so sensitive.

We were evicted because our landlord sold the apartment. It was a good friend that had been renting to us and well below market rate. Basically they were breaking even. We have not been able to find anything within our budget (been searching for about 6 months). We've applied to a few one bedrooms but I feel they discriminate against families. They almost always say the place is too small. It's bigger than a fucking a tent, I'll tell you that.

My kids have been going between a few friends houses while my wife and I sleep in parks (shelters are closed because of the pandemic). we visit the kids on weekends (no way to travel to them during the week). We had to sell our vehicle and now sleep walking distance to our jobs. Kids are a few towns over where its cheaper and where we were living (no work besides minimum wage).

My sister lives bussing distance to our works, near some good schools and I've repeatedly begged her if we could stay with her until we've got things figured out. It's killing my wife and I being away from our kids. Things are just genuinely horrible all around and my wife's mental state is going down hill fast. All she does is cry.

We don't use drugs. We don't drink. We work. We are TRYING but my sister refuses to help. She very much lives a kid free lifestyle and is definitely the sort that think people who don't have much money are just lazy. She continuously calls me lazy and stupid for my current situation.

It came to a head last night when my wife was talking about how she's extraordinarily depressed and does much have the will to go on much longer. She's never talked like that before and it scared me so I contacted my sister again and really begged to allow us to stay or at the very least just my wife for awhile.

Her husband ended up taking the phone and telling me I'm an asshole for keeping asking when they've said no repeatedly. I said I'm desperate and I'd do literally anything to stay. He reiterated that I'm an asshole, told me to fuck off and not to contact them again.",2020-10-06 19:34:47,868,1995,0.95,35,21,30,10,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We pay an outrageous amount of money in rent, the deposit was like 3 times the rent. The only rules she had and the only rules on the lease are no smoking indoors, no major modifications to the interior and any damage not covered by the deposit would come out of our pocket. Very standard and straight forward. 

I wouldn‚Äôt say my relationship with her is bad or good, we‚Äôve been here 2 years and I‚Äôve seen her a grand total of 4 times. I always pay her on time and she repairs things quickly enough so all good there. We are good tenants and we can‚Äôt complain about her.

Occasionally she will come pick up her mail as some of it still gets sent here. I invite her in for some coffee when that‚Äôs the case as I have nothing to hide. Well she saw the ashtray on the porch and the bong in the living room. It wasn‚Äôt out in the open but on a shelf. She instantly freaked out saying it made her extremely uncomfortable that we were doing illegal things in her house. 

I told her that we never ever smoke inside, we always take it outside, the house doesn‚Äôt smell at all and it was all purchased legally. She went off on a tangent and started getting an attitude and asked me to not do that anymore. I told her as nicely as possible that as long as I‚Äôm not breaking any of her rules, and I‚Äôm not damaging anything in the house (which I‚Äôm not) that it‚Äôs not really any of her business what I do here. 

I asked her if she noticed a smell in the house but she just huffed at me, told me she‚Äôd be back in a few months for her mail and she left. I sent her the rent money and she said thank you as usual but my mom says I was TA for saying that 

AITA?

EDIT: I live in California and I‚Äôm over 21, it‚Äôs completely legal for recreational use. If it wasn‚Äôt legal here I would agree with her not wanting it in her house. But as far as the law is concerned there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it

Food arrived. I took it inside and immediately went back outside. The adrenaline had worn off by then and I noticed it was cold so I asked if she wanted to go inside after 5 minutes. She said no. I then went inside after waiting with her 35 minutes total - there was nothing we could do but wait and she had been standing away from me when we were waiting. I asked her a few times if she was ok or needed anything. She said no.

She usually deals with stress by being alone and usually asks for some space - she is not upset I didn't continue to wait with her and that is not what I'm asking about. She is upset that I was able to eat food whilst this was all going on. I know her and the hints I was getting from her body language was that I wasn't helping by hovering around her anyway.

Whilst I'm happy my step Dad is alive and have no harsh feelings to him, I don't know him that well. I was concerned for him but I don't know him well enough to truly panic. I saw him every other year for a few weeks of my life and I've known him this time for a few months. Nice guy, glad he's ok, but I can't force myself to love him like family. When I went inside I was cold, tired from a 12 hour shift and performing CPR, and I hadn't eaten in a few hours. I was on autopilot as the adrenaline had worn off. Perhaps it was insensitive of me but I thought I had done all I could at that point.

Again, my Mum is not upset I went inside. She's upset I ate as she thinks I don't care about my step Dad. I do care but not to the extent she'd like. That is the issue - not whether I left her outside.

I also did all I could in terms of CPR, talking to paramedics, and offering her my support verbally. Someone suggested I should have driven her to hospital - we were waiting outside the ambulance and I don't drive. I'm also 18 and here on an apprenticeship program so there are limits to what I can offer to do for her practically. My apprenticeship involves manual work which is doubly exhausting. Right now we're on lockdown so I'm the only one working in our household and I think she forgets how tiring shift work is as she hasn't done it for months. We're also in the UK and I think Americans have some strange ideas about what you do in a crisis - she would have killed me if I'd started calling all her friends to come over mid heart attack. We also deal with things in a bit more of a repressed way so we don't do the whole sobbing and hugging thing Americans seem to think should be going on. 

\-----

Last night I got off work late so I ordered food. I'm staying with my Mum and step Dad for a few months. I never knew him that well as I grew up with my bio Dad from age 6 when my parents split. I visited my Mum every other summer and we've always been on friendly terms but never super close until I moved to their city for work. I'm staying until I can find a place to rent myself.

Shortly before my take-out arrived my step Dad collapsed. My Mum called me for help and of course I helped. We called an ambulance and gave him first aid together until the paramedics took over. They got a pulse and transferred him to the ambulance. They lost the pulse in the ambulance and couldn't take him to hospital until they got it back - the woman explained this to us before shutting the doors.

Around this point my take-out arrived. I paid and explained what was happening as the delivery guy was obviously kind of freaked out by the ambulance outside where he was dropping off food. I took the food inside and came back out to check on my Mum. She was waiting outside the ambulance and wasn't allowed in while they were working on my step Dad. I stayed with her for about 5 minutes and then suggested we go wait inside as it was cold. She said no she'd wait outside.

I said to call me if she needed me and went inside. I had already ordered the food, it was there and going cold, I hadn't eaten in hours so I just decided to eat while I waited. Mum came inside and found me eating and told me it was selfish of me to be eating when a family member was dying. I stopped eating as it was clearly upsetting her.

Step Dad is alive today. He had a heart attack but his chances look good. I'm genuinely glad he's ok. This morning Mum told me she can't believe how cold and callous I am and she thinks I hate her and my step Dad and blame them for my parents divorce. I don't hate either - I didn't think me eating take out while we waited was a cold thing but it seems to have really upset her. I don't care about the divorce anymore either.

For context the whole incident from calling the ambulance to the ambulance leaving took an hour and 15 minutes. Food arrived halfway through all of this and there was nothing I could have done to help.",2020-11-09 18:27:26,186,471,0.97,23,23,16,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Edit:

Wife has finished work and we've had a talk about it.

It seems wife doesnt trust SIL with the kids as there are some incidents in the past that I was not fully aware of (nothing abusive, just unsafe - falling asleep when watching children etc). Wife doesn't want SIL dealing with the kids alone for this reason.

I have also mentioned potential thyroid issues as there are more than a few symptoms that line up.

Thank you all for your help and advice

It does make it trickier to get time alone, but we can work around it.

We've essentially kissed and made up.

Thank you all again



Some backstory:

My wife seems to be tired all the time, she has suffered depression in the past which often manifested as fatigue. I let her sleep whenever I can

I work permanent nights so I can be home with my son and daughter whilst my wife is at work. I have worked nights for 5 years so far.

Currently, my sister-in-law (SIL) is staying with us due to an unrelated situation at her home

Onto the current situation:

I was at work last night, as usual, when I recieved a message from SIL saying that my daughter (aged 4) had woken up and she didn't know what to do. My wife was still asleep.

I told SIL to give Daughter a small drink, then tuck her back up into bed, explaining to her that it is night time so she needs to sleep because night time is for sleeping

SIL handled the situation, daughter went back to sleep, all sorted.

This morning I got home, made my wife a coffee and woke her up for work, and mentioned that Daughter had woken in the night. Wife responded by saying ""someone should have woken me up""

""Why? The situation was handled, there was no need for you to miss out on sleep""

""I could have bought her into bed with me and she would have slept""

""She can't keep coming into our bed in the night when she wakes up, she needs to sleep in her own bed""

""Well at least then I wouldn't have had to be in bed alone!""

""That's unfair. You know I would rather be in bed with you but one of us has to work nights so someone can be here for the kids. There's no way I can win here""

""You already have.""

Then she stormed off to the bathroom and slammed the door.

Now she's pissed off with me for not waking her up, even though she is tired all the time, I was trying to let her get some sleep and I didn't see any reason why she would need to wake up if the situation was handled.

I tried to speak with her in the kitchen by saying ""would you rather I wake you up or let you get sleep? You're tired all the time I was just trying to let you rest""

""I AM tired all the time. I can cope with being tired. You should have woken me up""

""Ok, I'll know that for the future""

Then she stormed past me again saying ""I need to get ready for work""

I have been stationed overseas until January of 2020. I would come back to the states for the holidays. Due to the length of stay overseas, my state ID expired, so my only forms of ID were my military ID and passport.

FYI california passed a law in 2016 that sets the legal age to buy tobacco & related products to 21. Military are exempt from this age restrictions, but I was 27-28 at the time (birthday happened during the time). And I am a cigar smoker.

Onto the story.

In December 2017-January 2018 I was in california visiting family for the holidays. One day the eldest of my younger sisters decided to go for a walk. I tagged along because well, I haven't seen her for a few years and wanted to catch up.

We walked around for an hour or so and ended up at a park. I had felt the usual addict urge at this point and ask to go to a more secluded area. I am very concerned about second hand and impressions on young children. We did, pull out my zippo and... nothing. It's gone dry. Que immediate cursing like the sailor I am.

We had passed a 7/11 when we entered into the park, so I told her I was going to buy a lighter there. I had left my passport at family member I was stay with. So I figures there wouldn't be any problems or anything, quick in and out and I'd get my fix.

I get in the store, grab a lighter and headed to the cashier. Before the cashier asked for my ID I showed my military ID. The cashier asked to look it over, so I handed it to them. Now I have dealt with bars not knowing where the date of birth is on a military ID so I informed the cashier where it was.

The cashier handed my ID back and said its fake. I asked them why they thought it was fake. ""Its fake because I've never seen an ID like that before."" Okay, I doubt many people that aren't anywhere near a military base would have ever seen one. I told the cashier that it's a military ID.

Now remember, military is exempt from the 21 age law, and the ID shows that I am an Active Duty Service Member. They still claim it to be fake, so I pulled up the cac.mil website and showed them the sample ID. (The website is an official Department of Defense website. Literally a government website) They still believe it to be fake, so I asked for a manager. ""My manager will say it is fake also. And they are not here currently. It is only me.""

Can you call for your manager? ""No.""

At this point, I am getting agitated, I grilled them about the law, their and the manager's name and number. I asked a lot more questions but I don't remember them off the top.of my head.

At this point the cashier looks scared. I should note, that he was taller and definitely had more muscle than me. The cashier just said fine and let me purchase the lighter.

Now I admit, I myself think I was the asshole, but also the cashier for refusing to contact the manager. Thoughts?

TL:DR. Cashier thought my military ID was fake, refused to call manager. I grilled the cashier, cashier gave in.",2020-11-25 16:11:28,84,130,0.92,6,3,16,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My husband (30M) and I (27F) have been together for 5 years, married for 3. Our relationship and marriage has been nothing short of amazing the whole time we‚Äôve been together, but lately he‚Äôs been having some weird issues. To name a few, he has started talking to me in code that he swears I understand. It‚Äôs English, but the words are jumbled, they make no sense whatsoever, and when I don‚Äôt understand what he is saying he will either laugh and say I don‚Äôt remember our ‚Äúinside joke‚Äù or get really upset. He says this has always been our language and this is how we express our love to each other. That‚Äôs probably the weirdest thing. 

Another example is he has started claiming that my own father hates him. This isn‚Äôt true. My father loves my husband. He always has. He is extremely paranoid that my father shows up at our house at night. He gets up at least once or twice a night to check the doors and windows, sometimes walks outside with a flashlight looking around for him. He simply thinks my father is out to get him. Every time I try to talk to him about this he tells me I don‚Äôt understand but ‚ÄúI will soon.‚Äù I‚Äôve also noticed he has started to put things in the wrong places. For example, he put chips in the refrigerator, his wallet in the cupboard, peanut butter in the freezer, toilet paper in the pantry (it goes in the bathroom) and has even put our remote inside the shams of our pillows. 

He also spends almost all of his time on his laptop and won‚Äôt tell me what he‚Äôs doing. Every time I come near him he slams his laptop closed. I finally broke and told him I‚Äôm sick of his fucking delusions and that I can‚Äôt be in a marriage with someone I can no longer understand or communicate with. I called him a shell of the man he used to be and that I regret marrying him. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have said these things but I‚Äôm so exhausted, I‚Äôm so confused, I‚Äôve tried to get him help and he refuses. He hasn‚Äôt spoken to or looked at me since this incident. 


AITA for blowing up on him when he could be suffering from something serious and not wanting to listen to his delusions/deal with his weird behavior anymore?

Edit: Thank you to those of you that encouraged me and gave me advice, I‚Äôm going to try to talk to him about a psychiatrist or psych facility tonight (and I‚Äôm terrified)",2020-10-18 02:42:55,400,1620,0.96,17,18,50,0,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My wife (38F) and I (42M) have a relationship built on complete honesty and it‚Äôs something I value highly. This is why I think I might be TA

Yesterday my wife had a really rough day at work and was feeling very anxious in bed last night. She said that there‚Äôs so much going through her head and she won‚Äôt be able to sleep at all, but really needed to because she had such a big day at work the next day. 

We usually have sleeping pills that we take only in these extreme situations where we need a really good sleep. Maybe only a couple of times a year. 

She asked for a sleeping pill last night, as I keep them next to my bed. I looked over and realised we were out and told her. She was very upset and said ‚Äògreat now I‚Äôm not going to be able to sleep and it‚Äôs going to ruin my day‚Äô. 

I looked down and saw that we had some over the counter antihistamines (think claritin, non-drowsy) and they have a very similar shape and size to the sleeping pills we normally have. 

A split second thought occurred to me and I grabbed one, and told her that I found one last one in the bottom of the drawer, and handed it to her. 

She was very thankful, took the pill, and settled in to go to sleep. In 15 minutes she was out like a light. 

This morning I asked how she slept, and she said she had a great nights sleep and thanked me again. 

I know it only worked because of the placebo effect, which only worked because I was dishonest with her. She has taken these antihistamines before so I wasn‚Äôt worried about any unknown effects. 

Did I do bad? AITA? I‚Äôm also torn as to whether to come clean this morning.

Update: I told her. She was very surprised how well it worked and said that the antihistamine never made her sleepy before. Then jokingly was upset with me for telling her because now that she knows, the placebo effect won‚Äôt work again. There you go. 

Thanks all for the advice. Quite a divided response. Bless this sub.",2020-10-26 22:35:51,192,2172,0.98,14,30,33,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I also started college in 2016, so I‚Äôve only been around his new wife when I was home on break or holiday. She is nice enough, but we don‚Äôt have a deep relationship whatsoever. She also pretends to be my mom and tells people I‚Äôm her child which I despise- I met her when I was 17 years old. 

Now I‚Äôm about to graduate college and I really want my dad, sister, and brother to come. This is a big accomplishment for me and I want to celebrate as a family. I told my dad I‚Äôd love for him to come but I don‚Äôt want his new wife to attend. We aren‚Äôt that close and it would just remind me my own mom can‚Äôt be there, which kills me. 

My dad refused to come unless his wife comes. He would also pay for my siblings tickets (since they‚Äôre younger) and so they wouldn‚Äôt be able to come either. This means I won‚Äôt have any family at graduation. 

I feel hurt my dad is doing this. However, he believes I‚Äôm in the wrong and says it‚Äôs so unfair that I‚Äôm putting him in this position. I feel like it‚Äôs my day and I should be able to say who can come.

Living in an area where 3 bedroom houses are extremely affordable including land ($300K-400K AUD) it is a perfect investment opportunity. My parents have offered some support to help fund my deposit where as my new full time job has allowed me to secure a loan from the bank. Very excited to begin the next stage of adulthood.

During the initial planning process, my gf has offered suggestions here and there to improve the house flow which I have happily thought about and even included in the designs. But today she mentioned that she said to her work collegues that ""we were building a house"" and the other night she said ""I don't like that design choice, I want you to change it because I hate it. It looks like a prison"" (Just some window's that look like jail bars even though I really don't see it that way). But the way she said it felt very demanding. I could of been reading it wrong but the way I felt afterwards just didn't sit right with me.

I asked her that it is my first house that I want to build and have it constructed my way. I'm putting the deposit in, my parents have helped me as well and have a small stake in it too. They even have gone as far as writing up a contract to say the deposited money belongs to them (because it's their investment). This money I will pay back to them when my inheritence comes through. Because I've been in this relationship for 4 years (lived together for 9 months), defacto laws will almost basically apply and she can technically have a right to some ownings and assets like the house and deposit from my parents (But they want a contract signed to prevent that), if we ever decided to break up.

I do not believe she has ever had any intent to ever do such a thing and I trust her fully, I want this to become a home we can share together and potentially build a life in. I know later in life if we get married things will become ""ours"" and not ""his"" and ""hers"", but at this current stage in a our relationship I feel like some things are still our own. This is my first house I'm building, I want it built the way I want it, because I'm making the hefty deposit along with my parents to get it built and she hasn't put any stake into it (Not that I'm wanting her to at this time, just typical portion of rent for the mortgage payments like any landlord would). I am happy to take on board suggestions, but I just wonder if she has gotten carried away with this as something she can have change because she thinks it's ""her house"" too. Even though once it's built I'm happy to work together to make it ""our home"" we live in like any rental place we would do in the past.

So am I the asshole for telling her that it's my house and not hers at this time?

Edit: I think one important aspect I have missed is. **This house really is a stepping stone, it's an investment opportunity for me at this current time frame, thanks to grants from the government in Australia.** Later we can put our earnings together and go for a better dream home, one that we could prepare for as a family. I'm only 25 and we have agreed to aim to have kids after the age of 30 (that is my limit where I feel comfortable doing so). We can use the house as leverage and apply our incomes together to get an even bigger loan to build a potential dream family home later in a few years that we both compromise and love the look of.

At this moment, it's a house that I want built the way that I want right now. But together I'm happy to build a home within that we can come back to after work and feel happy and comfortable in.

Edit 2: I will bring up a point in terms of this being reversed. If she was doing the same thing as me and building a house by herself with her own money as the deposit, I would 100% support her decision and never try to claim it as our house. Happy to offer suggestions in stuff that may work but ultimately let her make the final call. It's her effort and her work putting towards it and I would support her for that, I would never try to stoke a claim as it being ""mine"" at this time because I never put a large down payment towards it.

Edit 3: Maybe another tad bit of information for her side. **In regards to wanting to put something in with the deposit for the house, she refused and didn't want too go joint with it.** Because her brother did a joint deposit with his gf and they broke up a year later. And the fallout with the spliting of assets/deposits has been a nightmare and she doesn't want to deal with that anxiety.",2020-10-11 12:34:23,484,1465,0.94,40,21,53,3,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To start this off, I want to say that while I don‚Äôt agree with every single aspect of the Catholic Church, my (23F) beliefs do play a significant role in my life (spiritually and culturally), like mass every Sunday and some religious icons in my home. This is all very normal for me, as I was raised in a very Catholic family in a very Catholic country. However, I would never attempt to forcibly convert anyone, especially my atheist boyfriend (24M) to my religion.

The issue started when I wanted to get a priest to bless the apartment and I wanted to put a small figure of the Virgin Mary with a tea candle on the nightstand next to my side of the bed (he has his own nightstand as well on his side). He wasn‚Äôt raised religious and has no ties or resent towards the church, which means that he accepts that I am religious and doesn‚Äôt care, but doesn‚Äôt join. I am completely okay with that, but when I tried to get the apartment blessed and put up the figure, which are very commonly done in my culture and are parts of my religious expression, he got angry and said that he doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable with me doing this in an apartment that was as much his as mine. I never said he had to believe in it and thought that since he doesn‚Äôt really care about religion he‚Äôd be indifferent to it like he is indifferent to me attending Mass and doing things like praying the rosary with my family when they come visit. He just never joins in and we all respect that. He claims that he feels that I am trying to force my views on him with this and that he doesn‚Äôt want religion in his home, but I‚Äôm really just trying to follow my beliefs.

When E behaves or listens well, I make a point to thank her and to tell her that she's doing a great job/listening really well, etc. I've done sticker charts and all that for cleaning, bedtime and the potty which all have seemed to work well. She just really has a hard time listening.

MIL was over and E told me that she wanted MIL to put her to bed. MIL has put E to bed before and likes doing it. I was giving the kids a bath and E took one of her toys full of water and dumped it on the floor. I told E to please keep water in the tub. E moved on to splashing water on the baby. I don't mind if E pours water on the baby's belly, but she kept holding the toy up high and water was splashing the baby's face. I asked E to stop and she didn't, so I took the toy away. Then E kept taking a wet wash rag and holding it over the edge of the tub. I told E to stop getting water on the floor again. She didn't listen. So I told her that if she doesn't listen, I won't let MIL put her to bed. She kept doing it and I started counting. I reminded her calmly what the consequence was if she didn't stop. I got to 3 and told her MIL can't put her to bed. E lost her shit thrashing around in the tub. I pulled her out and told her that was enough and she starts hitting and kicking. I called my husband to watch the baby and took E to her room. E was crying/screaming. I got her ready for bed and told her that I needed her to calm down a bit so we could talk and hugged her. We went over what happened and why. How she needs to be careful with the baby b/c she could hurt them and how she needs to try her best to listen better so things go better for us both.

I went out and told my MIL that I was going to put her to bed and my MIL got upset and was crying and said that she would appreciate it if I didn't ""use her"" that way and she felt like she needed to say something about it. I told her that I made sure to tell E that it wasn't because MIL didn't want to. E came out to say goodnight and they were both crying. I went back into E's room and talked to her again. I made sure she understood that MIL was not putting her to bed only because that was something I decided; not because she didn't want to - and that we both love her very much.

AITA? I can see where MIL's coming from and I'm going to avoid that from now on, but I think that crying about it infront of E like that was inappropriate. I'm not a perfect mom, but she just really made me feel like I was wrong. It's hard to know what the right thing to do is all the time as a parent and it just made me feel like shit.

In addition to shared requirements (can‚Äôt be too noisy or too small, has to be in a nice building, etc.), we each have our personal requirements which we‚Äôve agreed to compromise on. For example, she needs to be near a certain subway line. I need the apartment to have a dishwasher.

One apartment we‚Äôre looking at is perfect, except for the fact that it doesn‚Äôt have a dishwasher. My girlfriend absolutely loves the place and is very insistent we try and move in. I told her that as we agreed beforehand, the lack of a dishwasher is a dealbreaker. I‚Äôve lived with and without dishwashers and will never go back to not having one. She‚Äôs only ever lived in places with dishwashers and does not understand how much more work hand washing everything is. She insists that it‚Äôs not much extra work, and that I‚Äôm being lazy. Important to note that we both love to cook a lot and therefore always have a lot of dishes to clean up.

WIBTA if I told her that if we move here, it‚Äôs only fair that she do the majority of the dishes? From my experience, having a dishwasher cuts washing time at least in half, so I think it would be fair for her to do twice as many dishes as I would.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for suggesting a portable dishwasher! I honestly had no idea these existed. I brought this up with my girlfriend and she is 100% willing to split whatever the cost of one is, so we're gonna get something fancy. Now just fingers crossed that the apartment in question is still available!

I agree that I would have been the AH if I insisted on unevenly splitting dishes. When I wrote this post, I was irrationally annoyed at my girlfriend's dismissal of how long it takes to do dishes without a dishwasher, and in retrospect my ask would have done nothing but create resentment on both sides.",2020-10-15 14:39:25,380,947,0.96,23,34,41,6,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My mom died when I was 8 and my dad remarried when I was 10. My little sisters were 7 and 6 at the time of our dad getting remarried. I admit I wasn't exactly happy that our dad remarried. I felt it was unfair to push it on us so fast. He said he deserved to be happy and we needed a mother. I told him nobody else could be our mother. He told me I couldn't speak for my sisters. Then I corrected that I could speak for me and I wasn't going to ever have a mom again.

His wife for the most part did seem to genuinely try but she pissed me off on some things. Mainly she didn't like me calling her by her first name and wanted a mom nickname (she suggested mum, ma, momma) and I didn't like the idea of giving her a mom centric name and refused. She didn't like my refusal. She also didn't like that I refused to celebrate her on Mother's Day. I told them to pick another day if she wanted to feel special but Mother's Day was a day for me was a day for my mom and my grandmothers, not anybody else. Then the next offense came when I said I did not want to be there when she gave birth (she and my dad have two kids together). She tried to make my sisters be there too and they were uncomfortable so I stood up for them. She thought I was influencing them too much. Our dad always sided with her so my issues with her are also issues with him but I also have outside issues with him. The final one came when I was graduating and the tickets were being sent directly to our houses. We were asked whether it should be addressed to ""The Parent of"" or ""The Parents of"" and I chose Parent over Parents. She said she deserved recognition in having the tickets addressed to Parents.

I moved out pretty soon after my 18th birthday and have not really returned since... which has upset them. I live with my boyfriend and stay in touch with my sisters but honestly I don't have a relationship with my dad that means much to me anymore so I am not really in touch with anyone else.

They asked me to go to family therapy with them and my sisters so we can work out everything and become closer. I said no. They think I'm an ass for not wanting to give it a shot. But I know we won't agree on this and I know I will never accept her as my mother or believe he did enough for me after I lost my mom so I'm not seeing a point when the first one is THE issue that has come up all the time since they got married and the latter is something my dad doesn't want to hear. But I'm wondering if I should go for my sisters. IDK.

My boyfriend and I discussed the fact that his dogs are always in the big dog's bed, and he went out and got them a nice new  fluffy dog bed (big enough for both of them to snuggle up in, which they seem to enjoy) that sits on the ground, in the hopes his doggies would lay in it.....They dont give two craps about the bed and every time I look, one of them is ln my dogs bed and my dog is on the floor with his old man legs.

However, since I‚Äôve started dating my current boyfriend, my cat attacked him (unprovoked) twice. Once when he entered my home without me (with permission of course) and the last time was 5 months ago when we were laughing pretty and joking pretty loudly. Since then, all has been normal.

Since things have cooled, I‚Äôve tried getting my boyfriend to actively try and mend their relationship since I love them both and I want everyone to get along. He‚Äôs not about it, which is... okay. 

HOWEVER, last week we were walking back home from the store, and passing my living room window where my cat was sitting. I greeted my cat per usual, and started unlocking my door. My boyfriend who was behind me, just let out this insane ripper of a fart go. I freeze, and when I turn to look at him, his a** is pressed firmly against my OPEN window with my cat sitting directly in the blast zone. 

I yelled, DID YOU JUST FART ON MY CAT?! And my boyfriend would just not stop laughing. I wanted him to apologize, because I thought it petty and I felt bad for my cat, but he couldn‚Äôt do it without laughing and I‚Äôm still a little iffy about it.

My boyfriend (26M) & I (25F) plan on getting married after the pandemic has subsided & will have kids in a few years bc I will likely have fertility problems after age 30 (family history).

I don't want to share real names but my boyfriend's name is a really common historical name that doesn't pop up as much anymore in modern generations. I'll use ""John"" for simplicity. His family has lived in our state for over a century & the first John [bf's last name] was the governor in the 1800s/1900s. All that to say it's become a small tradition to use the name John in his family.

He is very adamant about naming one of his children John. I asked what he wanted to do if we only had girls and he said he'd still want to name one John, or maybe a similar, more feminine name like Johnna. 

I am not a fan. I have a few reasons. 
1. I have always felt that I never wanted to have a ""junior."" 
2. My boyfriend's name is ""unique"" in that I've only ever known one person (my age) with his name. Like, he is John. That's HIS name. My family has never repeated names so to me, it feels like a person's name is important to each individual. 

My boyfriend's response to my counterarguments is that 1. None of the Johns in his family have technically been ""juniors"" bc they had different middle names. 2. He would be fine with the kid going by their middle name. There are two other Johns in his extended family rn but they both go by their middle names.

I suggested that instead we choose an individual first name & use John as a middle name. He said he really wants John to be the first name.

And his overall argument, which I do understand, is that we have a long-standing agreement that if we disagree on something, the person who cares more wins (this is not hard-and-fast but it generally works for us).

When he first made that argument, I thought about it and said fair, because to him it's a tradition he wants to keep going, and to me it's just an opinion.

But I've thought about it more and more and brought it up again, bc I think I actually do care at least as much as he does here. I have thought about baby names my whole life & while I don't have tradition as a foundation, it's still my future kids NAME and I don't want to yell JOHN & then have to clarify if I mean little or big.

I have a list of baby names that we both love & I'd just rather pick a name we agree on & is individual to our child(ren). I don't know if we'll have more than one (it'd be two max) so an obvious compromise would be naming one John and the other something we picked out together. But again I just really want all my kids to have their own names.

Also, our kid(s) will have hyphenated surname so it's not like it would be another John [bfs last name].

AITA here? My family has no naming traditions so maybe I just don't totally understand the sentiment behind it. I'd love to hear opinions.

EDIT: idk if this is relevant but maybe it is ‚Äî I am not at all opposed to sentimental names. For example, my bf had a brother who passed away and I would actually really love to name a child after him, both to remember his memory and bc I love the name. Bf likes the idea but I personally wouldn't want to end up with one kid named after his brother and one named after him. Because 1. Then we'd be just straight up copying his parents and 2. Their two names together is the full name of a very, VERY famous person and we'd get jokes about it literally every single time we said their names. So kinda feel like we'd have to choose between using his brother's name or using his own.",2020-10-28 15:36:19,188,373,0.93,4,29,39,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I find that extremely illogical and that it‚Äôs pretty bad that she‚Äôs been lying this whole time. She‚Äôs been hiding $25k dollars from me. I put my money into our joint account, since we both agreed to merge our finances. She‚Äôs now saying that I can also put 10% of my income every year into my own account.
 
I then threatened to take 40% of my income(4 years times 10%) and put it into a separate account just for me. She‚Äôs now saying that‚Äôs financial abuse and called me an asshole if I did that.

I (21f) met my stepmom when I was 6 and I'm not sure why but I never liked her. I acted out for a year, my dad nipped it in the bud and I treated her better after that.

Like I would never call her mom and I did not want to be adopted by her ever. Other than that I let her do her thing and I did appreciate that she cared and that she and my dad were happy but on a personal level she is not someone I would have chosen to have in my life.

Over time the dislike went and it was placed by more of a neutral indifference that is still there today. I don't love or hate her and I don't like or dislike her. I am firmly in the middle. But I have respect for her.

My grandma, my dad's mom, has Alzheimer's now and recently my dad and stepmom were taking care of her and she started talking to my stepmom, thinking she was someone else, about how I disliked her (my grandma thinks I'm about 11ish) and how she (grandma) was the person I would confide to so I wouldn't get in trouble with her or my dad.

My stepmom confronted me on it and was naturally upset. She wanted to know if it was true and told me not to lie, so I didn't, and I admitted her I disliked her through most of my childhood. She then asked me if I loved her now and I replied that I respected her and appreciated what she had done for me and for making my dad happy.

She was devastated which I understand completely. Now she's mad and so is my dad. They're mad that I don't like her and they're mad that I actively disliked her for most of my childhood.

So we had money saved for this purpose in our savings account. The older two went to the same private college I went to. It cost a lot of money, but my inheritance and our savings helped greatly. Our oldest is now pursuing a PhD program that is funded by the school.

A year and a half ago, our middle child was diagnosed with a very serious illness. Even with insurance, we are currently 160k in debt. 

Then, the virus happened and my wife lost her job and my income has been severely reduced. 

And as much it pained us, we had to use up our savings just to keep us afloat. The bills are still piling up and every single penny coming into the household is going right back out. This included the money we intended for put youngest's college.

My wife did a lot of legwork and was able to help get our youngest child a nearly full tuition scholarship to our state school. He'd be able to attend from home. 

But our youngest wants to go the same private college even though we've tried telling him the reality of our finances for half a year now.

As a last resort, we looked into loans but we were rejected due to our current debt.

We can't even sell our home and downsize because the house market has tanked where we live. And more importantly, our son is severely immunocompromised so moving around isn't the best idea.

Our youngest became extremely hurtful to us and we found out that he's been blaming his brother to his face that he can't go to his dream college because of him.

My wife and I ended up putting our foot down and said we are sorry but sometimes a family member needs more help at specific times in their lives.

We then told our youngest that in a few years if we've recovered financially, we'll pay his grad school in any school he wants. But we couldn't promise him outright because none of us know what the future holds.

Our youngest has confirmed his acceptance to the state school which is an excellent school. But he has now completely cut himself off from the rest of us at home.

He hasn't talked to us in a month now. My wife and I are heartbroken. We can't even afford any sort of family counseling.

Our middle son is extremely upset as well but this is guilt he should not be shouldering.

I've just been feeling like a failure as a parent. AITA?",2020-08-10 12:36:04,2858,9194,0.97,17,127,48,1,,,,,3,1,6,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,

I see these kids every single day due to how close I live to their home and I'm basically their nanny.

For some unfathomable reason their parents got Jack really into videogames from a very young age and all he likes to do is watch Lets Plays constantly. (I'm not sure its healthy for a 5 year old to be that into fortnite but hey not my kid not my choice) He knows I also play a lot of games and just goes on and on talking about them to me and subsequently asks a lot of questions.

One day he was telling me about how his favorite youtubers were playing Five Nights At Freddies and how cool and scary it was and he asked me if animatronics were a real thing.

Thinking nothing of such a simple question I said yeah, the game itself is based on the real life franchise called Chuck E Cheese. I also off handedly mentioned that Disney makes some of the best animatronics in the world.

This blew Jack's mind and he went to watching all sorts of ride videos on youtube about the different rides in Disneyland that had animatronics in them and even started pointing them out to George and explaining to him how ""animatronics are robots that look real"".

Their mom found out about what I had told Jack and got pissed off because she and her husband were planning on taking the kids to Disneyland soon and now the ""magic is ruined"" since he now knows that everything is fake. She thinks Jack, being the little chatterbox he is, will ruin it for other kids as well.

I don't think I ruined his potential experience by inadvertently getting the kid interested in robotics in the entertainment industry. If anything I think I made him more excited than ever by the concept of theme parks and their inner workings.

AITA?

Edit: For people asking about why a 5 year old is watching FNAF

His parents give him unfettered access to youtube with ""child safety"" features on so I guess as long as the Lets Player in question doesn't swear in their videos then it passes the filter? I've seen him watching lets plays of other similarly scary games such as Bendy and the Ink Machine, Little Nightmares, and Dark Deception. Its a load of annoying hypocrisy that they let him watch that kind of stuff but then also get pissed when I tell him things like about all the various dangerous animals in Australia and claim I gave him nightmares about cassowaries.",2020-10-01 23:20:03,296,4139,0.98,2,18,147,0,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have never been close with my family for numerous reasons, so when I found out he loved his family so much, I was thrilled. 

We married this past June (COVID weddings- yay!), after a short engagement. His youngest brother (M16) was present to witness the union. 

His oldest brother- let‚Äôs call him Dylan- (M24) was not present. He had since been at training for the Reserves and, since we chose to celebrate the marriage til a later date, not notified until he received phone privileges.

Well, Dylan graduated in October and made a beeline to come home. I had briefly met him a couple of times, but not enough to truly know him. My MIL hypes him up all the time about how great he is and how far he‚Äôs come, which I understand, and I was ready to truly get to know my BIL better since he would be visiting his family while staying with us. 

Dylan came to our home while I was at work one day. I came home to my husband playing video games with him. I tried to be polite and make small talk, but he didn‚Äôt seem interested and looked more into his game. I shut up. 

The week went on and I distanced myself to let the guys have their ‚Äúbrother time.‚Äù It had been six-ish months, and they had similar interests I had no part in (sorry, just not a big anime/video game person). I felt like Dylan would get weirdly quiet when I was around, and the energy he gave off didn‚Äôt sit right with me.

While I distanced myself, I tried to be a good hostess. I sat with them and we watched a movie (Signs) one night and even cooked him dinners. Now, I get he was six-months-deprived of real food, but a ‚Äúthank you‚Äù would have been appreciated. I shrugged it off and prayed the week would pass by, Dylan was slowly getting on my nerves. He would interject his opinion at the worst times, speak directly to my husband and not myself, and hardly made any conversation with me. I tried, but his body language made it clear that he was not keen in getting to know me. I was hurt, but whatever, he lives out of state anyway. 

My husband thinks I didn‚Äôt try hard enough to get to know him. 

I could be the asshole for not grinning and bearing my BIL‚Äôs stay, or for not starting multiple conversations. I legitimately did try to pry at him, though.

Well, Christmas is fast approaching, and Dylan‚Äôs recently purchased his first house. My husband asked Dylan for a PS5 for Christmas (which he can afford), but neither mentioned me. 

I‚Äôm fine with that, but what irks me is that my husband asked what Dylan planned on getting me, to which he stated that he didn‚Äôt plan on getting me anything since he has a mortgage and that he would be getting both of his brothers PS5s and gifts for his parents only. 

Dylan told my husband that he likes me just fine when hubs asked him what he thinks of me, but I feel like his actions are speaking for him.

Am I the asshole for thinking I should at least be considered?

EDIT: my husband recommended gift cards to him for a suggestion, to which he had the same reply/excuse.


EDIT: to everyone saying I‚Äôm an asshole because I ‚Äúexpect‚Äù a gift back, I don‚Äôt. My husband asked him what he wanted for Christmas, and he said nothing- but we are still giving him a $250 giftcard to a home store (Lowes, Home Depot, Homegoods, etc). That‚Äôs how the topic came up. My husband just asked him what he was getting me, and he said nothing, and my husband told me what he said. 

The problem is that he so bluntly told my husband he would get something for everyone, excluding me. It only bothers me bc he‚Äôs being inconsiderate.",2020-11-26 04:31:06,55,68,0.91,2,3,13,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now, my job has announced a virtual work option will be permanent, so I immediately set out to get a cat. 

I share a two bedroom house with a roommate, so I first checked with them and asked if it was alright if I got a cat. 

She was totally in on it and said she loved cats and that would be just fine, but that it desperately broke her heart to go through losing a pet, so if I was going to introduce a pet into the home I should be sure to get a kitten so she (my roommate) would be moved out by the time the cat passed away. 

Well, who doesn‚Äôt love kittens right? No problem. 

So, off I went to the pound to do a meet and greet to find the right kitten. Then... I was chosen by a senior cat. 

This may sound silly, but this cat really seemed as though it selected me. Before I knew anything about him, even his name, it was like, ‚ÄúOh, look, there‚Äôs *my* cat.‚Äù No comparison between my chemistry with this cat and the others present, including the kittens. 

Major caveat ‚Äî he‚Äôs eleven. I did seriously consider this and the agreement we had made. But I didn‚Äôt want to pick a pet, a tremendous responsibility and daily presence in my life, based on the opinions of my roommate who wouldn‚Äôt be doing any of the pet maintenance and who could move after any six month period. 

My roommate is very frustrated I violated the terms of our agreement. She says she feels she now cannot form a relationship with the cat or enjoy his presence because as soon as she becomes attached to him she‚Äôd have to go through the pain of the loss and it isn‚Äôt worth it. 

He‚Äôs a total goofball and loves affection, so now I feel bad I‚Äôve created a situation where my roommate is stressed and where my cat is constantly seeking affection from one of the two humans in the house and getting snubbed. 

Plus, of course, we had an agreement and I broke it. It‚Äôs complicated because I feel it may have been justified in breaking it, but the basic fact is we had an agreement and I broke it. 

Better or worse, please be honest with me.

I was in a hurry because I was leaving in 10 minute.
I asked him if his phone needed ""this charger"" or ""that charger"". But before I was done asking he said ""I'm gay"" I went ""oh, oh, cool"" (in a supportive tone) then I asked wich charge he needed, let him borrow it. And I had to leave.

When I came home about 2h later, my mom said that my step brother was disepointed that I didn't react stronger. I obviously said sorry and told him that I was completely fine with him being gay and that I was supportive.

Last week I (27f) did something terribly embarrassing that could negatively impact my boyfriend‚Äôs (30m) job. I‚Äôm too ashamed to tell people I know so I‚Äôm depending on the kindness of strangers for their input and possible solutions. I‚Äôll try to stick to the important parts because I tend to ramble but I‚Äôll edit the post if more info is needed.

When the pandemic first hit I was temporarily out of a job but then able to work again, but at a reduced schedule which meant less money. Eventually I lost my job and I couldn‚Äôt even collect Unemployment because the paperwork was still being ‚Äúprocessed.‚Äù I still had some savings and being able to not worry about Student Loans was a big help but I was still drowning. My boyfriend, being the amazing person that he is, told me to move in with him to save money and even helped me sell some of my stuff.

I tried to keep my head up because I knew that no matter how bad I felt I knew someone else had it worse but one day I just broke down. I was stressed and depressed and when my boyfriend came home he started to comfort me. I started to vent to him about my frustrations not really expecting more than for him to listen. After I calmed down a bit my boyfriend went upstairs and then came back with ring and proposed. I started crying again but for different reasons.

We‚Äòve been engaged since July and I‚Äôm still over the moon and since I have a lot more free time I‚Äôve been doing the cooking, cleaning, and shopping while my man works in his office. When he‚Äôs in his office I know not to disturb him until after 6PM unless it‚Äôs important and to just text him. Last week he had a very important business meeting through Zoom during his last hour of work so I made sure to be extra quiet.

At 6:30PM, thinking that he was off the clock and just doing extra work I walked in with a plate full of food while wearing something NSFW and asked him if he wanted me to ‚Äúpolish the Dragon Balls‚Äù before or after he ate. My fianc√© stared horrified and I heard a voice from behind request that I do that later. Turns out his meeting ran a little late and I jumped down and scurried away on all fours. My fianc√©‚Äôs is going into to the office for a meeting with HR and I feel like I‚Äôve messed up royally and don‚Äôt know what to do. I have a lot of regrets and now I just have to ask AITA for assuming my fianc√© was done with his meeting instead of checking?

Edit for clarification: Thank you for the comments but since I‚Äôm starting to see a pattern I just wanted to clarify.

1.  My fianc√©‚Äôs job was always good at ending at 6PM and never really went over before
2. When I walked in I was quiet, my fianc√© wasn‚Äôt talking and I initially didn‚Äôt hear any voices so I thought everything was good.
3. The office is set up so that the back of the computer is facing door so I couldn‚Äòt see the screen either ",2020-11-06 03:29:59,119,202,0.89,14,31,9,0,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lots of beer and lots of hook ups where we didnt even know each other's names. I was dealing with lots of damage, to the point where I dont even remember most of those years. Now at almost 40, I''m much better now, with therapy and AA and my saint of a wife, but thats the important background. 

I was clear with my wife that its quite possible I have some kids out there somewhere, though a lot of the women I slept with I have no way of contacting to be sure. My wife budgeted in some savings for if we ever have to pay child support for a couple of kids, but just asked that I get a paternity test before we welcome them in. We have no kids of our own, dont really want any. 

Last year, a 16 year old boy contacted me, saying that I was his father. We'll call him K. K claimed to be the son of one of my old classmates, and that his mom had raised him by herself because she didnt want to cause any trouble. But she had told him about me, all the time, and he had spent a lot of his life googling me. He'd finally worked up the courage to contact me, and asked if we could me. 

Since I can neither confirm nor deny sleeping with his mother, I agreed to meet between our two towns, me driving about 5 hours and him driving about 45 mins, though I did tell him about my wife's request. He was fine with it. We met after the kit got here, he did the spit thing, gave it back, and we sat, talked, had lunch, and drove back home. 

We were not a match. I had my profile done a while ago, just so it was out there in case any kids found me that way. But K and I are not related. I contacted him, gave him all his data, and let him down gently. 

He was devastated. Crying, claiming it wasnt real, that he had spent his entire life idolizing me, that I had to be his dad. He begged to have a relationship, but I'm not entirely interested in building one with a random child. I apologized again, but left it at that. 

His mom reached out, begging me as well, saying that she was so sure I was the father, that its destroying him not knowing who his dad is. I said it was a real shame, but that father isnt me. I'm not dad material, especially not for someone else's kid. 

This just came up in a convo recently, and sparked an argument. Some say its fine, others say it was cruel to abandon a kid who spent his entire life believing he was mine. Am I the asshole here?",2020-08-10 08:51:18,1849,20273,0.96,0,108,316,0,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I‚Äôve never come to reddit for judgement before this but I‚Äôm at my wits end so here goes; 

My sister, let‚Äôs call her Blair, has lymphoma. Her situation‚Äôs been deteriorating and there‚Äôs little to no chance of her surviving this. Doctor‚Äôs say it‚Äôs only a matter of time before the inevitable. Blair has a three year old son with her ex boyfriend, who‚Äôs not in the picture anymore, i.e Blair has full custody.

I‚Äôve never really been close to Blair, mostly because of our age differences (she‚Äôs 40 and I‚Äôm 31) but I‚Äôm close to my nephew. Two days back, Blair asked me if I would be willing to legally adopt her son after she‚Äôs gone. It was obviously a very hard thing for her to say and I totally understand her desperation to make sure her child would be okay, but this request came as a shocker. 

As far as I know, this particular .. situation had been discussed before between her and our parents, and they‚Äôd agreed to take care of [nephew]. She explained that our parents are too old (both are in their early 60s) and she doesn‚Äôt want to burden them with the responsibility of taking care of a child in their old age. Fair enough. I told her that I needed some time to think about it. 

First off, my husband and I already have two kids (aged 4 and 1) and it‚Äôs a hassle to take care of them even without adding another child to the mix. I don‚Äôt think we can handle another. Then, our expenses. I‚Äôm a SAHM and he‚Äôs the only one who earns; so we‚Äôd be fucked financially. My husband also isn‚Äôt entirely on board because of his own reasons, which is fair because this needs to be a mutual decision. I love my nephew, I really do, but I don‚Äôt think I can do this for him.

My wife has a bit of a complex medical history, which her ex is familiar with. She‚Äôs had to change doctors several times because she tends to get ignored because several of her health concerns are fairly rare. She thinks he‚Äôd be a much better fit for her medical care, and would like to become his patient. I told her I‚Äôm not comfortable with that, which she thinks is childish and insecure. 

On the one hand...
She typically goes to the doctor like 4-5 times per year, so it isn‚Äôt like she‚Äôd be seeing him all the time. I don‚Äôt feel worried that she‚Äôd cheat on me with him - I believe her when she says that she just wants better medical care.

My partner has always had his heart set on naming his first born son after his late grandfather. He was always very close to his grandfather growing up and by all accounts it sounds like he was a really lovely, family man.

Sadly his grandad passed away when my partner was 16, it was the hardest loss of a relative he has ever been through and he‚Äôs always been honest about wanting to name a child after him. 

Now I have never been fond of the name, I don‚Äôt hate it but I really don‚Äôt love it, it‚Äôs very dated.

My partner knew that I don‚Äôt like the name but I never really pushed back on it until we actually started trying to get pregnant (as up until that point it was all hypothetical) at which point I asked if we could compromise by using it as a middle name instead, my partner was really upset and disappointed and it‚Äôs been a sore topic ever since...

The reason I think I might be TA is because it‚Äôs not like I despise of the name, and I know it would mean the world to my partner (and his family) and I feel a bit selfish saying no... but equally, I would be giving our child a name that I don‚Äôt like and it would be after a person that I have never met! 

I really don‚Äôt know whether to just suck it up because it will make my partner happy or whether to stick to my guns and insist we find a name that we both like and use the grandfather‚Äôs name as a middle name!

TLDR: My partner wants to name our son after his late grandfather. I don‚Äôt completely hate the name but I don‚Äôt like it so suggested we compromise by using it as a middle name. Partner is upset and says there are no other names he would consider calling his son.

My sister married a man who had 3 kids. I'll call him ""John"". 

The mothers of John's kids are not in the picture. The eldest sons mom may have been an illegal and they abandoned the baby with John (they were 15) and they don't even know her identity. The other boys mom passed away when they were babies.

My sister became pregnant and then married him having a baby girl just after the wedding.

When the baby was about 3 months old John had an accident at work and passed away. 

The step children are 16, 8 & 7. 

They had bought a home right before the baby was born. We had told them it was a bad idea but they bought a home that needed major work and ended up having a lot more issues then they thought. But he was very into handy type work and wanted to build it with his own two hands. But obviously didn't get a chance.

My sister was struggling financially. And the home wasn't really in any livable condition, especially not with children.

My parents live in a retirement community and while they are well enough off they can't really afford to support my sister and a mess of kids. My mother suggested/pushed really me to let my sister come stay with me until she can sell the home and get back on her feet. 

The house is a mess and I doubt she will get much for it and right now with all going on in the world who knows how long it will take. 

My husband and I are doing quite well right now and have a nice home with a guest room. I live with my husband and two girls under the age of 5. 

I told my sister that she could come and stay in my guest room with the baby. She asked about the other kids... And I told her there wasn't really enough room for all of them staying for so long. How would 3 boys, one being a teenager, her and a baby all going to fit into one bedroom!? She wanted the boys to stay in our family room. Which I think is absurd as they could be here for months, a year?! Or more!

And she accused me of being racist, which I am not. But I just am worried about having a teenage boy (of any race) that we really don't know in the house. She barely has even gotten to know these kids.

Wouldn't it be more fair for the kids to go live with their actual family who they have known their whole life? I know the grandparents were willing to take the boys in. They just lost their father and are now with a practical stranger and we have barely ever even met them. That has to be harder on them.

My parents and husband agree with me.

But my sister is refusing to even consider. I think she is definitely hurting herself and her baby just to spite everyone and be stubborn. Maybe she has some guilt because of John passing but she needs to be responsible right now and make more logical choices.

The commute will be longer and there are a couple of disadvantages, but the pay will more than makeup for it in my opinion.

When telling my boss the news, he asked how much I would be making and I told him.  He got real quiet and thought about it for a moment.  He then told me that he could pay me $5/hr more than I currently make and would be willing to let me work remotely 2 days a week if I stayed in the company.  Which, to be honest, isn't an awful deal.  But still, I wasn't biting.

I asked him if he thought I was worth that $5/hr raise and he said I was because I am a useful part of the team.  At that, I asked him this.

""If I am worth that much, how come you gave me a $1/hr raise at my last review two months ago?  You're basically admitting that you have been underpaying me and only want to pay me what I'm worth now because I'm leaving the company?""

He somewhat fumed and you could see him get red in the face despite him not raising his voice.  He said something about me not understanding how pay works, how it isn't just his decision, and how negotiations like this are a normal part of the business.

I stood my ground and told him that if he had given me these benefits to begin with, he might have gotten to keep me.  I told him that I wouldn't be able to trust that I was ever being paid fairly going forward.

Well, I put my two weeks in and that's that.  I was telling this story to my parents and my mom suggested that my boss had a point.  That these negotiations are normal and that I should have just politely declined the offer instead of making a scene.

AITA?  


Edit: I did ask for more at my review and argued I'm worth more, but he said he couldn't offer more and that covid has slashed funding all around.  I forgot to bring it up when talking to my boss.

I am a single dad because my ex wife left me and out children due to mental health when my youngest was born. Her parents did help out a bit at first but I haven‚Äôt spoken to the in last decade. I was financially stable when my kids were younger. My ex wife also worked, so money wasn‚Äôt a problem for my boys. Money wasn‚Äôt a problem when I was a single father either earlier on. I made good money for my daughter up until three years ago. I got hit by a car and I still experience physical trauma from it. I can barely walk and have immense back pain. I‚Äôm on disabilities and can barely work. I can no longer afford to send my kid to college without her having to take loans. I brought this up to her and she has told me that it‚Äôs extremely unfair because her brothers were able to go to college without any loans. I have asked my sons to help with her school but they‚Äôve refused as well. AITA

Edit: I just wanted to add some details. One of my son can‚Äôt afford to help out because him and his wife are about to start a family and all of his extra money is going towards fertility treatment. I wasn‚Äôt aware of this before asking. My other son said it isn‚Äôt fair if he pays but the first son doesn‚Äôt pay and basically ‚Äúwhat if my wife needs fertility treatment or I get hit by a car?‚Äù 

I think I may be the asshole because my daughter thinks I can downsize my life style to be able to pay for her college such as selling my car since I don‚Äôt need to go to work, or selling my home and living in an apartment/smaller home or cancelling things like Netflix, internet etc. I refuse to do either. I don‚Äôt think I have to suffer any further. I am wifeless and crippled for life. Is it wrong that I want to be able to drive to get my groceries and for PT? Or that I want to have high speed internet and Netflix?

I can also pay for about 2 years of college for her. I have 20k saved for her college funds. I had about double for each boy

Edit: Thank you for all your comments and advice. There‚Äôs some misunderstandings in the comments that I‚Äôll like to clear.

1) All my children have lost their mother. Not just my daughter. My sons lost her at age SIX. They didn‚Äôt have an easy childhood either. So the idea that they had a picture perfect life while my daughter has some crappy life is incorrect. The first few years without mom was difficult for them that I I put them in counselling. My daughter didn‚Äôt remember her mom but when she was old enough, she was also placed in counselling. 

2) My daughter isn‚Äôt my care taker. I‚Äôm not so disabled that I need a care taker. I am able to drive, buy groceries, shower, cook and do basic things. My sister or sons come over when it‚Äôs stuff l that I can‚Äôt do like mowing the lawn. My daughter does basic chores like dishes, vacuuming.",2020-10-09 00:56:38,259,966,0.95,3,31,74,0,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My sister wanted to borrow it for a class for a little while, so I told her she could, as long as when she was done with it she brought it back in the same condition she took it. I had it completely put away, so obviously that meant to bring it back to me all folded up and neat, so I wouldn't have to do it myself to get it out of the way for later. She brought it back to me still in full standing formation and said ""I couldn't really collapse it. I didn't try for super long, but I figured you could"". 

Now, later she's asked a few more times to use the tripod, and I keep refusing because she didn't do the one thing I asked for the first time. 

My Mom yelled at me saying I won't let one little mistake go, but I think that it's not just the mistake, it's that she didn't try in the first place to collapse it.

Workmate (not a close close friend, but a friendly on Facebook and at work kind of friend) has a gorgeous dog - big chunky bulldog. I am a dog lover and we often exchange stories and advice about our love of dogs.

For context, we work in a project team with a shared mailbox, and often I have to correct her spelling and grammar on official emails - otherwise it makes our agency look inept. Things like ""your welcome"" and ""I hope its not to much trouble"" have to be corrected by myself (as Keeper Of The Mailbox) so the joke is in the office that I am a bit of a pedant.

&#x200B;

Anyway, last week she showed me a sign she created for her bulldog to hang in the house - it was comprised of store-bought letter sculptures that had little lightbulbs inside and you can mix & match all the letters of the alphabet as you buy them per letter (like for kids' bedrooms and such).

&#x200B;

So her sign was ""ZUES"".  


I told her that the letters were lovely and would look gorgeous above his dog bed, but that she spelled ""Zeus"" incorrectly. She looked annoyed at me and stated that ""Zues"" is how they spell it, and she won't change the order of the letters of her signage. I must have looked amused/smug/condescending (or so she thought) as she has now decided to ""not bother"" with the sign and has been quite cool to me at work.

We both come from large families and friendship groups so have around 210 on the list so far, 60 are from his family, 40 from mine and 100 combined friends. We are struggling to cut the number down and also struggling with costs. My parents are putting in 15k and his parents are putting in 10k. His parents did the same for his sister and also explicitly told us that the money is for a wedding only ie if we eloped we didn't get the money.  I offered to them that if they had a special person they wanted included on the list as I wanted to be inclusive and show my respect to my new mother and father in law. They then came back with an additional 14 of their friends they wanted invited, who I have never met and my fiance has only met a couple of them.

I want to say no and limit them to a smaller number like 6 but I appreciate them giving us money for the wedding in the first place so I feel rude.

When they were crossing the street, a car came speeding to the intersection much too fast and slammed on their brakes before the red light but hydroplaned in a deep puddle. 

And I watched in horror as my wife literally sprinted away, pulling her hand free of Jacob's. He was frozen in place like a deer in headlights. The car got traction and swerved to a stop at the last moment and I ran over to Jacob. Emily was a ways away across the street.

I was furious at Emily for running, and I confronted her when we got home and we could talk privately. She started crying and saying she was terrified because her friend in college had been in a bad hit and run and she just panicked and ran. 

I said that I was terrified for Jacob too, how could she run and literally yank her hand away from him? She just kept saying she was so scared she wasn't thinking, and I was saying that I don't care how scary something is, my first instinct was to protect my son.

She stormed out of the house and went to stay with her friend, and ever since she's come back she's been refusing to talk about it anymore.

I am from Europe and I wasn't particularly enjoying living there and had been wanting to leave anyway. 

We spent 11 years in the UK and in 2018 had our first child. Before I got pregnant, my husband told me that he wouldn't want to raise his child there. He was worried about the political situation in the UK because of Brexit and felt he had 'overstayed his welcome'. I never really understood why he felt that way - we were settled happily there, purchased a small house, had a nice group of friends. He had a good job and I was running a small business. The last 2-3 years of our time there he was very grumpy all the time, always making it very known how miserable and unhappy he was being there and how much he missed being in the US. He wanted us to return to Portland after the birth. 

I was very happy in the UK but I agreed that being closer to family was a good idea, that a slower pace would be better for us while our child was little, we could get a big house, his parents would help with the baby and things would be more balanced. He also felt Portland was a booming city now, with a lot of entrepreneurial opportunities and a vibrant tech scene. Reluctantly, I agreed. Within a few months, he orchestrated a move back to the US and a year ago we moved. 

For the first few months I worked really hard to get settled. I missed my old life but I was focused on making this life work. 

Then the pandemic hit. Right at the start, my husband lost his job. For several months things were pretty dire for us but over the summer he got his dream job. Then there was all the turmoil that went on in Portland - police clashes with protestors for weeks on end, a forest fire that left us trapped indoors for more than a week and all the craziness that is going on with the US politically. It is just feeling like too much for me. I am scared about what is happening to this country. I am scared about what kind of place I am raising my child in. I really don't feel safe here and it's really tainting everything. 

I have been telling him that I want to leave. It doesn't have to be back to the UK although that would be easier. I am willing to wherever there are work opportunities for him, as long as we go. 

The last time we spoke about this he reluctantly agreed to the idea of moving but wants to put a 12-18 month timeframe to it. Even though he's agreed, I can tell that is not what he wants. I am worried we'll go and we're just going to end up in the same situation as we were before where he was unhappy all the time. I feel terrible for backing out on wanting to come here, but it really does not feel like we made a bad decision. The US feels like it's completely imploding right now and I don't want to be a part of it.

It's horribly clich√©ed and I am not planning on making any money of off this, it's mainly for fun and practicing my writing skills.

The story is about a 18 year old aristocrat man living in 1889 England who through some kind of miracle (ghosts. It's ghosts.) gets transported into 2015 England.
It follows him growing up and trying to adjust to the new England.
Since he lived in a time where literal human zoos where common he is extremely racist, xenophobic and sexist.
The entire point of this story is him trying to re-adjust  and aquiring new values.

Now, I made the mistake of posting an exerb of this on instagram like an idiot. The part I posted described him talking down to a POC and being confused on why they can talk back and why he is getting hated now. It's a learning moment for him and he's genuinely stumped on why equal rights exist.
It ends in him thinking about his actions and reconsidering his values.

And I got a LOT of flack for this. My comments where filled with people telling me it's gross that I' m writing about a racist. That it's insensitive because I am not black and shouldn't ever write anything about racism. People went through my post history where I posted my entire book so far in little pieces and kept commenting on how bad of a person I am.

Because of this mentality, there is so such thing of separate finances in my household. My fianc√© grew up in an Asian family in America, and doesn‚Äôt really have such mentality growing up.

Last night, I was going over my bank statement and my fianc√© accidentally saw the amount of money I have in my saving. He was so excited when he told me that I can use that money to help him pay for the remaining student loan he has. I told him I can‚Äôt do that, that money belong to my family (my parents and I). Well, he didn‚Äôt understand so I told him that the reason I was able to save up was because there‚Äôs a mutual understanding between my parents and I. I went to a state school near my house so I didn‚Äôt have any student loan, and when I got my job, I still stayed with my parents. My parents would still paid for the rent, utilities, food and such. I would then saved up 2/3 of my salary every month. I also helped out with car insurance and other expenses if needed. Even though the money is in my account, I considered it as my family‚Äôs saving.

He told me that he‚Äôs also my family now, and I should use it to help him out a little. I told him that I need to ask my parents, and even if they agreed, I can only help out a portion but not all. He blew up, saying I was selfish and that this is America, he and I should be a unit, not my parents and I. This is a place where I think I would be AH because technically we are not married yet, and as for now, I don‚Äôt think he can just demand it. Beside, even if we are married, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs entitled to my family‚Äôs saving. It is simply not his money. WIBTA to tell him my thinking on this subject?

Edit: thank you for all your responses. Some people asked if he‚Äôs the man I want to marry, and frankly I‚Äôm thinking about the same thing nowadays. When we were dating, I told him upfront about my family dynamics and he told me he understood. He knew I had some money saved up and put aside, he just didn‚Äôt know how much. He just completely changed after the engagement, I honestly don‚Äôt know what happened to him.

Edit 2: thanks for all your support. Some people asked if my parents had a retirement plan, and the answer is yes. However, considered how we moved to America less than 10 years ago, his retirement plan cannot actually support both my parents. My fianc√© and I currently live with my parents, and my parents didn‚Äôt  ask him to contribute to any household expense because they considered him as part of the family (we didn‚Äôt ask him to save his money or anything though, he can do whatever with his money). That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs really shocked me when he didn‚Äôt consider my parents as part of our family. I am rethinking about our whole relationship now.

Edit 3: I know the notion of putting money aside for your parents sounds odd. Let‚Äôs me be a bit clearer, my parents never think that the money is their alone, I can use it freely if I want to. It‚Äôs for the future, and if I choose to use it for his debt, they wouldn‚Äôt mind as long as I discuss with them. They would even use their own savings to help out if need. If he asked and discussed it with my family and me instead of berated me, I am confident that we can work something out.",2020-09-18 01:52:02,303,5412,0.99,1,12,159,1,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It really showed when it came to gift giving. One year M got a dirt bike for her birthday, the same year i got a beanie baby. At 12 M got karate lessons, at 12 I got a book ""fishing for dummies"", Graduation M got a car, mine she bought me celebration lunch. You get the idea. M was not clueless about this and was happy to share her nice gifts with me. 

One year when I was 9, M got a telescope for christmas. I thought it was the coolest thing ever. I wasn't even mad that i didn't also get a big present, M and I spent a few months playing with it together. She eventually lost interest, but would let me take it out on clear nights by myself.I was not able to peruse astronomy or learn more about it at the time but i was absolutely facinated. 

Two years later, G got M another MUCH nicer telescope. It was in the $800-1000 range. M was a teen and ended up throwing a huge fit because she wanted a computer. It became a really sore subject, and she hid the telescopes away for over 10 years. I almost forgot she even had them till 3 years ago, she pulled the nice one out and we had a wonderful night looking at stars and planets. I've wanted to pick it back up as a hobby, I hinted about borrowing it or going out together more often, she told me that she dosen't find it as exciting as she used to. 

At the beginning of May, M gave me the first telescope. I was excited, but after looking it over I discovered it was in really poor condition. She had left outside for weeks at one point, stored poorly, missing lenses and stand, and it's super dirty. I want to fix it up, but I'm hurting financially because of covid. I've only taken it out of the box once to look it over, as it's unusable till I get at least a stand. 

A few weeks ago we had some stellar weather, and we live near a dark sky park. I asked M if i could borrow the telescope for a weekend. She got weird, asked me what was wrong with the one she gave me a few months ago. I told her what was wrong with it, as well as it being not nearly as powerful as the other one. She got uncharacteristically mad, said she knew it was dirty but nothing was broken or missing. She then starts acusing me of losing and breaking parts, and that she can't trust me to take care of the nice one and refuses to let me use it. It was unlike her so I dropped the subject.

I suspected something happened to it, she sold it or lost it and just didn't want to tell G.  However, i was at her house today and saw the case in the closet, so i know she at least still has it. If it was only broken I feel like she would have told me. She was really weird about sharing it as kids, but we're in our mid 30s now. She's used it less than 10 times, while I would have gotten a lot of joy from it. 

I'm upset by this while also feeling ridiculous for being jealous at my sister for not sharing a gift she got almost 20 years ago. Am I acting entitled to something that is not mine?",2020-11-09 05:28:59,56,217,0.96,3,11,11,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Last year, my best friend F(32) lost her husband M35 very suddenly, I don't think its right to go into detail regarding his death. He died on my (F33) and my husbands (M34) anniversary. Her husband died early in the day and she immediately called me and begged me to come be with her, which I of course did. My husband and I were also devastated, we were all very close.  My husband and I both were upset about having to cancel anniversary plans but that really came second to our friend's loss, so he understood that we couldn't be together on the day, but later once my friend was okay with being alone and everyone had a little breathing room, my husband and I did something small to celebrate.

Fast forward to this year. My friend still struggles with her husband's death obviously but is overall doing much better. She's in therapy and is starting to move forward. However, as I know from my own losses, the first year is the hardest, and the first anniversary is particularly brutal. Next week is the anniversary of her husband's death and she is struggling of course. It also is a big anniversary for my and my husband, 5 years! and we've made some plans (obviously nothing big because of COVID, but we can still make some great food and spend the day). However, in the past week or so my friend keeps bringing up what she and I will do on the anniversary, it barely seems to register in her mind that it is also my husband and I's wedding anniversary, even though she certainly knows as she was in the wedding party. She really doesn't want to be alone on the first anniversary of her husband's death which I can understand, but she never even asked me. She has just made the assumption that we will spend the day together (we're in the same COVID bubble).

I've spoken to my husband about it and obviously, he would like to be with me on our anniversary but he's said that he would understand at least this year if I chose to spend the day with her. Personally, I am super conflicted. She's my dear friend and I know how hard this has been on her, but at the same time its also a day my husband and I are supposed to be celebrating. I know that this day will forever be weird and bittersweet, but I'm worried about my anniversary always being in conflict with her loss. I really do not know how to navigate this, and I can't tell if I am being selfish by wanting to spend the day with my husband.

WIBTA if I told my friend that I was not going to spend the first anniversary of her husband's death with her?

EDIT: I've been reading all of these judgements, and it seems that the consensus is I should spend part of the day with my friend and the night with my husband which is something I had considered but was worried that wouldn't be fair to either party. However, after reading a few perspectives, including the YTAs, I think that spending the day doing some of the things she wanted to, and then trying to find a little celebration with my husband later is the best route. 

As for my friend I will make sure she knows she is fully supported, and I will speak to her and maybe some of the other people in our bubble to 'tag me out' if she doesn't want to be alone at night.

They were the greatest pets, and I loved them all. Especially in my troubled teen years, they were more of a comfort than I ever realized. This past year, my last rat passed away. I was absolutely heartbroken. We were staying with family at the time while we waited for our new place, so my wife promised me that we could get more rats once we were settled in our new place. We‚Äôve been in the new place for a while now, and while our landlord doesn‚Äôt allow pets, she was aware that we had a rat and said she would be okay with small animals such as rats. I‚Äôve been struggling lately. Up until this year, I‚Äôve always had some sort of animal companionship. I didn‚Äôt realize how much it would affect me until a little while ago. My first thought was to try to get an ESA dog, but apparently the last tenant who did that didn‚Äôt get his lease renewed by our landlord. So that was an absolute no from my wife. And we can‚Äôt have cats because she‚Äôs highly allergic.

So I brought up getting more rats, and suddenly my wife doesn‚Äôt want them. She says she‚Äôd rather have a hamster, and I‚Äôm sure hamsters are great, but they‚Äôre not the same as rats. From what I‚Äôve seen and heard, rats are much more social, which is something I need in a pet. 

But I kind of feel like a dick for refusing to budge on the rats. I understand that people can change their minds about things, but it just sucks because she promised me, when I was completely heartbroken over my last rat, that we could get more. So AITA for expecting her to keep her promise?

Also should note, she wouldn‚Äôt be expected to clean their cage/play area or purchase anything they need, it would all be my responsibility. She would maybe only feed them and play with them occasionally.",2020-11-19 16:22:09,50,49,0.89,0,8,10,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My (19F) sisters (Sarah (15F) and Charlotte(17F)) both were given a form of savings account by my parents when they were younger which they get access to when they turn 18 (I don‚Äôt know the full details, but when they applied for this type of account, I didn‚Äôt qualify as I was too old). Charlotte‚Äôs account now has about ¬£2000 in and Sarah‚Äôs account has about ¬£1000. Just to clarify, this money wasn‚Äôt put in by my sisters, but by my parents. Charlotte‚Äôs account has more as they intended to give me a share when she turns 18 and gets access to the account, to make up for the fact that I don‚Äôt have an account of my own. 

I found out recently that my parents decided I would be getting about ¬£500, leaving Charlotte with ¬£1500 and Sarah with ¬£1000. I have to say that I was disappointed when I found out- I was under the na√Øve assumption that the money would be shared equally so we would get about ¬£1000 each. I spoke to Charlotte about it and although she wasn‚Äôt necessarily rude in response, she said that she had no intention to share it equally. I‚Äôm currently at university, therefore this money would be really helpful to cover the cost of my accommodation, but I know that my sisters are also planning on going to university so I know that the money will be helpful for them as well.

They had an accidental pregnancy right before I started college and used what they had saved for my college on the new baby and some other things.

That upset me, but what bothered me more was that my older two siblings had their tuition fully covered. I thought it was unfair then and still feel that way, but I probably could have gotten over it if my parents had acknowledged that what they did was wrong and apologized or tried to help me in some way. Instead of doing either of those things they tried to justify what they had done by saying it was never their responsibility to pay for my college. They didn't believe I had a right to be upset.

Our relationship deteriorated quickly after that point. I was upset and said a lot of hateful things. I won't say they responded in kind, but what I said soured the relationship and they pulled back from me. I was mostly no contact during college but maintained some relationship so I'd have a place to stay when I was on break. When I graduated I told them both I didn't ever want to see them or hear from them again. I went on to grad school and have lived out of state since that point until I moved back earlier this year.

For the most part my parents respected my boundaries and didn't try to contact me other than to wish me a happy birthday or Merry Christmas. I never responded and stayed no contact. When I moved back home, they sent me a message through my sister asking to sit down and try to work out some of our differences. I declined and said I wasn't interested.

My mom has been sick for a while and passed away recently. I thought about attending her funeral, but I decided not to because she stopped being my mom when our relationship ended 10 years ago. I haven't felt anything for her in a long time, so I saw no point in attending. My sisters know how I feel so I thought they'd understand, but they both told me I should go (mostly because they thought I would regret it). I still refused to attend.

Now my sisters have told me I am heartless and an asshole and they don't want anything to do with me. They think that I am toxic because they don't believe anyone that can hold a grudge for so long is a good person. My finance wasn't as harsh, but she didn't take my side and thinks I've gone to an extreme by refusing to accept any olive branch.

I feel like my sisters don't understand. It's easy to judge me when you didn't have to go through the same thing. If they had they would understand.

I'm not sure what difference it will make since my sisters have already decided I'm the bad guy and not worth the trouble, but I will still ask if they are right about me being the asshole for not attending the funeral.

Whenever I feel like I'm stressed and I need a break, I close myself in a room with loud music and dance,sing and basically swing through every emotion I have. I can not express enough how much relieving that is.

I am usually a very controlled, introvert and anxious person, so this habit really helps me relaxing and letting all my emotions out: during a single session I can go from being on the verge of crying to letting all my anger and frustration out (not in a physical sense). Problem is, I am rather shy, so I am not able to completely ""letting myself go"" when someone watch. I do this when I need it/feel like it, but I'd say that it can happen at most once every two or three months, but often I do not feel the need to do this for, like, an entire year or more.

My wife knows this, but 3 days ago she told me she felt excluded because I basically close myself in a room for 2 hours, and the fact she couldn't come in made her feel like I don't trust her, so she asked me if I could avoid doing this, or if she could attend.

I assured her that it's not like I don't trust her, I consider that to be a ""me time"" stress reliever and I don't want anyone to see it simply because it would make me uncomfortable and therefore it would undermine the whole purpose of letting myself go.

She said she understands, but she has been cold with me ever since. So I have to wonder, AITA for wanting a little ""me time"" once in a while?",2020-11-22 15:27:43,29,116,0.93,0,3,9,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shortly after, I had my baby. The entire pregnancy was filled with complications, and the labor wasn't much better. I ended up having a c-section. Luckily baby is completely healthy and perfect, but I am still struggling with recovery. I've had stitches pop, fainted, been diagnosed with vertigo, had my incision infected because the tape was removed too soon, and a whole host of other issues. Even a month later, I can't lift anything over 10 pounds and am not allowed to bend down past my waist. It's frustrating, but I'm in a lot of pain if I try to do these things, so I comply.

My sister (15F) loves kids, despite planning to be child free. Since she goes to online school, my mother works, and our father is dead, she's home more and helps me with the baby. She never has to feed, change, burp, dress, bathe or anything like that. All she has to do is if I have to go to the bathroom, or go somewhere where I can't see the baby, she has to come into the living room, and make sure her dog doesn't try to jump into the bassinet. If the baby cries, she just has to give the pacifier and if that doesn't work, she just waits for me to get done and tells me that she doesn't know why baby is crying.

Let me reiterate, I've never asked her to do anything other than this. She has helped me with laundry, but when we do laundry we do everyone's, so I've washed hers many times with no help. She's gotten annoyed a few times in the past, which caused me to not ask her, but my OB told me even if I don't have to pee, I need to try to at least 8 times a day as a full bladder causes pain and can slow down the healing. Ofc I don't ask her when she's doing class or homework, just in-between classes or after school, but I still get met with how I'm making her act like a parent, how it's ridiculous I can't even take care of my own baby, etc. It's getting to the point that I have to tell her how much pain I'm in, get angry, or cry to just get her to watch the baby for 5 minutes while I pee.

Today, she was basically saying that I do nothing for my child and she is the only one that watches them. All she does is sit on the couch, play on her phone, and cuddle the dog while I pee. That's it. She's not even holding them or anything.

I didn't want her to feel like I was making her be a parent, but I legit don't have another choice unless the dog is locked up all day until my mom comes home from work because I can't even bend over for enough to lock and unlock the crate since it's a little dog, and it's not like I can hold my baby while I'm trying to wipe or wash my hands. Am I being too unreasonable?

Edit: like I said, my sister loves babies and kids and was happy to help, and in return I'm doing more things for her like cooking, doing her laundry, helping with homework, etc

Edit 2: I'll be asking my sister if a baby gate to keep her dog out of the living room would be okay with the dog's anxiety. She doesn't get anxious in the crate where she sleeps, but I'd feel bad if she had to stay in there most of the day

Edit 3: It turns out my sister doesn't have a problem watching the baby. She just is worried I'm going to die of complications from labor and it'll be my baby's fault, so she doesn't want to get too attached to the ""reason"" I might die. I'm going to talk to my mom about having a family ""open mic"" kind session so she can feel heard and express her concerns.

There are four of us who are quite close: me, L (M31), and then T (F31) and V (M33), who are a couple.

L is 'Uncle L' as far as my dog is concerned. He came with me when I adopted the dog, looks after him when I can't, and adores the dog.

T and V have interacted with the dog a few times, but quickly got bored and annoyed with him. They said that they did not want the dog to come to our social events or on our trips (as we often go on long daytrips as a group). I have respected their wishes and have left my dog at home when we get together.

However, this means that I have had to decline some invitations for outings and trips when I can't arrange alternative care for my dog. I knew from the start that this was a natural consequence of dog ownership, but T and V have seemed insulted that I won't ditch my dog to hang out with them, although they also complain about my restrictions when I DO leave the dog at home (e.g. if I can only come by to pick them up in the car around 10am for a daytrip, as I want to give my dog at least 2 hours exercise before leaving him alone for the day).

Anyway. The triggering event is that I recently bought my own (used) car, primarily to transport my dog around the city, but it also opens up a lot of new possibilities for our travel-inclined friend group. Previously we'd just rented cars for the day, always with me driving, which was fine, but renting cars gets expensive, and the car shares in our area have mileage caps and rules against driving across borders (we live in Europe) that significantly limit our range.

The first weekend after I got the car, I was excitedly talking about all the day trips and weekend trips that we could do now that I have the car. V then asked me what I would do about the dog. I said, well, ideally, I'd like him to come with us on more active/outdoors trips, but otherwise, I have other friends who can dogsit. V said clearly ""I don't want to travel with the dog."" Which was annoying, considering it's my car and I'm the one driving us (as always), but whatever, I got the hint.

What annoys me is that *this* weekend, T and V have left for a week-long roadtrip in a neighbouring country (against strict COVID rules btw) with another couple... *and* that couple's dog. They've posted stories on instagram with the dog, including captions like ""road trip with the best doggo!"", with lots of pics of the dog. It bothers me a lot that they explicitly exclude my dog from trips that *I'm* driving them on, while seemingly having no problem spending a \*week\* on a roadtrip with another couple's dog.

Worth noting that my dog is not especially ill-behaved; he loves long car rides and sleeps though the whole drive. AITA for being annoyed at this?",2020-11-17 19:30:58,51,55,0.86,1,11,15,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Point is that he's walking in and out in the buck while she's in there. He's in middle school now. He doesn't think much of it.

I mentioned this to my wife and she shrugged and said its not uncommon in her culture to do those things for kids at that age. She said moms even go into the boys locker room (she is Swedish) and that Americans are uptight. 

I told her regardless, he's too old.

UPDATE: Last night was the last straw. While my son was in the shower, she brought him a warm towel from the dryer. Like 20 minutes later, I walk by his room and he's buck naked next to my wife looking at his new aquarium. He was just telling her things that his fish did.

I spoke to my son and said he's too old to be walking around nude around his mom. I told him I would start helping him because it's okay because we're both boys.  He said he preferred. I asked why. He shrugged.",2020-10-30 20:38:01,107,141,0.91,6,9,11,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She's taken up a few hobbies, but nothing seems to really catch her interest. She approached my wife and I about the possibility of watching our 18-month old son during the day while my wife and I are at work. We currently have out son in daycare during the week and he loves it. We've had nothing but good experiences with our daycare center so far so I was hesitant to pull him out. My wife loved the idea of MIL watching our son. It would save us money and time since we wouldn't have to do drop-off and pick up. It would give MIL and our son a great opportunity to bond and give MIL something to do with her time.

I was hesitant to embrace the idea for a few reasons. MIL is older and watching an 18-month old all day takes a lot of energy. MIL is not in the best health and if something happened while we are at work, it could be hours until someone gets home. MIL would also have to live with us. My wife agreed that my concerns are valid, but wanted to at least give MIL a try. So we told daycare that we were pulling our son out for a couple weeks and used up some vacation time we had saved up with them so we didn't have to keep paying while he wasn't there. 

The first week everything seemingly went fine. We would get home from work and MIL and my son would be happy and playing and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I did notice that MIL would rest as soon as we got home, but watching a toddler all day is exhausting so I didn't really think anything of it.

The next week though, I came home during my lunch break and found MIL asleep on the couch while my son was on the floor watching a movie. I woke MIL up and asked what was going on. She said she must have just dozed off for a second but that everything was fine. My son was ok, but I sent my wife a text telling her what happened and that we need to talk about it. 

That night MIL was apologetic about it, saying it was only for a second and that nothing bad happened. My wife wanted to believe her and let her keep watching our son, but I disagree. I told her that I am not risking my son's health just so that MIL has something to do with her retirement. I said we tried it, it didn't work, and that I was going to drop my son off at daycare the next day. My wife tried to convince me to give MIL another shot, but I refused and told her that this is a one-strike and you're out situation and I'm not putting my son at risk.

My wife brought MIL back home and when she got back she said that MIL cried the entire way because she felt I thought she couldn't take care of her grandson. My wife said I didn't need to be so harsh on her and that we could have given MIL another try. I told her I was just looking out for our son and that I would rather hurt MIL's feelings than have our son get hurt.",2020-10-09 16:47:37,166,779,0.97,10,21,33,2,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He asked me to be his best man and I happily said yes.  I stood next to him, helped him day of the wedding and of course, gave a best man speech.  Everything was great and it was a nice day.  Fast forward 6 months and they file for divorce.  

Not more than a year later, he is engaged and planned on having another wedding.  Again, he asked me to be his best man.  Of course I said yes and did all the things a best man does.  I was happy to help.  He doesn't have a ton of friends and he and I have always been close so I told him I would be there for him.  Fast forward another 6 months or so and there were already rumblings they were second guessing things and sure enough, ended up getting divorced, but not before having a child together (she was pregnant at the time of the wedding).   

So here we are, about 1.5 years since his last divorce and wouldn't you know it, he is engaged to be married AGAIN.  His fiance is currently pregnant with his 3rd child from 3 different women. His wedding is this weekend and just last week he asked me to be his best man for his 3rd wedding in almost as many years.  He asked me 2 weeks before the wedding!

As a married man myself, I am having a hard time supporting someone who doesn't appreciate the sanctity of marriage and what it truly means to take that pledge to your partner. At  this point I am not sure if I will be standing by his side for his 3rd wedding.  Some of my family agrees with my apprehension while others are mad at me for not supporting him on his wedding day.

They wanted him to go to a place with property where he could run, we have a few acres, so I sent a message. It was a person that had posted the ad for their friends, we chatted a bit, then she said the couple thought it sounded like a good fit and we arranged a meeting for Saturday morning.

We go and meet the couple and the dog and chat more, play with the pup, etc. They told us that they were just not prepared for how much work a puppy was going to be at their age (they were older), they felt it wasn't fair for him to be living such a slow-paced life when he has so much energy, and that it was physically difficult for them handling him on walks. I could tell that the husband was especially sad to be giving the puppy away, but they still decided it would be best, and he came home with us that morning. Since then, he's been having a blast. He gets along great with our other dogs, the kids love him, he loves running around the property, and has just settled in extremely well for being here such a short time. We have all really fallen in love with him.

Which brings me to today, when the friend emails saying the couple called them to see if there's any way they can get him back. It left a pit in my stomach. I feel so sympathetic to the couple. I could tell that they loved him a bunch, I mean you can't not, he's an absolutely wonderful pup. But we have all fallen in love on our end too. He fits in so well and seems to be really loving it here. AITA if I don't give him back?

With this in mind, i have a son (25 M) who is gay, and is very open about it. He goes for Pinkdot, a Singaporean LGBTQ+ sort of pride festival thing (correct me if im wrong), is in a bunch if LGBTQ circles and he has dated about 5 guys now (last i know of).

Recently (Saturday) i saw him with his boyfriend on the train being really touchy-feely with each other in broad public daylight, and i could see some other passengers being kind of disgusted with it (note that we are a pretty conservative country, and the fact that we have a law criminalizing gay sex makes this whole situation worse).

My brother passed away a couple weeks ago. Before he passed away he and his fiancee were expecting to have a baby. They were really excited about it. Now that he is dead she no longer wants to have the baby and wants to get an abortion.

The most affordable clinic she can go to charges $450. She would also need $160 for a round trip bus ticket to get there (our state doesn‚Äôt allow abortions), plus travel expenses. That‚Äôs not something she can afford right now. 

I don‚Äôt have a problem with her getting an abortion is she wants one. I really do feel bad about her situation and I would lend her the money if I had it, but I don‚Äôt have that kind of money.

I do however have an old Yamaha motorcycle that‚Äôs worth about $1500. It used to be our fathers, so my brother left it to me.

Last night I got home around 1AM and decided to smoke weed before hitting the hay. As I was halfway through my joint I hear my upstairs neighbor scream out the window ""OMG! WHO IS SMOKING WEED!?"" and then their window slammed shut. I just sat there in awkward silence for about 30 seconds feeling bad, put out the joint, and slowly walked back inside. I didn't mean to upset them that much or have my weed smell invade their senses while trying to sleep. At this point, I am going to stop smoking on the porch to avoid conflict and if I see her I will apologize but was I extremely inconsiderate to do that in the first place?

My wife wants to take him because she doesn't want him to be in foster care his whole life and wants to make sure he is treated right. We already have a daughter and both previously agreed we only wanted one child  together. My wife wants to adopt him permanently but I don't want that, I don't want to sound unsympathetic or rude, but this other baby is not our responsibility. Am I an asshole for this? If any additional information is needed please ask, I'm very conflicted on this, our personal lives would be greatly affected by having another baby in the house and I don't want to come off as selfish but I don't want to adopt this baby.


EDIT: post has been up for 5 hours so sorry this is a little late I was trying to answer as many questions and comments as I could and read every comment down below. 
Thank you for all your comments and opinions and judgements, as is the rules I accept the judgement either way. I just want to say, (and I'm sure this is mostly understood already) I don't think my wife is the asshole for wanting this, quite the opposite really, the question wasn't about, ""well if I'm not the asshole then clearly she is"" we can both not be the asshole or we could both be assholes, the question was just if I am, which for the most part the majority agrees I am not but whether my wife thinks so is a different story. Update on that below in this edit.

Some questions being asked, that I've answered, and some with newer information;

The baby boy in question is less than a month old.

Our daughter is 2 and a half.

It would not be a financial issue to take him. It would cause some more stress but ultimately nothing we can't handle.

The mother and the father are both not available to parent the child indefinitely. I honestly have no idea if they are ever able to come back at a later date and claim him, I am under the impression that, no they would not be able to.
As for the reason why they are unavailable I would like to leave those details out, sorry. Just know that the baby will need to go somewhere and the parents can't take him at this current time.

Some people pointed out that by my post it seemed like I thought the only option is foster care, this was my mistake, I just meant the parents wouldn't be able to take him, so he would have to either go to a family member or into the ""system"". Many people made some great suggestions about adoption and the best ways for him to find a good home.

I would be willing to take him temporarily, the only part that bothered me was the permanence of my wife's decision.

I hope I addressed all the questions, if I didn't answer here or you've checked the comments below send me a DM.


UPDATE with wife:
Her original determination was based out of a strong emotional response to the reason the mother is no longer available to take the child, my wife was upset that the mother's actions caused this child to need the care of someone other than the mother, and in that response became adamant in her decision to protect this child because the mother is clearly incapable. She was determined to take him permanently because she was worried about how he might be treated with someone else. I've since talked with my wife some more and we have agreed to temporary custody for now, we are going to take the baby into our home for now and make a final decision later on, this is a compromise we both came to that we both feel is the most fair for the baby and all others involved. We want him to go to a good home, if that turns out to be ours, we shall see.

For our first Christmas (2017), not only did my boyfriend give me a gift, but three of his siblings AND his brother‚Äôs girlfriend each got me a gift. I even got a gift from their dog. I felt so bad that they got me all these thoughtful and useful gifts and I didn‚Äôt bring anything for them (other than gifts for my boyfriend and his parents).

When I got back home I told my parents and they both told me that I shouldn't feel obligated to give my boyfriend's siblings and their partners each a gift; giving a gift to my boyfriend and his parents was acceptable enough.

That was 3 years ago.

Last year, I got my boyfriend‚Äôs two brothers toothbrush heads and hair gel respectively, and the other remaining people items that I don't remember right now because that‚Äôs what they each had asked for.

Now, Christmas is basically in a month and my boyfriend's (26m) mother had texted a groupchat with me, him, his 3 other siblings, and each of their partners, asking to send her a Christmas wish list. That's 10 people to buy gifts for (which includes the parents and his sister's baby) when genuinely, I'm only interested in giving gifts to my boyfriend and his parents. I find it overwhelming to feel like I need to buy each of those 10 people a gift when in the past, I‚Äôve only gotten my sister, my parents, and whoever I got for secret santa a gift.

(Also, his older brother started dating his girlfriend maybe two months ago. I'm not so interested in getting her a specific gift and I don't want her to feel obligated to get me a gift because we've never met. Also, from her perspective, I wonder‚Äîgiven the understanding that she's only dated this man for two months‚Äîif she feels obligated to buy 10 people she may or may not have met a Christmas gift.)

AITA for not being interested in giving gifts to my boyfriend's siblings and their partners EACH a gift? I don't want to give a gift just because I feel like I have to, I want to give it because I genuinely want to. Unless this is what all couples do and maybe I didn't know? (He's my first boyfriend). I would maybe give gifts to his siblings if they were younger and I were pretty close to them and saw them all the time, but I just feel overwhelmed‚Äîeven after 3 years of Christmas‚Äîto feel like I need to buy 10 people a gift when I already struggle getting gifts for my own family.

Edit: Due to the pandemic, I wouldn't be going to his family's holiday party with the immediate family. Anything I would buy them would have to be mailed there.",2020-11-25 08:20:27,42,17,0.91,0,5,6,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He's quite a bit younger than me, so that means it was during the period of time after my father left our family and disappeared. 

He contacted me and wanted to meet me online or even in person if I was comfortable with it. He wrote a really long message about how excited he was to finally find someone that knew more about his father than his mother. According to him he wasn't planned but father stuck around with them for about 3 years before he died. 

I said that it was nice to know that I have a step sibling out there, but that I have no interest in meeting him. He sent me walls of text begging me to talk to him about his father so he can understand him more. I still told him no.

The main reason I don't want to is because my father was an abusive alcoholic asshole. Every time he came home from work, the joy felt like it was sucked out of the house. I really don't feel comfortable typing about it. That's why I don't want to meet the guy. I can't have my father crush another kid's spirit.

She became bed ridden after she fell and broke her femur a few months ago. It‚Äôs healed now, but she still has trouble getting up and stays in bed almost all the time. Her energy levels are low and she is weak and gets dizzy often so it is dangerous to get her up if she‚Äôs having a bad day or is unprepared. 

The other day, a couple of her friends came over. They used to be physical therapists, so they like to get her up even if she doesn‚Äôt want to, and they often try to ‚Äúteach‚Äù me how to get her up even though I live with my grandmother and have previously worked in a nursing home. When they got her up the other day, however, they moved her bed and it messed up one of the power strips and turned off the power to her bed, her oxygen, her lamp, her clock, everything. I believe they also moved the bed without taking the brakes off, because now the bed moves even when the brakes are on which is extremely dangerous when she goes to stand and put pressure on it. I‚Äôm worried that it will slip and she will fall onto the floor. 

I would like to tell them to stop getting her up. They don‚Äôt see her every day, they don‚Äôt know how much she struggles with very basic tasks.

My mother works in a different city, so she's really only home during the weekend. As a result I pretty much operate as if I live by myself, which sometimes includes leaving my laundry in the dryer overnight depending on when they finish washing. Since I leave for work extremely early in the morning, I don't always take my clothes out of the dryer when I wake up.

Anyway, yesterday my mom's boyfriend came by the house to drop off my mom's dog so she didn't have to worry about trying to drive 4 hours home and worry about said dog at the same time. During that time, I guess when getting the dog settled (she sleeps in the laundry room) he noticed my clothes in the dryer and took them out and folded them. 

I'm not saying it wasn't a nice gesture, it's just that I have issues with the guy, and he's still a relative stranger handling my underwear and bras. It's not like I have any sexy underthings, it just creeps me out to know that a man who isn't related to me, isn't a part of the family, and who I had no idea was even in the house to begin with was handling my underthings.

bit of backround, i developed an e*ting disorder when i was around 12, my dad found out last year because i lost so much weight (i went from being a little over 100 to 89lbs in a few months) im seeing a therapist and currently in recovery but he knows i have a bad relationship with food. 

So sunday night my dad bought a 2L of icecream, me being on my period had three bowls. Im not sure how much my sister had, but we both had the majority of what was in the tub. Last night i was about to make burgers for my sister and i for super, my dad came into the kitchen and took out the ice cream tub from the freezer. 

dad: ‚ÄúHoly shi- theres like nothing left in here! jeez you guys are pigs‚Äù

My sister and i were upset from this comment, we both basically just said 

‚ÄúWOW thank you‚Äù

and went up stairs, i took the burgers off the stove because we both didn‚Äôt want to eat after that. He came into my room and i was crying so i wasnt looking directly at him, he said he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt mean it in that way‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat else was he supper to say‚Äù i was yelling/crying, saying he shouldn‚Äôt have called us pigs. He then said ‚Äúwhats the big deal‚Äù and i just wanted to yell at him that i have an e*ting disorder...but i didnt. 

He said he was sorry, but also basically said that my sister and i were being overly emotional/dramatic. I wanted to know if we were actually being over dramatic

edit:
just to add, whenever he buys icecream he normally has some the second we get home, so i genuinely thought he already had some. And it isn‚Äôt abnormal for me to usually have 2-3 bowls anyways, so i never went over what i would normally have.

also another thing, i still very much have anorexia. I only started recovery at the beginning of the pandemic because being underweight puts me at risk. I still have negative thoughts about eating food and about my body, i struggle to eat and the only reason i do is because i dont want to die from covid

final edit: i forgot to add that after that ordeal, my dad said he‚Äôs never going to buy things like ice cream again? Idk if that was true or not, if it is i thinks its kinda harmful, seeing as he‚Äôs basically punishing someone with anorexia...for...*eating*

ive taking that im not the asshole, but that i should be more considerate. I will say that if i were not on my period i wouldn‚Äôt have eaten 3 bowls. Because when i am on it i completely lose my appetite and only crave sweet things and the thought of any other foods makes me feel sick. But jeez, yall really need to learn more about eating disorders and how harmful it is to insult someone with the illness after eating",2020-10-28 18:44:04,133,101,0.87,5,4,26,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm not a good photographer and neither are any of my friends, we don't have professional cameras or even good phones.   


What I have done is ""recreate"" photos that I actually have, but using a fake background found on the internet, and photoshopping in a pic of me that I have taken myself in my house. Like for example I have real pics of me against the NY skyline that are low quality and not flattering. I find pics online of that same angle that look amazing, and take a flattering pic of myself in the same pose inside my house, and then photoshop it.   


Even for the photos that aren't direct recreations, all of them are places that I've actually been to, with a couple exceptions.   


The exceptions are colorful patterned backgrounds. Like it could be a mural or it could be a room with interesting wallpaper. I have photoshopped myself into those even if I haven't physically been there ever because they aren't landmarks or things known to be in a specific city.   


I haven't done any altering on the photos of myself that I photoshop into these backgrounds. So the way I appear in these pics is very accurate. It's just a better way of framing myself.   


Since I have been doing this I have gotten wayyyyyyyy more matches even though my personal appearance hasn't changed.   


Nobody has directly asked me about the pics before, they will ask me things like, ""so I see you have been to New York, how was it?""  


However, one date did end up asking about a pic that was taken in a colorful room. He asked where that room was. I was honest and said I didn't know, I just photoshopped myself into it because I liked it. He then directly asked if I did that with all my pics and I said yes. I thought it would be funny or at worst, a bit quirky but he was really, really angry. He said I was a huge asshole for doing that. I thought that was way overboard because I didn't alter anything about my own appearance. He said it didn't matter and he never would have gone out with me if he knew the backgrounds were fake.

And that it was ridiculous to give a vaccination to children because children weren't sexually active (yes, not all sexual contact is consensual so there is definitely that).

Anyway, when I was 16 I went to the gyne (my mom was in the room) for a checkup, my gyne asked whether I'd done the vaccination series and I said no (at that point I'd also read a couple of articles that talked about girls getting very sick from it) she assured me of its safety, and explained that the people who'd gotten sick were usually around the age when autoimmune disorders starting surfacing anyway. Still didn't get the vaccine (misinformation + I wasn't having sex and felt awkward about the vaccine with my mom there). 

Now (20) I realise the value of the vaccine (now gardasil9) and wanted to get it before lockdown, and have my (15M) sibling get it too (it prevents HPV + related cancers like oral, penile, and anal cancers, and stops men from being carriers). Due to lockdown we couldn't. And now, my mom doesn't want him to get it until next year ""in case something goes wrong."" I then said we would be looking out for our health. And she told me that I was the one who didn't want it in the first place, so I corrected her and said that she told me I didn't need it when I was 12 (because only people who have sex with lots of people need it) and I felt weird about it long after (although I did have the opportunity again at 16, and declined. Which I admitted. But imo, she was the parent, and fully could've given me the vaccine at 12, and then today's conversation would only have been about my brother getting it. I do understand that everyone does what they think is right at the time, and brought it up bc she blamed me). She then told me that I ""always blame"" her for everything/ ""everything is always"" her fault according to me, and started crying. 

AITA?

Edit: to be clear, she doesn't have an issue with us getting the vaccine now, it was perfectly fine that we would both get it. The disagreement came from her suggesting it was my fault I hadn't been vaccinated in the first place, and me bringing up that she made that decision. Which resulted in her saying that I blamed her for everything/everything was always her fault and her crying (for hours). Just so everyone knows there was no yelling, that's a boundary for me. 

Both of my parents keep talking about how I can't take responsibility for my own actions, and how I blame them and criticise them for everything (I hate when people talk in ""always"" and ""everything"" kind of statements but not the point). I feel justified in my stance, and rather emotionally reactive (on an internal level but self control ya know), but am also concerned that I'm fooling myself and am 100% in the wrong.",2020-11-22 09:08:37,33,39,0.87,0,1,11,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I‚Äôve been dating this great guy for 6 years. He is a single father to 3 amazing girls (his first wife died several years ago) 

Before the world went to trash he took me out to a very fancy dinner and asked me to marry him, the girls then came out and asked me to be their mom. And they all presented me with an amazing ring he told me was a family ring. I said yes. 

Shortly after they all went back out west to help his parents settle somethings with the family company. 

They recently came back, finished their isolation and got tested to be safe. And he came to see me as just said that he wanted to talk. 

Well he dropped a bombshell that what I thought was a small family company is actually a million dollar tec company. I was shocked. 

He never acted or looked rich. He and the girls live in a nice standard family home for the area and wear nice clothing but it‚Äôs not like I have ever seen him/the girls/ items in his house that would be considered luxury brands. When we went out we would always sneak snacks into movies, pack a lunch bags Togo,split bills, fly economic etc

He said he never told me because he wanted to find love again with someone that cared about him and his girls, not his money. 

He then went on about how the trip back was really to set up the main house for us. I had already planned on moving with him once we got married so that was not the problem. But now he tells me I can be a house wife and just do whatever I want to be happy. 

I still love him but I feel like now there is so much I don‚Äôt know about him and I want to just put a pause in the engagement and get to know him again. 

I told this to my friends and they all say I WBTA if I did so cause then I‚Äôm confirming his fear that money would play a role in our relationship and that I should understand why he lied. 

He and the girls are already in full wedding planning mode and I don‚Äôt want to hurt them. Especially the girls as they have already lost so much. My friends tell me I should just move forward and if that even asking them to wait would make me a monster since they all clearly love me and I love them.

So WIBTA if I ask to slow things down. I still want to be with him but I feel like I need to get to know this part of him too. But everyone around me is saying to just go forward as normal as to not rock the boat but this feels anything but normal.

Edit: I‚Äôve lost parts as I kept trying to put this all in to words so to respond to many questions. He does not expect me to be a house wife. But I can if I want. I love my job but we have talked about it before that working does not leave me with much time to do the other things I enjoy. He says he just wants me to be happy so if that means I don‚Äôt work and can do for example more volunteer work then he had no problem with that and will fully support me.

Also people say a million dollar company is not that much in perspective. Truth is I don really know still he showed me the net worth and stock info for the company/family/him but I don‚Äôt understand it all. When he explained it again to me he said that if he lost a million dollars walking down a street he would not even bother looking for it. So while I say million I still don‚Äôt really know or understand but that‚Äôs just another problem I‚Äôm having right now.",2020-08-12 21:39:17,1081,6668,0.96,5,126,67,0,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had actually told him my dream proposal so early on in our relationship and he remembered it! Best day of my life.

In the moment I was so happy I barley even looked at the ring cuz at the time all that mattered was I was with him and happy. 

But after actually looking at it I hate it. It‚Äôs everything I hate in an engagement ring and I was honestly surprised at how much I hated it. I do not want to describe the ring because I do not want to hurt anyone‚Äôs feelings that has a similar looking ring! 

I was actually kind of surprised he went in this direction and found myself feeling a little emotional about it. I ended up crying in the bathroom to myself when I thought my fianc√© wasn‚Äôt around. Of course he heard me and being concerned he came in and asked me what was the matter.

At first I tried to play it off that I was just emotional about being engaged but him knowing me so well he did not believe me. He pushed me further on it and finally I just told him I did not like the ring and I was just a little sad. 

He got super defensive about it. We argued and he ended up calling me ungrateful because he spent a lot of money on the ring.

Me (28F) and my sister (26F) are bridesmaids in our brother‚Äôs (31M) wedding. Our future SIL (28F) asked us to be in the wedding and we‚Äôre super excited. Wedding is in two months and with COVID and them buying a house, not a ton of planning for the wedding has been going on ‚Äì they are very go with the flow, whatever happens, happens. But the wedding is at a nice resort in the Canadian mountains, and our bridal dresses are pretty fancy.
 
All this being said, SIL posted in the bridal party chat that she has a friend (who is not a professional) coming in to do our makeup, but that for the most part we‚Äôd be on our own and can help each other out with getting ready. There would be 11 of us, by the way. Sister and I were hoping to get makeup and hair professionally done, but when we mentioned we wanted to go and do that early in the morning and be back with plenty of time, SIL got really upset. We then tried to compromise and ask if a second person can come in and do our hair, because 11 people is A LOT for one person to do makeup for.
 
Long story short, our brother called us and berated us for two hours, basically saying that we have to do what SIL wants because it‚Äôs her wedding, and if she wants one person to do 11 people‚Äôs makeup and for us to do our own hair, that‚Äôs it. He says that this is a ‚Äúgroup‚Äù thing, and we have to look the same as everyone else. Even after we suggested we pay for this hair person to come in and help us out, at no cost to her.

I'm just gonna say that I don't need any takes on my cousin's crime, imprisonment, or his humanity. I simply want opinions on the below matter.

My cousin has been in prison for a long time (12 years), and won't be out for *at least* a decade. He's got a good support system, friends & family. I guess he misses having more people in his circle, because he'd put up an ad on one of those prison pen pal sites about 1,5 years ago. A lady had replied, they'd started writing each other letters, and boom, somehow they became romantically involved. (Important note: the website my cuz was on shows his crime, and his criminal history is also easily searchable with his inmate number. So this lady knows full well what he's in for.)

His mom mentioned a ""lady friend"" to us around last Christmas, and we were amused by the news. A random lady wanting to get to know a random inmate? We also found it somewhat endearing. We do love him and I'm personally unable to believe that he is an evil being unworthy of love.

However, things have escalated. These two are apparently now a couple. They maintain their relationship through letters, calls and visits.

She is now very eager to ""become part of our family"". She's added all of us on social media. She's got 3 kids, and she hopes that we accept them. We're doing a big video call for Thanksgiving, and she wants to be included. She also asked to take part in our annual Secret Santa.

Am I an asshole for being weirded out by their relationship and not being very interested in getting to know her?

Don't get me wrong, she seems like a sweet lady. But just randomly writing inmates and falling in love with them??? Wanting to introduce your children to this inmate's family??? No one else in our fam has any criminal past/present, but she doesn't know that! A lot of guys run crazy game in prison and really play these women. My cousin happens to be one of the good ones, but man, something about her trusting him so much after only knowing him whilst he's in prison bothers me! Also, he's still got a DECADE behind bars. You're gonna write letters for 10 more years (BEST case scenario)?!

I haven't been mean, but I think she senses my vibe, which most of the family shares. I don't know, it just seems so weird to me. But then I feel like maybe I am a complete Grinch, not letting my cousin be happy?

He has said that he's been deeply touched by her, and that it's been a transforming experience to get to know someone new, who's able to see past his horrendous crime. He understands our reservations but hopes that we can ""find it in our hearts to try and understand this unusual situation"".

We're both in our early 50's, no kids.  For the record, I kind of wanted them, but she never did.  We had one early pregnancy miscarriage in our early 30's and then my wife's career took off and we never tried again. 

For the past two years, my wife's periods have been getting pretty irregular.  She says it's menopause.  I'm not a woman or a scientist, so I don't know, but ok, she says it's menopause.  Birth control for us has mostly been the rhythm method throughout our marriage and with her periods now random (sometimes 2-weeks, sometimes 6-weeks) and our low probability of pregnancy age, we are past the point of being really diligent about it.

Fast forward to 2020.  NYC lockdown and, well, a bit more sexy time was had than usual.  The novelty of us both working from home for the first time ever resulted in quite a few more special cuddles over a few period of a few weeks - lunchtimes and afternoons during a ""work from home"" day make the time pass quickly.  Fun time peaked around March/April...

Well - now she hasn't had a period since March and it's September.  That's right, not a single one.  They stopped completely since our few weeks of intensive fun in early Covid lockdown.  She thinks it's menopause finally arrived combined with a lot of work stress (she's a big wig HR manager for a major retailer).  She joked about it when she first notice she was really late (like 8-weeks) and I offered to go to the drug store to pick up, but she was like, no, it's just ""the change"".  For the record, there's a family history here - her youngest brother was born when her mom was 49.  He was not planned.

The only thing is... I think she's starting to show.  Well, sort of and I need to be careful here.  You see, my sweetie is no longer the slender gal she used to be.  She hasn't been for years.  She is still the most beautiful thing in the world to me, but she's somewhat plus-sized these days.  And pretty sensitive about it too.  Put it this way, accusing her of being pregnant if she isn't would be devastating to her - she really struggles with her weight and insecurities.

So - back to the question at hand.  I'd hate to destroy her self-esteem by pointing out just how nicely she fills out her yoga pants these days, but I'm also genuinely curious about the weight gain, the periods ending and the slim, but real chance of being a papa at age 53...

Should I demand she take a test, and would I be the asshole for doing that if she's just gained a few lbs due to not being able to do Zumba during a pandemic?",2020-09-22 15:31:23,274,1049,0.97,11,45,31,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Me and my late fiance (Alex) were together for about 12 years. We were high school sweethearts. We were engaged for around 3 years when he passed away due to an accident (in the beginning of 2020). 

I was really close with his family before everything happened. Once he died, spending time with them was only hurting me with ""what could have been"". I moved to the other side of the city to be closer to my new job and I still talk to them, but not as much as before. 

Few weeks ago, Alex's brother(Ben) came to visit me. He is planning to propose to his girlfriend. I was very happy him. He asked me if he could have the family's engagement ring. The ring Alex gave me was a family ring which had been in the family for generations. Alex's mom gave him the ring when he proposed to me as he was the eldest son. 

I have been wearing this ring for almost three years. It's a symbol that Alex wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. It represents our relationship to me. I conveyed the same. Ben lost his calm and he was telling at me about how it's his family ring and that it belongs to him now that Alex is dead. I told him to get out. 

I called Alex's mom to let her know why I wanted to keep the ring. She told me she wouldn't have minded if I had been married to Alex. But I wasn't, so I am not a part of the family and therefore I should return the ring. She also told me that since I am young, I am going to move on and that it's unfair to hold on to a ring that I will never wear again. Espcially a ring that belonged to her family for generations. It belongs to the family and not me or Alex, as Alex didn't buy it. 

I would have at least considered giving back the ring if few years had passed and I had moved on. I just can't bear the thought of parting with this ring now. 

So, I told her that I am sorry she felt that way but Alex gave me this ring and I am not giving it back and promptly hung up. 

Ben and his mom are spamming my phone with messages and calls about how I am trying to steal their family ring. They obviously think I am an asshole. 

Edit: At first it was just a matter of civil disagreement but as time goes it's getting more heated and lot more yelling and crying from both sides. 

So, AITA?

I always said I didn't want to move into the apartment he lived in (despite being the same size, mine has bigger balconies), so I guess my son always assumed he would be moving in to the other one once his grandfather passed away.

He brought that subject to me a few weeks after the event. He‚Äôs been dating his partner for 8 years and they‚Äôve never been able to afford a place, since rent is outrageously expensive where we live in, and buying a house is almost impossible in our country with their salaries.

However, I showed the house to a friend of mine who is a realtor, and she said that the house could easily rent for over 1500‚Ç¨ and she could get someone to live there ASAP. I am already going to have a comfortable life when I retire, but that amount would basically double my income and I could live a life of luxury.

My son wasn't happy when I told him I was planning on taking my friend's suggestion and renting the house at that price. He says that 1500‚Ç¨ is more than what he and his partner make together as a couple, and they can‚Äôt afford it.

I told him that he‚Äôs still going to be allowed to live with me, so he can‚Äôt really complain and the house is mine so I can do whatever I want with it.

I‚Äôm in my early 30‚Äôs and my wife is in her late 20‚Äôs. We‚Äôve been married for a few years and both work full-time with average paying jobs. We have 2 kids of our own already, both under the age of 3. We own our own home but money has been tight with my wife being out of work for months due to Covid. She‚Äôs just about to start a new job, however work in her industry is never very stable. 

My wife‚Äôs family lives a few states away, and she essentially moved here after finishing college for a job, and to escape their bullshit. Her family is extremely dysfunctional and filled with alcoholics, drug addicts, and complete degenerates. She is the only one that has graduated college and actually made something out of her life. 

My wife‚Äôs cousin had a child at the age of 17, and insisted on keeping him, despite everyone telling her that she shouldn‚Äôt.

There is no indication the mother will ever get her shit together, and no one knows where the father is. 

The kid is around 2 years old now.

She‚Äôs concerned that the child will be destined to a life of misery, abuse, and neglect if he has to stay in his current situation, which I mostly agree with.

We found out the baby was a boy halfway through at the anatomy scan, and I was excited as all hell. I bonded with that little man inside her belly. We were going to call him Gideon, and I talked to him every day, read stories to him, told him all about the adventures we would have once he was here. We did the nursery up, got a ton of clothes, the works.

Well, when my wife presented in labor they did another ultrasound to confirm the baby was head-down, and nobody mentioned anything about the sex even though we were talking to the doctor and the resident saying it was a boy and he has a male cousin three months older so it's perfect, etc.

Labor time comes, my wife is pushing, and suddenly there's a head of hair and screaming, and I'm overwhelmed with emotion until I see that the baby is not, in fact, a boy. My wife cuddles her close but I was just shocked. I was ready to meet Gideon and now this wasn't Gideon. I felt like I hadn't gotten a chance to bond with this new random girl, unlike my wife who carried her for nine months. I stayed for a minute to make sure my wife and baby were both stable, and then I left the room and cried a bit. I was gone for probably ten minutes. However, in this time I missed the cord clamping which apparently happened right after I said I'm leaving the room to get some air. I didn't know this. Nobody told me.

*Now* I am totally in love with our baby (like I said, I never cared about the sex although if pushed I would lean towards preferring a boy and my wife leaned girl). After I had time to process and realize the obvious conclusion that the baby I read to and sang to was still my baby even if it wasn't the baby I pictured in my head, I loved her more than I thought possible. This took all of ten minutes to clear my head. However, my wife has still not forgiven me for not being there for *ten minutes*, which was *after* she had given birth and while was smiling dopily at the baby, in no pain or distress. She's mad that I missed the cord clamping but I don't even think it's that big of a deal. She thinks it's unforgivable that I didn't love the baby the second she came out just because she was a girl.

I left because I knew my emotions were fucked and I didn't want to make any part of the labor a negative experience for her by saying anything slightly negative. Well apparently by leaving I ruined the birth so I lose both ways.

AITA?

Edit: it literally was nearly two minutes before the cord was clamped, I stayed there for a good minute of baby just cuddling up to my wife and made sure both of them were fine before I left. Also, I would have had the same reaction if they told us it was a girl and then it turned out to be a boy. Stop projecting sexism onto everything.

Recently however he‚Äôs been kind of withdrawing from me and our friend group. He says he doesn‚Äôt want to always be doing the same things. But it‚Äôs not like we do EVERYTHING together. We hang out a lot sure but its not every single waking second.

We were talking about where we want to go to college earlier and i said i wanted to go to a school thats nearby so I don‚Äôt have to pay for dorms and risk getting a random stranger for a roommate. I assumed he would say the same, but he said he wanted to go to school out of state. He says he wants to get outside experience on his own.

We obviously wouldn‚Äôt be sharing a dorm or classes, but i also can‚Äôt imagine being thousands of miles away from my twin.

I told him i would look into the school as well and i may apply there next year. He really didn‚Äôt like that and he yelled at me.

Unfortunately, as the case of most idiots who have no business procreating, he made a child.

6-7 years ago my mother mentioned his girlfriend was pregnant in a way she didn‚Äôt say his name so it ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt count‚Äù cuz it wasn‚Äôt about ‚Äúhim‚Äù. I told her I was sorry for that child and hope the mother wises up and runs away with it. She told me I was awful to wish the child without a dad. I disagree.


His daughter was born and my mother sent me pictures. I cried. Such a beautiful little girl born with such awful circumstances. It wasn‚Äôt fair to her. But I couldn‚Äôt be a part of her life. I demanded my mother stop, he was an extension of her and I didn‚Äôt need the reminder in my life. The most I did was reach out to the mother through Facebook anonymously that I hope she sees clearly and gets her daughter away safely before it‚Äôs too late. I wanted to extend myself as a safe place but we were a country apart and, honestly, I would never risk a branch reaching to him as I know most victims return to the abuser several times.


Baby‚Äôs Mom has full custody. My mother now thinks this means I should have a relationship with mom and baby since it‚Äôs been years. 
No. I can‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt want to. It hurts. 
I‚Äôm also 90% sure this is not his only child out there, just the first to nail him for paternity. I can‚Äôt start a precedent of seeing every one of his children as family. 


My family will bring baby up and when I don‚Äôt engage or change the subject because it hurts hearing about her I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm heartless and cold. I‚Äôve even been told, ‚Äúyou think you‚Äôre better than your brother, but here you are denying a child from some sense of self-righteousness. You‚Äôre delusional if you think you‚Äôre a good person.‚Äù 


I‚Äôve been reminded of her recently and once again I shut the topic down. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm awful and cruel and ill regret my choices eventually. Sometimes I see their side and feel overwhelmed with guilt and think I‚Äôm a giant asshole. The child is innocent, but even if he wasn‚Äôt involved I don‚Äôt want to be.

She has asked for my help so I would like to get some different perspectives to consider. 

My daughter E is 21. Her Aunt C sent her a text asking what type of gift card she would like for Christmas. My daughter no longer wishes to receive gifts from her Aunts and Uncles. She feels that she is now independent enough to buy the things that she needs for herself. These people don‚Äôt talk to her all year or know much about her life. Only what gets passed on through  the grandparents. So E feels that informing somebody where she likes to shop so that she can receive an impersonal piece of plastic is kind of dumb. I wholeheartedly agree and could add so much more but let‚Äôs get to it. 

E sent a text expressing thankfulness for the offer. She explained that she had been grateful for all gifts received in the past. She said that as an adult she no longer felt it necessary for them to spend their money on her and that holiday wishes were plenty. The response was a request for her address.  E suggested that they make a donation to charity on her behalf. Nope, you‚Äôre getting a gift. She went on to explain that receiving what amounts to money from them while so many other humans are in need would in fact make her feel bad, and that Isn‚Äôt supposed to be the intent of a gift. She went on to acknowledge that C would feel good by the act of giving the gift, but that in this case, E felt that her discomfort with receiving the gift would outweigh C‚Äôs gratification from giving. Therefore, C is putting her wants over E‚Äôs needs. 

These very well thought out responses only elicited more requests for the address. So, WIBTA for refusing to give the address?",2020-11-21 00:01:18,38,14,0.9,1,4,5,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My Mom Goes Through My texts Without permission, And I would like to have privacy.","Im genuinely curious if im in the right here or if this is one of those things where the child just doesn't understand yet.

so recently my mom has been going through my text messages which I dont like. for instance I was getting a checkup because I broke my arm recently and they were x raying it to see how much better it has gotten. my mom wasn't allowed in the room  so she stayed outside with my phone. I kept my bluetooth head phones on and while they x rayed my arm I heard tapping from my headphones. I knew she was going through my phone and I was slightly annoyed and when I came out of the room I confronted her about it. she said that she was just checking my texts, I told her I didn't like that she was invading my privacy but she just said that she paid for the phone so she got to go through it. I thought that was BS and that I can have some kind of privacy. I know she wants to make sure im safe but im 13 so its not like im doing drugs and stuff lol. in theory what I came out to a few of my friends as gay, or if one of my friends came out to me as gay but didn't want anyone els to know, and then my mom looked and told everyone. I think there are some things that are not terrible that I am allowed to keep private. I know she has good intentions but I am allowed to have some privacy right? idk. I have to delete messages that I wanna keep private and It is really frustrating. at least she could ask to go through them first and not try and do it behind my back without me knowing.

I Think Im the asshole because I know she means the best and this could just be something im to young to understand

parents if you read this I want you to tell me you opinions and I want to know if this is ok or not.

also dont take this the wrong way and think mom is horrible, she is a great mother and we have a great relationship and I truly think I couldn't have had a better mother. sometimes I just doubt the things she does

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit: wow I really appreciate the advice and I understand both sides. on one hand I deserve to have a little privacy and be able to chat with my friends without worrying about my mom, on the other it is good for her to monitor my safety and make sure im doing ok and she has every right to.

I think I am going to ask her respectfully that she should at least tell me she will be looking at my messages so I can be aware of when she is looking.

also it is not that I tell my friends horrible things that would make my mother worry about my health, its just sometimes I like to vent to my friends over text about things I dont feel comfortable of my mother seeing.

have a nice day :)

note: also my phone is heavily monitored so I cant get texts or calls from people who are not on my contacts and stuff so no need to worry about scams and creepy people and all of that lol.",2020-11-19 16:36:06,50,9,0.86,4,10,9,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It started last year when my daughter invited some of her friends over to our house to use the pool. I was downstairs watching a game, and she came in and asked if she could get something from the fridge. I said sure and just to make polite conversation, I asked, ""How's school?

I thought she would've said, ""Good"" and kept it moving, but she started blinking back tears and telling me how hard it was to stay focused on school and studying and sports while her parents were going through a nasty divorce.

Now, mind you. This was my first time meeting her.  I don't remember my words exactly, I just remember reassuring her things were going to be okay, and that just because her parents were going through what they were going through, it didn't mean they didn't love her and she should just focus on being the best that she could be and not worrying about blaming herself or trying to live up to anybody's expectations (basically, what I tell my daughter). 

And I told her it was okay to cry it out, and I told her where the bathroom was and told her to take as long as she needed. Then I went back to watching my game. After she was done, came out, thanked me for listening her and saying that my words had made her feel much better, and then she went back out to the pool.

Done, right? Wrong. It escalated. Not as far as any more crying, but this girl is acting like I'm her father. She shows me her report cards, she tells me how her day is going, she bought me a Happy Father's Day coffee mug. I didn't know my wish list on Amazon was public until she bought me items from them on my birthday and on Christmas. She introduced me to one of her boyfriends, and I told my daughter later that I didn't really like the boy, and my daughter went and told the girl the next day, and she immediately broke up with him.

I'm not the only one who notices this behavior and the girl is not even hiding it. My daughter thinks it's funny and keeps joking about me adopting her so they can be sisters. My wife thinks it's cute and says that I can be a positive influence.

I know it's all pretty harmless (right?) but I'm just uncomfortable with it. I don't know what's going on in her home life, obviously she's not close to her biological dad and my daughter says she never even talks about him. But I just don't feel - is qualified the right word? - enough to fill that role. I was wondering if it would be okay to tell her to find somebody else?

A/N: Her name is Leila and she's 17 now, so I think that's a pretty mature age and she'll be able to handle it, right?",2020-10-09 09:54:20,84,947,0.97,4,31,10,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My sister is pissed/sad (I don‚Äôt event know anymore) with me for ‚Äúabandoning‚Äù her and mom.

Dad decided to stay here, but mom got a job somewhere else and decided to move.

I chose dad because he‚Äôs an effing amazing dad and also because of my current doctors. 

I have a genetic blood disorder. I‚Äôve been getting regular blood transfusions since I was less than a year old. Currently I need them once every 3 weeks or so, most likely for the rest of my life. Also chelation therapy. Not. Fun. 

This disorder is not common at all in my country, and my parents moved constantly when I was a kid trying to find good doctors. The amount of bullshit, and frankly scary experiences I‚Äôve had with other doctors and hospitals before my parents settled on this one is enormous. 

If I went with my mom, I‚Äôd have to move schools and find new doctors which I really don‚Äôt want to do.

We're remodeling some parts of the house by hand and are  having a hard time finding the right furniture, so the whole house is a little sparse. Non essential things are still stored in boxes, etc. 

My partner has ADHD and has always been on the messy side, whereas I am neater than the average person and hate a messy house. Being in an unfinished space has exacerbated his issues with tidying up, and I frequently find things laying around out of place. I do the bulk of the cleaning because mess bothers me more, and when I'm deep cleaning I tend to put miscellaneous clutter away in places I think are appropriate. Sometimes my idea of appropriate doesn't match my partner's.

This dynamic has started to become a reoccurring spat, where I clean up a big pile of clutter, inevitably misplace something, and my partner gets frustrated because he sees that as me losing his things. I've tried to compromise; I placed little dishes to collect loose change and small items, I built in floating shelves with key hooks, and I implemented a basket system to put things that I can't find a place for, so that he can review and put them away on his own. The problem is that the clutter piles still accumulate in places like the middle of the dining room table and on the floor. 

I'm tired of having this conversation so I told my partner that if he wants to keep his stuff from getting ""lost"", he just has to put it away properly before I get to it. I'm at a loss on how else to resolve the issue besides just not cleaning, which would make me miserable. He thinks I'm being the AH because I can't leave things untouched.

He was so excited for it as its his first managers position, but from the start there have been issues. He's in a managers position but the staff don't listen to him, and the other managers treat him like he's a lower position than them. He's being picked on, verbally abused and he comes home upset almost every day. They also haven't been paying him properly; he was promised ¬£9.30 p/h but he has only been receiving ¬£8.20 p/h (minimum wage). He's getting paid less hours than what he works, and he's being emergency taxed even though he's given them his P45. Luckily he has other income, otherwise he would not be able to afford rent.
He brought up the pay issues with the store manager, and was told he was not allowed to contact her outside of her work hours. He then spoke to her on shift and she said his pay had been sorted... it hadn't. She also said it was his fault he was being emergency taxed. He never received a copy of his contract, he has since asked for it twice with no response. His manager claims that it doesn't say how much p/h he's meant to earn in the contract, but he knows it does.
I've told him over and over to leave the job, I believe from the managers responses to his problems, these issues won't be solved and he will continue to work a stressful job at minimum wage. He can afford to pay rent without this job, and I'm worried about his mental health. He doesn't want to quit because he has a history of not being able to hold down a job, but I genuinely believe that this is not his fault. I have suggested a trade union to him but he hasn't seemed interested.
I feel kind of bad about pressuring him to quit, so I want some advice and I was wondering AITA for telling my boyfriend to quit his job?

UPDATE: Oscar has just called me, he has spoken to someone at the same position as him, Charlotte, who has looked on the computer and has found no files on Oscar except for the LAST page of his contract with nothing but his signature on it. He also believes that the printed name on there is not his handwriting. So the company has no record of his contract, P45 or even his ID, whereas others who started around the same time as him have their records on the computer. 
He has also discovered that he hasn't been paid for 2 weeks online training that he did, even though Ella (store manager) said he would be. Charlotte has also told him that training is meant to be paid at ¬£8.60 p/h which was NOT stated in his contract, he hasn't been paid for his training anyway and he has been receiving only ¬£8.20 p/h which is less than the associates are getting.",2020-11-14 13:50:50,29,65,0.89,0,1,5,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, in my family, we always have arm-wrestling competitions, generally the women arm-wrestle much more, for whatever reason. My aunt was a family legend, easily dominating everybody ( my mum was beaten by her so much) So, we had a family gathering a while ago, and of course, the arm-wrestling began. 

Now, about my wife, she is insanely competitive and fit, and a high school athlete, in both volleyball and boxing. She is someone who hates losing, and hates having losing in front of or to her loved ones, so in hindsight, I probably should have seen this coming. 

About my SIL, she is just as fit as my wife, and also quite competitive, and a high school boxer as well. 

So, my wife and SIL went around arm-wrestling everybody, and beating all the women they faced. Now, a key match was my wife going up against my cousin. My wife did beat my cousin, but it took some effort out of her, while my SIL beat her much faster and with less effort. 

So when the time came for the inevitable match between my wife and SIL, everybody joked around saying they'd find out who the ""Alpha Female"" is, placing small bets on who would win. Once again, this isn't a serious amount, just a couple pounds. I placed a bet on my SIL beating my wife, and everybody laughed, while my wife silently glared at me. I could tell that she was annoyed by this, but didn't think much of it, she'd either win, and be happy, or lose and we'd make some money off of it. 

The match happened, and it was kinda close, but kinda not, and in the end, my wife lost. Everybody cheered my SIL, who bowed and told my wife ""guess we know who's the Alpha Female"". My brother looked really smug about it, and jokingly told me ""my wife's stronger than your wife""

My wife looked really disheartened, but figured she'd get over it in a couple minutes, but after a while, she asked if we could leave. We left and on our way home, she started tearing up a bit, talking about how humiliated she was, and how even I thought she couldn't beat SIL.

We're both only 22, but our moms went to school together and introduced us as babies. We've been best friends ever since. I absolutely love her, she's more of a sister than my best friend. 

About 8 months ago now, she told me she was pregnant. I was over the moon for her. Her and her boyfriend have been wanting children for years, but the announcement came at a bad time. About a week beforehand, I suffered a third trimester miscarriage, and despite being only 22, this is the fourth child I have lost. I became pregnant at 18 and had a stillbirth. About a year later, I got pregnant again and gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. Due to infant sleep apnea, my daughter passed away in her sleep when she was four months old. My husband and I made all the efforts we could to revive her but it was too late by the time we had found her. Six months later, I found out I was pregnant again, but suffered a miscarriage at 11 weeks, and then soon after got pregnant again. At 30 weeks, we discovered our baby had no heartbeat and I had a stillbirth. 

My best friend has been my absolute rock over the past few years and I truly would not have got through the last few years without her support. I'm ecstatic that she's pregnant, I really am, but I physically will not be able to handle the baby shower, nor will I be able to spend time with my best friend and her baby without feeling some kind of resentment towards her, which I would obviously rather avoid and just leave our friendship civil where it is.

My best friend seemed understanding when I opened up with her, but ever since she has gone out of her way to make me feel horrendous about the situation. Whether it be very blatant indirects on social media, texts trying to guilt me from her, her husband and our mutual friends, everything. 

I received a text a few days ago from a mutual friend of ours. The conversation started off nice until she started telling me how selfish I was for not putting my own feelings aside to be there for my best friend. I told her that they weren't feelings I could put aside and that my best friend understood that. She then sent me screenshots from a group chat with my best friend calling me just about every name under the sun and giving girls I didn't even know very intimate details of each loss I have suffered. 

I reached out to my best friend and it led to an intense argument, with her saying she wouldn't want someone as miserable as me being around her child anyway. I called her, genuinely thinking it was some kind of prank, but it wasn't and she told me that she felt extremely betrayed at the fact I couldn't just ""get over it for one day"" to attend the baby shower.

She has a son who is around my fathers age and at this point I talk to him more than my own father. I have always been very kind to Stacey, talking with her, reaching out and just basically treating her like a 3rd grandmother. Recently, Stacey has started to hand me money as a gift for being kind to her all these years. In her words ""Her own grandchildren dont call her and im the only one from the kids in my family that calls her"". Apparently, she normally would give her granddaughters the same gift but they don't come around anymore. At first I was very appreciative of the money and made it clear to her that I do not expect it. It has now continued to happen and she doesn't want me to let anyone know about it for jealousy and other reasons. It has started to make me uncomfortable as I have a hard enough time accepting birthday and christmas gifts let alone a gift for just being nice to someone. I would like to ask her to stop giving these gifts to me as they kind of make me uncomfortable and I don't feel like its right to take her money. she has made it clear that she is doing it because she is appreciative, it just makes me a little uncomfortable.

I was diagnosed with depression a year ago, and since then my life has been full of ups and downs. My husband tried to support me even though he didn't understand the right to mental disorders. He works and supports them both while I only study (I'm in college).

&#x200B;

Recently I've been feeling worse and worse and I'm not in the mood to do much. My husband and I shared some tasks, but now I haven't cooked and I can barely muster the willpower to clean something. Even the simplest task wears me out very quickly and at the end of the day I always feel very tired, both physically and mentally. Despite this, I try my best to keep the house in order (my sister has come to my house to help).

Last night he came home from work and I hadn‚Äôt cooked dinner again or washed the dishes (I was busy with college stuff and my online consultation with my psychologist) and he was very upset about it. He complained that he was tired of asking for delivery and that it was a waste of money, since I could cook very well. I argued that I was busy and that I hadn't been feeling well all day.

I was very upset and went to spend the night at my sister's house (she lives relatively close to me). He tried to call me, but I didn't feel like arguing at the time. Now I'm feeling really bad. I know it works and I don't and that I could do more. I don't know how to fix this. My sister says that he was a complete asshole and that he should apologize on his knees.

So this isn‚Äôt really a big deal, but I‚Äôm curious as to the verdict.  My husband won‚Äôt let me play his video games at all now. I don‚Äôt want to do boss fights or anything, or any fights if I can help it. Usually I happily watch him play, but sometimes I want to do things myself. 

I mostly want to wander around, wade at the beach, look at sunsets, and pick flowers. He used to let me play, but I messed up a couple times. Once, he let me play with his dune buggy, and I drove it into the ocean by mistake. (Online, obviously, in GTA. )  As God is my witness, I thought dune buggies could go into water! Unfortunately I destroyed it. Then one time he let me drive a little remote controlled car when the mission was to blow other random cars up. Unfortunately, I accidentally blew up our own van, killing his character. It was an honest mistake. I had no idea what vehicle we were in. Each time he tried to yell ‚Äúno!‚Äù but too late. 

So now he won‚Äôt let me play. While I realize I screwed up a couple times, I have also helped him frequently. One time he had to play some music on a piano to solve a riddle, but he had no idea how to read music OR play a piano. He was super frustrated, but I had several years of piano lessons. So I pointed out which keys to play to solve the puzzle, while he controlled the game to play the piano. I have helped him solve other riddles directly back when he let me play occasionally but now he just asks for advice and for me to occasionally google things but won‚Äôt let me play. 

It‚Äôs not a big deal but which one is the AH? ;) Should he let me play for fun, once in a while, even if it may occasionally result in character death and/or online properly damage? (Especially since I often help solve riddles.) Or should I stop asking cause I know I have lousy hand eye coordination and have goofed up occasionally?

(If it matters all our money is pooled, but the game consoles were most likely gifts to him half from me, half from my parents. And he isn‚Äôt addicted to gaming AFAIK.)

Thanks!

ETA: I don‚Äôt really want to play the entire game myself from start to finish. I am really not good at video games! I just want to well, sight-see and have a bit of fun. I am good at solving riddles or puzzles but not good at combat or anything involving skill or reflexes. Also if I tried to play the whole game I would be taking away my husband‚Äôs video game time/tv. It‚Äôs in our living room, but is the biggest tv and all the game systems are hooked up there.",2020-11-26 21:12:22,27,10,0.91,0,5,2,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have an amazing 3 year old girl together. I don‚Äôt want to get too much into it but I‚Äôm not long for this earth if you catch my drift. I have about 8 months before I shed this earthly form. Don‚Äôt fucking start with the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry‚Äù stuff, that‚Äôs cool in all but I don‚Äôt like being treated or looked at like I‚Äôm going to die. In fact I don‚Äôt even really like talking about it.

We‚Äôve already handled my affairs, my wife knows what I want, cremation and a new daddy for my daughter. My life insurance will take great care of them, and I‚Äôve come to peace with my death. My wife on the other hand is understandably a mess. I don‚Äôt blame her, but sometimes I think it‚Äôs annoying. We‚Äôve been spending as much time as possible together as a family which I really enjoy, but it‚Äôs incredibly difficult to enjoy my last months on this world when my wife becomes inconsolable. 

I do my best to comfort, her I really do, but it‚Äôs hard to assure someone that everything will be fine after your own death. Honestly it makes my time with her more depressing. I don‚Äôt want her to have to think about it as much, I want her last months with me to feel like the best months of her life. When I‚Äôm gone I want her to think about the great places we‚Äôre going, the amazing love we‚Äôre making, the fantastic foods I‚Äôm cooking for her, only the good things, she can‚Äôt do that if every time I get close to her she starts crying. 

Last week, we were cuddling in bed and I asked her to be big spoon. I turned around and she got on my back. I could hear her smelling my hair. She then started quietly crying. I asked her what was wrong, she said she was going to miss the way I smelled. I turn I sat up with her so she could cry on my shoulder.  After she stopped I brought up my displeasure. My exact words were, ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre hurting and I want you to feel better and take care of you as much as possible. But right now, I need to to shut up about my death. It‚Äôs not doing any of us any good to talk about or think about my death.‚Äù

She was shocked, she told me that she‚Äôs never seen me be such an uncaring asshole. I apologized profusely, and told her that I Just want to stop talking about it and thinking about it. I talked to my sister and she said I‚Äôm the biggest asshole she‚Äôs ever met.

I committed to a year with the roommate and then we would evaluate how things are going. After a year, I decided I want to live in the apartment by myself again.

When my roommate moved in, she moved into a fully furnished house and pretty much did not have to bring anything. We use my kitchen table, she sleeps on the bed I bought for the second bedroom, my coffee pot, my dishes (mostly), I had a couch that we used but then we moved it to the porch and went half and half on another couch. We use my TV, my roku, my entertainment center, my coffee table - you get the gist.

My complex requires anyone over the age of 18 who is living in the apartment to be on the lease. So when she came she signed up on the lease instead of it being my name with her as a roommate. Now my roommate is telling me she shouldn't have to be the one that has to move out since she's on the lease and it's not her choice to move. She thinks that I should have to be the one to move out. My perspective is I told her this would be on a year by year basis, I was here first, I allowed her into my home, and the house is 97% full of my things.

At the beginning I was supposed to stay in my parents second home (inherited from my great grandparents.) but my sisters family moved in there, and I got moved into my parents main home. It was fine until a month later my brother and his wife moved in because she was having a baby and needed the support. They were supposed to move back to their property but my dad convinced them that that land was a bad investment and to sell their portion out and move in until they can get a place in town.
Situation: My main plan had been to move back to the city I had been living in, but I can‚Äôt take it here anymore. My niece (8yeare old) is a brat, and my nephew (7 months old) is a typical baby. I finally decided that I‚Äôm just going to get a job here and get a cheap apartment until I can save enough to get back to where I want to be, I need to make sure I have minimum three months rent. The problem is my mom is asking why I‚Äôm making this choice when technically she‚Äôs right when she says it would be easier to save the money if I stayed here. It sounds really messed up but I can‚Äôt stand kids for long periods, they are so awful and loud not to mention 7 people in a three bedroom is sending my anxiety off the charts.

I hate lying to her but I‚Äôm afraid she‚Äôll be really upset that I don‚Äôt feel comfortable in her house. So would I be the asshole for telling my mom I want to move? Should I lie?

Background: my (M29) fianc√©e (F33) has been asking me to go with her to a coworker‚Äôs wedding for about a few weeks. I expressed anxiety about it because 1) I‚Äôm a huge introvert, have social anxiety, and wouldn‚Äôt know anyone else 2) There‚Äôs a pandemic (I live in the US - it ended up being over 100 people, less than 5 wore masks at any given time). She put some pressure on me, told me it would mean a lot to her, and she wanted me to meet her work friends. 

Was talking to a friend about making compromises for your relationship, so I decided to go and try to put on a brave face and have fun. And I really did have fun for  about the first 2 and a half hours. Still anxious but met some nice people, had a decent time. 

Then a guy starting yelling loudly near her friend (who was one of 3 Black people there) about his political views started following our group around seemingly wherever we went, yelling randomly about it then looking at him, seemingly to see if he would react. 

At that point my anxiety was bad because negative attention-seeking people like that stress me out, and he‚Äôd clearly been drinking. So we were chatting outside in a small group, feeling the anxiety getting worse. Tried to nudge her, saying we needed to head home to feed our dog (he usually eats at 6:30 and we wouldn‚Äôt get home until 10). She basically just ignored me and said he‚Äôd be fine (which is true and I should‚Äôve just been honest about how I was feeling). 

Then they call everyone in for the speeches, I‚Äôm walking behind my SO and as soon as I hit the doorway I kinda freak out. All of the lights and people and noise just hit me, so I turned around and just walked to the car. Didn‚Äôt have my phone to text her, so I just stood out there for 15-20 minutes. 

When she came out she was pissed. She cried and told me how upset, angry, and hurt she was for most of the hour and a half drive home until she just stopped talking. This was yesterday and all day she‚Äôs barely spoken to me. When she has, it‚Äôs been very short. Tried to explain my side but she said she feels like she has to concede to make me comfortable. 

For some context, we moved 800+ miles from our family and friends for our careers 2 years ago. It‚Äôs been difficult to find people we connect with. She said it hurt the most that she was ‚Äúfinally having a good time‚Äù and feeling comfortable here and I couldn‚Äôt stick it out for her.

I get how disappointing that must have felt, but it also feels like she has no empathy with me. AITA?",2020-10-11 23:12:35,107,417,0.93,7,20,30,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They do not know if it's cancerous or not. Before he left for the city this morning he handed me a wrapped gift that felt like a book. I was very confused but also touched, thinking it was some kind of sincere hand-written booklet or something sweet. I love my dad very much. I told him I love him, hugged him, and he an l and my brother went on their way (brother driving).

I asked my mom what it was he gave me and she responded that my father wanted to give me something ""in case he doesn't come back."" Obviously, this scared me. This is real. This is happening. All I could do was hope for the best. I was too tired and emotional and I hadn't slept so I decided not to open it.

Well, I opened it just a moment ago. As I feared, it's a Bible- and a nice one. The thing  is, I left Christianity about six years ago- and gladly so. He knows this. He knows I strongly disagree with the Bible as it goes against everything I stand for as a human being. I feel as though the teachings of this book have personally hurt me.

My issue is... Why did he give me a Bible knowing I'm against it? Was it to soothe himself? Does it make him feel reassured? Or did he give me a Bible to disrespect my religious beliefs/lack thereof? I honestly don't understand. I'm usually pretty good at reading people and understanding why they do certain things or act certain ways but I'm at a loss.

I'm thinking of just placing the book on his bed for when he returns but I don't want to hurt his feelings. I just feel constantly invalidated and disrespected by my family and I'm tired of it. Maybe I'm looking at this with too much bias?

Anyway, Reddit, WIBTA if I return the Bible my dad gave me before he went into surgery?


**UPDATE:** Thank you dearly for all of your comments and honest answers. You guys really made me think from multiple different perspectives and got me thinking. I've decided to keep the book for now and *maybe* talk about it once he's recovered.

SURGERY UPDATE: My father is out of surgery. It went really well and he's recovering in ICU. They managed to remove 95% of the tumor (more than they thought they could) throughout the 10+ hour surgery. I'm so happy he's doing well all things considered. It's like a heavy weight released in a heavy sigh.

**SECOND UPDATE:** My father is on a ventilator and needed a drain tube because there was a build-up of pressure in his brain. He wasn't responding. I was just told he's awake and answering questions with thumbs up or down. This is great news. Docs say he's out of the woods for now but they're watching him closely.

The baby came very prematurely and has medical problems related to that, which means she has to stay in the NICU. Unfortunately, new policies this year mean that parents are only allowed to visit their children in the NICU once a week each. If there is only one parent for a child, that parent can come twice a week.  

I tried to give my wife as much time as possible because she is the mom and was trying to pump, which they only accepted if it was done at the hospital, but after two weeks, pumping wasn't going to happen, and I really wanted to try to bond too. I had only seen the baby once, and not even a solid look. It's hard to bond with someone that you've never seen, and I want to be involved too. 

I've started taking my day a week, cutting my wife's time to one day a week also. She's devastated. We had a major argument where she said she felt that the baby was being taken from her even more. I tried to explain my side, but she didn't listen and spent the night with her parents, who are now calling me to say that they understand that it's not fair, but I ""need to understand that it's much harder on the mom than the dad"".

So hes hard of hearing (he wears a hearing aid to help him to hear) so he has a issue with waking up since he cant really hear his alarm. 

For the past year i have been travelling over every weekend (1hr+ commute) to wake him up before we go out together. My country is small so its pretty much one end to the other.

But sometimes ill just ask him to meet me outside instead as I dont have time to commute the 1 hour over. And since he has a hard time waking up, ill spam call him till he wakes up. Annnd he still can be late (30mins-1hr) because he loses track of time and takes his own sweet time to prepare.

Before this i was in a 3 year toxic rs which my ex always ditched me and made me wait, and i always spend hours waiting downstairs his house and calling him before he eventually wakes up.

My current bf treats me well, but its just his time issue that i cant stand. Everytime i tell him off he says okay im sorry ill try etc. But it happens again and again each time i ask to meet outside. Im also sick of babysitting him by waking up early just to prepare and go over to wake up him and wait for hik to prepare before we can head out.

So today we are supposed to meet at 1pm. I started calling him at 1045am to get him to wake up. He wakes up and then never replies me all the way. I assume that he fell back asleep (happened before) so i got pissed off and lost my patience with him on text. 

He replied me at 1140am saying that he was in the shower and blamed me for assuming that he fell back asleep. He knows that i need the assurance to know that the person im meeting wont MIA on me, especially him since he has difficulty waking up and the tendancy to fall back asleep. He claims i dont understand him or try to because of his hearing issue, he cant wake up properly. But ive been accommodating and trying to be understanding. But the constant fear and anxiety i get from him not waking up is taking a toll on me.

My mom and dad both had their stories about how if you lose a spouse you find ways of enriching your life until you can be reunited. The idea was you don't remarry because marriage to your one true love is sacred. And I grew up loving that and believing in it because who doesn't love the idea that the great love of your life is with you even if they pass and you will be together again once you make it through life.

Then my mom died and my dad remarried. I was 9 when my mom died and 11 when my dad remarried. It was a huge blow to me and shattered what I was raised to believe in. I spent a long time hating that my dad had remarried and threw away his chance to be with my mom again, and that he had changed our whole family. I didn't like her because of this and I was distant and in a lot of pain. Over time, a lot of time, it got better and when I was 16 I finally started to be happy for him and I supported what he did.

But to me, I still hold onto the ideal of what he and my mom taught me. This has come up again because my boyfriend and I have been telling our daughter (2) the stories that my parents told me. We even got both of them printed into books so when she's a little older she can read them too. My dad saw one of the books and didn't like that I was still clinging to those stories. He said he thought things had changed for both of us when my mom died. I told him it wasn't fair for him to expect me to stop believing in something he and my mom taught me to be true, or at least true to us, and that I still supported him and was happy for him, but I will always believe what I believe, or maybe something has to change for me.

My dad looks at it as me feeling like my stepmom isn't his true wife and she's not a true part of my family. The former is untrue. I learned to accept she is just as much his wife as my mom. I do still have some mixed feelings on the latter. But in general I have accepted he loves her and she is part of our lives. I have grown to like her. He also isn't happy that I worded it the way I did, like it was such a tough thing for me to be happy for him and support him in his marriage. He thinks I should apologize. For what exactly, I'm not so sure, I think maybe he feels I'm being not quite truthful or trying to use what he said to me in the past to hurt him. But its not true. It's just now we hold very different beliefs. And that's okay. He's still my dad and I still love and respect how he feels. I just want the same from him.

It was a necklace with her mother‚Äôs writing on it. I started out by giving her the necklace. She loved it and was sobbing. While she was focused on it I got down on a knee and got the ring out. When she noticed it I didn‚Äôt get the reaction that I expected. She was like ‚Äúwhat is this? What are you doing?‚Äù I tried to ask for her to marry me. She cut me off mid sentence and said ‚Äúno, no, no. Stop please.‚Äù I got quite and didn‚Äôt know what to do. She said ‚Äúare you really trying to propose to me on this day? Are you serious?‚Äù I told her I was 100% serious. She said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe this. You can‚Äôt use this day to do that. This is so disrespectful.‚Äù I tried to apologize and tell her that I did know it would hurt her. I tried to explain that I did it to try and make it a happy, special day. She told me to take her and drop her off at her dads. He came out smiling until he saw her face. He was confused too. She left the car and ran inside before either of us could say anything. I explained what happened to her dad and he didn‚Äôt understand it and said that he felt awful for me. 

I tried calling and texting her several times. She finally sent me a text late that night that said ‚ÄúI need time.‚Äù I haven‚Äôt heard from her since. Was I an asshole for proposing on that day?",2020-09-17 20:42:22,252,1047,0.96,84,34,8,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Boss: ""Why are you cooking so late? Never mind I need your help"" (Fucking 8:45 pm because I am a grave shift employee so yeah I was cooking late...)

Me:""Yeah... What can I do for you?""

Boss: ""So I'm working really hard to get you your 40 hours but they (being the security company I work for) don't want to do that but I'm working really hard, also I'm working hard to get your vacation settled. So my wife has Chemo tomorrow and I need you to work 6 am until I can find someone to cover you ( LITERALLY any other time he's said it like that I always end up working 12+ hours) You'll be getting lots of over time and you need it yes?

Me: ""Yeah no one else is going to tell me your personal business..."" \*totally feeling the only reason he told me just now even though everyone else knows this is to use it to guilt trip me into doing this for him\* Look boss I gotta call you back I'm in the middle of cooking and trying to concentrate on this and not burning my self so I need to get back to you.""

\*we hang up\* NOT 5 min later I get a text

Boss: ""Did you decide to help me?"" 2 min goes by Boss: ""I really need you to help me on this."" 5 min goes by

Longtime lurker, firsttime poster here. So this actually happened several years back, but it always comes back up amongst the family around Christmas time.
So because of my turbulent upbringing, I (20F) lived with my grandmother for a few years while in high school. I was born with an eye condition that eventually left me totally blind. My grandmother was never around much when I was growing up, so she doesn't really understand how independent I actually am and also doesn't respect some of my boundaries as a disabled person. For example, she gets upset when I tell her to let me do things independently, asks really intrusive questions like ""How do you clean up after yourself when using the bathroom?"" (I wish I was kidding), and just generally treats me like I know less about being blind than she does.
So a few Christmases back, I asked my grandmother for new clothes for Christmas so I could have a new wardrobe for college. She seemed pretty excited about this, and so was I. A few weeks before Christmas, she came into my room and asked me to try on some clothes so she could see if they fit me. I said sure, and asked her what they looked like‚Äîwhat color they were, what patterns, etc. She flat-out refused because they were Christmas presents and that would ruin the surprise. I was disgusted and immediately refused to try on the clothes, because, in my estimation, she was discriminating against me based on my blindness. If I had been able to see, she would not have been able to have me try on the clothes and still keep the gifts a surprise, so I felt kind of taken advantage of. My grandmother got huffy and said I was being unreasonable, and when I asked other family members later, they were split on whether I was the AH or not in this situation. So, years later, after many sideways comments and blow-up fights with G-ma about how I'm an entitled and stubborn disabled person, I'm taking my woes to Reddit.

Flash forward: My husband‚Äôs birthday weekend is coming up so I ask him what he wants to do. Not sure if he‚Äôll be able to take off, so we don‚Äôt plan on going anywhere.

Later, he tells me all of his plans, which include playing a one-shot D&D campaign, smoking meats, making bread, and having his friends over. So, I took a hint. Sounds to me like he wants a special weekend to himself. Got it. 

So I make plans to go out with my friends for a few hours on the day he‚Äôs smoking meats and BBQing. I say, ‚Äúit should only be a few hours, but if they want to stay and have a few drinks I‚Äôm not going to rush them.‚Äù Now, he‚Äôs mad.

He ‚Äúwanted to spend time with me.‚Äù (Even though I don‚Äôt play D&D, I‚Äôm not eating meat right now, and recently he told me to leave the house more.)

So now I'm wondering if I was the ass. I don't really care if she gets pregent at 21 because I will still love and support her either way. I just think you shouldn't get pregent before you finish collage. But that is still my opinion. (BTW we are 15). So Reddit AITA?

We have a downstairs neighbour who's a middle-aged single guy who lives alone and we generally have a good relationship with him. He owns the unit. Local noise regulations essentially say you can't make a lot of noise between 11pm-7am, but reasonable noise is expected to be tolerated outside of those hours. 

We work out at home between 7am-8am on weekdays before we head to work. We've never been gym-goers, but Covid has left us with no choice either way. Our workouts are entirely strength-based training (i.e. there's no aerobics/jumping around) and we have those cushion puzzle mats set up in the room we use to exercise. I have absolutely no doubt that it makes some noise whether it's the floor creaking or some weights clanging around a bit. However, we're very gentle with putting weights back down on the floor. We also don't play any music because we use headphones. 

After I finished my workout this morning, we got a knock on the door. Guy downstairs said it was /really/ noisy and a disturbance. We apologized and he went on his way - it was a polite exchange. 

However, I'm now at a crossroads. I hate having to work out in the evenings because my job (law) is often unpredictable and some days I end up in the office fairly late. The last thing I want to do after being in the office for 12 hours is start lifting weights. Getting it done in the morning allows me to stay on track. On the other hand, I do like the guy. He's been a good neighbour and I chat with him fairly regularly when we're both out on our balconies. He doesn't work much (part-time freelancer) and he's typically up really late, so I assume he's often sleeping late as well which is why it's an issue for him.

He kind of took care of me when we were growing up because neither of our dads was around and my mom was working all the time, and besides that wasn't super interested in her kids beyond the basics. My mom got remarried when I was a senior in high school so I never really got to know my stepdad or two stepsisters, and at college I'd choose to stay at my dorm during breaks because I didn't want to intrude on their ""happy family"" or whatever.

Now my school's closed down and gone online due to COVID, so I'm back at home. My mom keeps pushing me to bond with my stepsisters; they seem like okay kids but they're a lot younger so we don't really have a lot in common. My mom and I have minor clashes constantly, she thinks my bro influenced me too much/turned me against her, she thinks I'm in my room on my laptop too much, I make jewelry as a hobby/side business and she thinks I'm being rude not teaching my stepsisters or letting them use the beads as they keep asking. On the flip side I'm kind of resentful that she didn't give overly large of a fuck about me all the years I was growing up and now she's got these shiny new white kids and a husband and suddenly she's mom of the year, and that sometimes results in me being unnecessarily petty with her. All that to say, sometimes things become pretty toxic. My brother lives in a city close by, so when it gets too much I take the train over there and spend the night. We watch a couple movies, play cards or chess, drink with his neighbors sometimes. I sleep on his couch and commute back when my mom realizes I'm gone.

My brother recently started dating someone from his work (25F), and she's been over his apartment a bunch. Of course I try to give them their privacy, stay in the living room doing my own thing, but I also understand wanting the apartment to themselves, and when I was looking through my brother's texts she said something about his kid sister always being around. My brother defended me but I feel like it's also not great to him, like who wants to have sex when the sibling whose diapers you changed is in the next room. My mom is also mad that I keep going over there, and she said I can't just keep running away when things get rough, and that my stepdad is helping with my tuition so I owe it to him to make an effort. But I do chores and everything, I just want to live my life and let them live theirs.

And she gave birth to our daughter two months ago. She carried our child because of medical history in my family. 

She had a bad delivery. Very long and painful and she does not handle pain well. She did not want to have an epidural because she wanted to be completely present during the birth and I totally understand and support her in her decisions. 

Towards the end of her delivery she started to get quite hysterical from the pain, and yes this was very understandable but she started to get so hysterical with her breathing, movement etc. that is was becoming dangerous for her and the baby. 

Myself, the doctors and nurses all tried to get her to be as calm as possible and eventually the doctor needed to get firm with her and myself and a nurses needed to hold her down a little bit because to baby was in distress and my wife was not doing well either. This way our daughter was eventually born and she was so good. My wife got pain medication (which she wanted and planned for) and she was doing much better as well. 

Now 2 months later we finally get to see some people and introduce our daughter.

She even had a discussion with a friend on how you can never trust doctors in general and how they never respect patients.

Around this time last year, my manager (we‚Äôll call her MGR1) told me to apply for a senior role on a new client I had been introduced to (most larger clients have a senior role). I went through the interview process and everything, only to be told the position was opened to retain someone else. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. 

MGR1 ended up leaving the company at the beginning of this year, and my current manager (we‚Äôll call her MGR2) has been leading the team ever since. Soon after she became my manager, the senior on the account I primarily work on quit without notice. At the same time, another person on our team was out on maternity leave (we‚Äôll call her Sarah.) I took on a bunch of extra work (and keep in mind, MGR2 is totally new to this client, so support was very limited) on top of all of my normal duties in order to keep the team afloat.

And then one day, I get a call from MGR1 saying she wants to offer me a position at her new company working under her. I decided to go ahead and interview, and used her offer as leverage with MGR2 for a raise. I got the raise (it really wasn‚Äôt much) and declined MGR1‚Äôs offer. I was told by MGR2 that all the work I did through all the transition was appreciated and that I was getting the pay to get the ‚Äúsenior‚Äù title at a later date. I stayed with the company because I saw a path of growth for myself, given that they were retaining me, and I was being placed in a leadership development program. 

Well, a few weeks ago, a team lead (higher than a senior role) position opened up on our team. I did NOT apply for it because I knew exactly who the position was opened up for (we‚Äôll call her Maggie.) I knew that Sarah (the one out on maternity leave earlier this year) also applied, and she knew that she would also not be getting the job, as it was intended for Maggie. Today, Sarah tells me that our suspicions were indeed true and the position was opened up for Maggie. BUT Sarah also mentioned that MGR2 offered her Maggie‚Äôs senior role, and that the position would be opened up internally for Sarah‚Äôs application to be moved into it, but she would not announce the opening to the team, and to keep the whole thing under wraps. 

My manager knows I‚Äôve wanted the senior role and knows that I stayed with the company because I saw myself in a position to grow. It really seems like she wants Sarah‚Äôs opening to be kept under wraps because she knows it would really hurt me.

Maybe it wouldn't bother me so much if I didn't know that she told him everything, but afterwards she will come back to me saying something like ""so husband and I were talking about you and what you told me and this is what he thinks.""

Don't get me wrong, I do trust her husband and I absolutely adore him, but I don't always want him to know everything I'm dealing with. And this hasn't just happened with her telling him about my issues. Currently there is a lot of tension in our friend group because I was venting about a different friend (X) and how X reacted to an unrelated situation and he was frustrated with a few of us in the friend group. I 100% agree that I was the asshole because someone could see this as gossiping about our group, but I was genuinely just venting about the situation and she goes and tells her husband and now friend X is mad at me because he doesn't understand why I told her in the first place. 

So WIBTA if I asked her not to tell her husband everything we talk about? I honestly don't know if this is normal because we're all so young and I don't want to cause issues in their marriage if this is, but sometimes I wish I could just tell my bestfriend something without her husband hearing about it too.",2020-11-24 18:43:53,25,8,0.85,0,3,9,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

    Around March of that year when the pandemic started here in Brazil, Ted (my dog) started to have epileptic seizures for no apparent reason, we did every kind of test possible and nothing was discovered, we started giving medication and so we went, until October, when the seizures came back stronger than ever, we took it to the vet who prescribed that we increase the dose. After this last crisis he was never the same, he was paralyzed for about 5 days, we had to feed him with porridge for spoon, besides when he moved again he did not attend anymore by his own name and had become aggressive not letting us touch or approach.
    The worst of all was this Saturday when we noticed that his mouth was bleeding, but because of the aggressiveness we couldn't approach to check what was wrong, so we sent a message to the vet who took care of him and I think for fear, she didn't want to attend him. We took care of him the way we could until Monday and by some miracle he let us take him to another vet, when we got there, he was sedated for being aggressive, after checking, Vet said that he had a very bad wormhole inside his mouth and they would have to operate to take out everything that had already been eaten, obviously we allowed the operation and unfortunately all the sky of the mouth had to be taken out, leaving exposed the communication between the nose and the mouth.
    In addition, a mass was found inside the mouth that could be a possible cancer. He will have to take 10 medicines and pass 3 ointments every day until his death, he does not let us pass the ointments and for the time being he only accepts to take the medicines rolled up in the ham and according to the vet he is feeling a lot of pain and I can't stand to see him like this, the hospital where he was treated said that they doesn't euthanize, so I'm looking for other places that do.
    The vet was really kind with us and I don't believe there's any other person to be called the asshole. I'm afraid I'm being an asshole by taking my dog's life, hope u guys can help me with this.",2020-11-27 12:11:10,19,11,0.92,0,5,7,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About a week ago she told me that he was going to come stay with us for a couple of days but i was totally against it , cause i get really anxious around other people especially strangers . We went a bit back and forth but at the end i backed out cause i don't really have a say as to who stays at our house and i don't really want to hurt her feelings.

I met him , turns out that he's a really good guy so i thought maybe its going to be ok , but as the days past i just mostly stayed hidden away in my room trying to stay alone as much as possible cause i got really anxious while interacting with him , and the anxiety got worse when my mom was at work cause i basically had to interact with him , so i asked my mom when he's gonna leave , she told me that they don't really know cause they are waiting for the order for him to go to Germany ( he's a trucker ) . I hold out for one more night and at the third day where shes gone for most of the day , my anxiety skyrockets so i ask her again and again if they have any news as to when he's going to leave , she replies that they don't , i'm still trying to be understanding but i start to crack a little and i ask her to basically kick him out , the answer was no of course , which i understand.

Preferably by the sea.

I'm getting married next year and I've told my partner that I would like to live in a different part of the country for a month before we get married. I said I would visit him every week and we could text/ call frequently. He wasn't very happy about the decision.

I know it might be seen as a little selfish, but it would give me that alone time that I need before starting a new life. Just to be clear, I am very much in love and I don't have cold feet. As an introvert who hasn't had any proper alone time in **eight years**, I feel like I just need this.

You cant just drive your truck into business plazas and park. You have to go through middlemen to get scheduled. These were slow usually. $200 a day most days. At the storage unit we kept our truck at, a truck owner told us about a food court made up of different food trucks. A lot of businesses around it, so the employees+ customers would come to the food court.

We would cook our food before opening, and hold them in built in heat holding pans. We had 3 long rectangular ones. Our noodle dish, pancit, took up 1 and 1/2 pans. Fried rice took a half pan. Chicken and pork BBQ 1/2 pans each. That was it. 2 other trucks that would often be on the same days as us, had a lot more variety. One was a hibachi grill, noodle/rice + 3 or 4 different protein choices, with different styles. The other was fairly similar with his menu. The first few weeks, a lot of people took interest in the new kid on the block. But after a few weeks, sales went from $600 a day to $300 a day, if we were lucky.

So, I tried to suggest that we should switch to a simpler noodle dish like lo mein. Keep fried rice. Put fried rice and lo mein in a half pan each, giving us space for 4 half pans. We could change up the different meat preparations every few weeks. She didnt understand what I was trying to tell her. So I took her to Panda Express to show her what Im talking about. She didnt see the similarity. Then, she started saying she wants to change pancit to pad thai. Our customers only option would be pad thai. Despite me telling her not everyone likes that, she insisted it will catch on, and people will just grow to like it. I already struggled convincing her to get us a ticket rack to keep orders organized. She wont take advice from anyone, even more successful truck owners. Even when people tried to tell her how to properly back her truck into her storage space, she wouldnt listen. She'd hold up everyone for near 20 minutes, while it only took everyone else 5 minutes at most. So after all this, I mentally gave up on the truck. I'd show up for shifts still and do my job. But once she started saying she feels like the truck wont be successful, I agreed. Told her she should sell it and give up. She got angry with me.

People who knew about it asked me, I'd explain my POV. Some would tell me I shouldve tried harder. Made it seem like I did nothing to help.

Now, let's get to it. 

My girlfriend (23F) has a condition usually called ""Giggle incontinence"". The short explanation is that she loses control of her bladder when she laughes, sneezes, coughs etc. As far as I know she's always had this problem and I never had any issue with it. The problem is that it got worse over the last couple of months. Before, she usually ""lost"" a couple of drops when she sneezed and actually peed herself only once or twice since I've known her when she had an extreme laughing fit. However, for the last couple of months she peed herself quite often when she sneezed or coughed. She already went to three different urologists, but all of them told her more or less that there is nothing she can do about it except training her pelvic floor muscles and hoping that it helps to lessen the amount of urine she loses. So for now it seems that the problem stays. Due to the increasing number of times she peed herself after sneezing I asked her to wear diapers in some situations. For example, she already peed twice on the passenger seat of our car and it was a nightmare to clean and dry both times. She also peed on the seat in the cinema when she had to cough at the end of a movie. When she had a cold last week, she wet our bed three times within five days. The morning after the third time I sat down to talk to her. I asked her if she would wear diapers in some situations like during longer car rides and similar situations. I also asked her to wear diapers to bed while she's still ill because it's not the best experience to wake up because your girlfriend just wet the bed. However, when I talked to her she started screaming at me and told me how much of an asshole I am for treating her like a baby and things like this. I tried to explain to her that it would be a lot better for both of us and that it would save both of us a lot of work and her a lot of embarrassment. She didn't respond to that at all and just took her bag, told me she had to get to work on time and left the house. 

So, now the important question: Am I the asshole for telling my girlfriend to wear diapers in some situations?

**Edit:** I should have clarified, but I was in a hurry typing this, so: My girlfriend already wears incontinence pads due to her condition but they don't always ""hold up"" so she leaks when she loses alot of urine. Also I'm no native speaker. I didn't use the word ""diaper"" when I talked to her, I used the word ""Inkontinenzhosen"", but I didn't find the english counterpart for this word so I used the word ""diaper"" for this post.",2020-08-18 10:44:20,583,3288,0.97,1,82,88,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I (28f) will be getting married in September. I have a blind friend who mostly relies on her guide dog. The dog obviously has access rights to all places.

Now I am in a sticky situation and I can sense that I will be TA. I have three chronic illnesses that I take 23 pill a day for, severe asthma and you guessed it, an extremely severe dog allergy. Usually when I meet with my friend we meet in the open and I take two allergy pills. However, because of all the other medication I take these pills make me extremely drowsy to the point where I am officially not allowed to drive and I usually crash as soon as I get home from our get togethers.

Our wedding will be very intimate, i.e. we will be in relatively small rooms. I feel horrible about this but I don‚Äôt think I can let my friend bring her dog. It just wouldn‚Äôt work. I talked about it with my fiance and some friends. Finally, I talked to my friend about it, explained the situation and said I would love her to come but she can‚Äôt bring her dog. I said that four of our mutual friends had offered to ‚Äúbe on a roster‚Äù and assist her should she need it. Alternatively, if she is not comfortable with this she could bring a person of her choosing to the wedding or I‚Äôd pay for a professional aid for the day. I think it is important to note that her dog is not for any additional issues like seizures or anything like that.

Unfortunately, she was less than happy with my suggestions. She accused me of being ableist and thinking her disability can be switched off for the day.

I understand what I asked was a lot and it is a difficult topic. I told her to tell me if she changes her mind and I‚Äôd be happy to make arrangements. But I won‚Äôt budge.

A little bit of background: I developed an eating disorder at the beginning of 2020. I lost about 20% of my body weight and I was restricting and over exercising. Obviously this had a lot of terrible effects on my health. I lost my period and I had other effects from the low hormone levels. It honestly got pretty bad, and no one could tell because it was during quarantine and I couldn't see anyone.

About a month ago I decided I was tired of it. I was tired of constantly freezing, of feeling like passing out when I got up, of not being able to sleep because my hips dug into my bed, of not even being able to look in the mirror without wanting to cry. Well I decided to get help and I'm now seeing a therapist and a dietician.

Together, we decided that I should try an ""all-in"" or intuitive eating approach, in which I basically eat whatever I want whenever I want to. A couple of days after I started eating again, I noticed that I was always incredibly hungry. I mentioned it to my dietician and apparently it's extreme hunger, which happens to a lot of people recovering from EDs, and it's because the body needs a ton of food to recover all the damage that's been done to it. She also told me to always, always indulge it, so since then I've been eating way more than a normal person would. And honestly I've been doing a lot better. I've put on some more weight, I feel better about food, and I don't feel like passing out everytime I get up.

Yesterday I went out to dinner with four friends for the first time in forever. This was a huge step for me because I've always felt insecure about eating around other people. 

It was a sort of place where you order each course separately. When we got there they all got drinks, but I didn't because I'm trying to cut down on alcohol. Then they said they were going to split two appetizers, and asked me if I wanted to split with them. I was starving so I said no and got my own. Then they all got an entree, so I did too. I also got two sides because they looked good. At the end, my friends said they were going to split a large dessert. I decided I would get three of the mini ones, because I wanted to try some new things out.

I didn't notice anything off during the meal and we parted and said we would do it again sometime. This morning, I texted the group chat and said I really enjoyed the meal and hoped we could do it again soon. I didn't get an answer but didn't think much of it.

This afternoon though I got a text from the friend I'm closest to. She told me that she felt bad and wanted to be honest, and that they all didn't really want me to eat with them again. She said that they felt uncomfortable with how much I was eating, and that two of them were on diets and that being around me made it hard for them. She said that they all thought it was better if we didn't do it again. Now I feel awful about how I acted. I'm going to talk to my therapist when I can, but I wanted some other opinions first.

&#x200B;

So, I (25F) met someone (22F) online a while ago, and we've been together for a few months. She lives up in Ohio and I live down in Texas. We've talked about closing the gap here and there and we are thinking about moving in together sometime next year a few months after our 1 year anniversary. 

&#x200B;

Thing is, my mom (I know better than to post mommas age on the internet, F) has colon cancer. From what I hear, it's the less ""fatal"" kind of cancer, but I do know someone who's aunt died of it after they discovered her at stage 4. My mom caught it for the first time as it was reaching stage 2, and since a surgery and (A lot of) chemotherapy, they've kept it in remission/under control, and from what the doctors are saying, the cancer won't kill her but she's probably going to be going to chemo from here on. You can bet chemo takes it out of her. Every other week she goes in for chemo, and that week on chemo day and pump-removal day she is plum out of energy. In general, any day after chemo day she's in general low on energy.   


What doesn't help any of this is due to other medical problems, my stepdad/her husband is bedridden. So, any tasks he would do someone else has to do. Some things I am able to help with, but some of these things ma hires a professional. However, now my ma has to take care of him (Pooping, bathing, etc) and that certainly takes even more energy out of her. She doesn't have to do all of the changing and bathing for him, as there is a professional who is much stronger than any of us that help with that during the day, but they ain't there all the time. So if a blowout happens at 3AM then... well...

&#x200B;

She doesn't *rely* on me, but I do what I can to help her. Getting last minute groceries that were forgotten, some gardening/landscaping, running by the house to feed the dogs if she's going to be out late for one reason or another, restoring an old laptop, etc. Since I'm in the area, I'm more than happy to help her in any way that I can. All she has to do is give me a ring. She raised me, she beat addiction and worked to rebuild our relationship, she helped me with education, and I kinda feel like an ass for thinking about leaving the area, especially since I moved back into the area from some other part of Texas just this last summer.

My wife is seeing a physician for her post partum and has been seeing a therapist. She‚Äôs on her mat leave currently. I had two weeks off when the baby arrived and I‚Äôm currently working from home. So, I‚Äôm trying to help out as much as possible and trying to make things easier for her but at the same time, I am trying to work and I can‚Äôt watch her and our son at the same time. To remedy this, I drop off the boy at my parents while I‚Äôm working. My parents love him and I thought I was doing something nice for my wife so she can have time for herself. Well I guess I did the wrong thing because she has been really upset about it and thinks I don‚Äôt trust her with our child. Apparently I‚Äôm making her feel useless. I just was trying to help and she made so many dangerous mistakes with our son already. AITA?",2020-10-15 05:18:46,83,231,0.95,1,24,14,0,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of covid it's been impossible to make friends, my circles consist of my bf and people how I've met through him with whom I'm on hello basis. My partner is my only friend here.

Here's my issue;
I know it's not my partners responsibility to make new friends for me, and I wouldn't really want him to. But I do sometimes get jealous when he goes out with his friends for coffee, drinks, food etc. (We do these things together as well, just us, not why I'm jealous). But I am jealous about his ability to go out and see other people besides me, to have those social events and relationships that I am currently unable to have.
				I've tried to think about solution, but there's no hobbies to pick up near by since everything is still closed. I even tried Bumble BFF but that doesn't seem to be working. I'm really at a loss.

So, WIBTA if I told my partner about me being jealous even though he can't do anything about it and potentially just end up making him feel guilty about going out? I don't want him to feel guilty, or stopping going out, or bringing me with him because that would be awkward. Like I know it's just something I have to suck up and get used to, but it still bothers me every now and then.",2020-11-27 05:10:15,25,6,1.0,5,3,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I [26 F] have been in contact with my paternal grandparents (they live in another state, as does my father) since I was 6/7 ish because my biological father hid my existence from them until my mom sought child support from him. I will just mention quickly they and my biological father are independently wealthy people. 
As I grew older, they visited me more than my father and we formed a bond. I love then very much. We have been exchanging emails a couple times a week since I was in high school. They have sent me boxes for Christmas and my birthday every year, even including gifts for my mom and half-sister (not their grandchild) in the Christmas boxes while I was under 18. They still send me the boxes to my apartment. 
All seems nice, right? 
The boxes have no evolved much over the 2 decades. As a little kid I would tell anyone and everyone I loved cats, favorite animal hands down. I still love cats, the pets. I have never desired to wear or own cat themes items, however. I like the live critters. I have 2 with my SO. They are our babies. 
Every box has at least 5 cat items, be they kitchen towels, clothes, figurines (soooo many figurines), cheap tech accessories, decor, and even this year a cat shaped litter scoop! 
I have told them very nicely I would prefer practical items for my home if they want to send gifts, but of course I don't need any gifts, I genuinely enjoy sharing the emails and cards just fine. They ignore this and send more of the cat things and other unrelated and frankly useless things such as a singular small cheap flashlight printed with the logo of their local fire station. 
?? 
I've never been rude to them or not said ""thank you"", I try hard to be gracious, but I feel unheard and infantilized whenever I tell anyone other than my SO that I'm tired of these unwanted gifts that ultimately just become a trip to goodwill. 

Am I an asshole because I do not ""appreciate"" these gifts enough and wish they would just send money?",2020-11-16 21:33:04,28,24,0.89,1,6,3,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We get along great and have a really loving and supportive relationship. We both recently graduated from a prestigious university, my degree was in engineering, hers was a double major in Spanish and linguistics. We've been long-distance for a couple of months because of the pandemic (both of us living at home so we can save up money).

I recently accepted a really exciting job that will pay me more than I expected ($100k+ , although in a fairly expensive city), and have always had pretty lofty/defined goals for my career and work really hard to reach them. My girlfriend used to be really passionate about things but the more I've gotten to know her, the more I've realized that she doesn't have very many aspirations. She's floated the idea of getting into law but that's as far as it's gone. I'm sure it's a combination of the family she grew up in and her confidence level, but she seems perfectly content working the checkout line at a grocery store. This sort of worries me because a) I know she is still paying off student loans and b) my mom is the same way, no life goals, and hasn't worked for 23 years, let alone last 8 or so since I've been independent enough to not need mothering or the 4 years I was away at college, and I've seen the pressure that puts on my dad to make enough to support the family.

I know my girlfriend is unsure about what kind of career she wants, which is completely understandable, but it seems really foreign to me to have so much potential (a friggin double major at a top school!!) but not have a single goal to work towards besides moving in with me. You definitely don't need to have your whole career planned out at age 20, very few of us do, but almost everyone I know has some sort of goal to work towards even if that goal changes over time. (Isn't the average number of career changes like 5-7!?)

So to the question, WIBTA if I tell her I want to wait to move in together until she has a full-time job or at least a somewhat defined plan for how to move forward with her career? Right now her part time jobs probably put her in the $10-20k salary range with few benefits. I'm not so much worried about the money right now, just that her lack of motivation makes me uneasy about our future (she hasn't applied to or even looked for any full-time jobs in the 6 months since she graduated) and I don't want either of us to end up feeling like she's reliant on my income to get by in an expensive part of the country. If for some reason we break up in the future, she probably wouldn't be able to afford rent in the area, and that would be an awful situation all-around. We have a lot of the same interests outside of work and have a really loving and supportive relationship, but seeing her motivation the past 6 months has made me start to question whether we have compatible long-term goals for life/standard of living/retirement.

Edit for clarification: The way I phrased it originally, it comes of like I'm fixated primarily on the fact that she hasn't found a job or chosen a career. I have tons of friends who are in the same boat. My main concern is actually that she hasn't put in any effort over 6 months or during college to start looking/exploring options, whether that's googling jobs or talking to people in different professions. 

Also lots of comments have said that I'm coming off as very judgmental, which I completely accept. I'll definitely take some time to try to rethink my attitude on some things. Thanks for pointing that out.",2020-11-20 06:28:16,52,4,0.64,0,4,6,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
223,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ijvte2/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_daughter_to_relax_her/,AITA for not paying for my daughter to relax her hair?,"I (37F) have a multi-racial daughter (13). I am black, and her father is white and South Korean. 

Both of us have natural hair. My daughter has very thick, long, and curly hair that reaches to her waist. She has many different curl patterns going on - some parts of her hair are tightly coiled, others are loose curls, and some are in between. I have two patterns on my head - tight coils on the sides, and loose curls at the top. I keep my hair medium length. 

I‚Äôve tried to teach my daughter that how she is naturally is beautiful. I was raised by my self-hating father to believe that light skinned women with long straight hair were desired, and that I wouldn‚Äôt get a job if I looked like ‚ÄúI was from Africa.‚Äù So I had relaxed hair up until college, where my dad still freaked out after I cut all of my hair off and went natural. Therefore, I‚Äôve tried to raise my daughter in a way that promotes self-love and acceptance. 

Recently, my daughter has explained to me that she thinks she‚Äôs not pretty with curly hair. She asked that I spend money to get her hair fully relaxed (permanently straightened by chemicals). I told her that of course she is beautiful with curly hair. 

She says she wants to look more like the women on her father‚Äôs side. When I try to explain to her that she is beautiful and amazing just as she is, she tells me I don‚Äôt understand because no one looks at me and expects me to have straight hair. 

So I tried a different approach of explaining what chemicals do to the hair, and that it‚Äôs irreversible. And that if she wants curly hair again, she will have to cut off the straight ends. She got more upset with me and told me that I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like being ‚Äúmixed.‚Äù 

Her father thinks I should just pay for the relaxer. I told him that is sending a wrong message especially since she seems to want to change her hair because of an insecurity. I said that I refuse to pay for any chemical application, and as a compromise, I will pay to get her hair silk pressed if she really wants to try having straight hair (she has always worn it curly). Of course, this is still not good enough for my daughter. 

Everyone I‚Äôve spoken to thinks I‚Äôm the AH and am being controlling. I don‚Äôt want to control her, but I also don‚Äôt want her to go down this path of permanently changing something about herself because she feels ‚Äúugly.‚Äù I think I might be the AH because it‚Äôs true that I don‚Äôt understand what it‚Äôs like to be multiracial, and that I‚Äôm invalidating her feelings.

I‚Äôm a woman in my mid-30s, married to another woman. My dad passed away when I was still a child and my mom raised me and my sister on her own. She never remarried and is currently living alone.

About a decade ago, my mom was diagnosed with a medical condition that was going to make it impossible for her to live alone after a certain point. I won‚Äôt give any more personal details, but there is no cure. As my sister was then living in another country (and still is), I promised that my mother was going to move in with me eventually. I told this to my now-wife during our second date and was very clear about it from the start. She always seemed to agree and accept that.

The time has come for my mom to move in with us, as it‚Äôs no longer safe for her to live on her own without assistance. My wife is pregnant with our second child and has changed her mind about the situation. She says there‚Äôs not enough room for my mom (kind of true, but we live in a three-bedroom house and the kids can share a room while my mom takes the other one), that money is tight (even if mom is on disability) and so on. I gave her an ultimatum and told her that if she doesn‚Äôt let my mom move in, I will move out and take care of her on my own. We have been arguing for days.

AITA for wanting her to move in?

EDIT: People have asked for more INFO. My wife and I have discussed this several times during our years as a couple. She was initially fine with the idea of our children sharing a room. I will be taking care of my mother and my sister has agreed on sending us money monthly. My mother still has all her cognitive abilities, as her illness is physical. My wife changed her mind once my mother‚Äôs condition worsened and I started making preparations for her to move in.

Anonymous because I‚Äôm not quite sure how to go about this yet, if I should even go about it at all.

My husband and I went to visit my mother (socially distanced/safe), and hired a sitter to watch over the house and our dog. They have watched over them before with no issue, and is absolutely a lovely family friend/person.

Important detail: Before we left, my husband and I made sure to close our closet doors. The reason we do this is because our dog likes to put shoes in her mouth when she gets excited, then ends up leaving them all over the house and makes a mess. We ALWAYS close the closet doors, even if we‚Äôre just leaving for the shopping.

We came back the other day, hung out with the friend for a while, then they were on their way. I went to go to the bathroom in our bedroom when I noticed that my closet door was partially open. I opened it fully and nothing was amiss‚Äîall of my shoes were in order, nothing was moved around, and because I know people will ask: NOTHING WAS MISSING.

I just thought it was kind of weird and went about my unpacking, but there was an inkling at the back of my head to check around the house, so I walked around and discovered:
- our laundry basket wasn‚Äôt in its usual spot
- my husbands uniform wasn‚Äôt where it usually is in the closet
- our bedside drawer was partially open

I could excuse the first two things as maybe our friend doing some personal laundry/using some of our hangers, but I have no idea why they would want to go through our bedside drawer. Everything that they could need‚Äîlaundry pods, chargers, televisions remotes‚Äîis available for them out in the open.

It isn‚Äôt such a big deal for me‚ÄîI trust our friend completely and, after all, nothing was missing‚Äîbut I am a little embarrassed because there were a few personal things in that drawer that I would have rather they didn‚Äôt see. My husband isn‚Äôt upset either, we both just think it‚Äôs kind of odd.

Would I be the asshole if I *politely* confronted our friend and asked why they were snooping around, even if nothing was missing? And WERE they even snooping around, or could I just be overreacting? I just don‚Äôt want to make them potentially uncomfortable, or make a big deal out of nothing!

EDIT: I wouldn‚Äôt ask them because I am upset with them, I just want to satiate my curiosity as to ‚Äúwhy‚Äù. Maybe they thought I was a secret spy or something cool ;)",2020-11-28 02:15:23,20,7,0.82,1,2,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Halfway through the next year right before I turned 17 and she was still 16 she got pregnant (I was stupid, I know) It really wasn‚Äôt ideal but we wanted the baby so we decided to make it work. My parents went ballistic and I pretty much moved in with my girlfriend who‚Äôs family obviously weren‚Äôt thrilled either but were more accepting. We‚Äôd mostly picked out names and were pretty sure we had a boy name and probably girl name. I know these may have changed slightly over the months but at the time we were sure we had the names. 

She ended up miscarrying at about 14 weeks which was obviously pretty rough especially on her but I was pretty upset too and I still have weird feelings about it because I‚Äôd got used to the idea of having a kid that would be 5 now and it‚Äôs sad but I kind of feel I was given a second chance by not becoming a dad at the beginning of my last year of high school so I don‚Äôt know, mixed feelings. My ex and I also broke up about a month after this. I‚Äôm not actively talking to my ex but I have her on social media and we still have 1 or 2 mutual friends and I'm not exactly not talking to her. 

My current girlfriend is pregnant with a boy and she‚Äôs due at the end of October. My ex called me and screamed at me when she found out that the new baby has the same name that we would have given our baby if it had been a boy. I‚Äôd like to add that my dad‚Äôs family has the tradition that the oldest son‚Äôs middle name is the dad‚Äôs name. This didn‚Äôt happen with me because although I‚Äôm the oldest I also had a twin brother and my parents didn‚Äôt want to do that as we were really the same age but gave my younger brother by 2 years my dad‚Äôs name instead. My twin brother died I think of SIDS just before we turned 1 which I also feel weird about because obviously it‚Äôs sad but I really don‚Äôt remember him although sometimes I wonder what it would have been like to have an identical twin, he‚Äôs in all my baby pictures and I mostly can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs him or me. 

So the boy name we picked was a nickname of my twin‚Äôs middle name and my dad‚Äôs name for middle name. I won‚Äôt pretend that I had this name picked out before my ex was even pregnant (you know, because I was 16) but I liked it and she agreed to it. I feel I have every right to use this name but I can kind of see where she‚Äôs coming from it must be weird to lose a baby and then find out your ex is naming their new kid the same name but I don‚Äôt really see it as I‚Äôm in the wrong and I think my ex is being a little unreasonable. I guess it would be different if it had been her favourite name ever but the fact is the meaning behind the name was connected to my family. 

My ex is also upset that I consider my new baby to be my first child but I don‚Äôt ever really plan on telling my kid that he could have had an older sibling. I don‚Äôt know, I can see how this is an emotional situation for my ex but I kind of want an outside opinion, AITA?",2020-10-01 03:52:51,112,563,0.94,7,13,25,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know that this is not the right place to post this. I tried to post this in r?AskAnAmerican but they didn't let me. There are just too much words. But I really need answers right now.

I'm originally from the Philippines and I've been living in the States for 3 years now. I decided to post this because I was still bothered by what happened in my workplace a few hours ago. So I work at CVS pharmacy as a cashier and there was this black dude who wants to have his dollar changed into quarters. I didn't know what I did wrong but he called me a racist back at my workplace. So the story goes like this :

Him : Hello, can change my 1 dollar into quarters? I need coins to load my water bottle from the water machine. (This is not the exact words that he said but it has the same idea)

Me : Yeah sure! (proceeds to do his request)

Me : This is for the water right?

Him : I'm sorry what?

Me : I said, this is for the water right?

Him : Why are you asking me that? That's what I said earlier

Me : (I struggled to answer him back at this point because my English speaking proficiency is not that good so I just said : ""I was just making sure"" (You see, I was just trying to make a small conversation to the customer that's why I asked him that even though I know that he needs the coins for the water)

He then proceeds to go outside and try to refill his water bottle

Then, a few minutes later, he went back and told me this :

Him : Sir, you might not realized this but what you did earlier is where racism come from. I don't know, it might be just a cultural difference but what you did was racist!

Me : (I don't know what I did wrong at this point but I can see in his face that he was serious and that he look offended. I didn't mean to hurt his feeling so I just decided to apologize)

As Americans, who really understood your own culture, what did I do wrong in that situation. Am I insensitive? Was my question a micro aggression?

My family consists of myself (21M), my sister (34F), and my parents (61M and 55F). I thought it would be cool to research our family tree to see how far back I could get and possibly create a gift to give to my parents. While researching I came across a suspicious birth record. 21 years ago on my exact date of birth a 13 year old female with my sister's name gave birth to a boy. The records are from a state where my parents have occasionally mentioned having lived before I was born. Now I'll admit it's possible that this is just a huge coincidence, but with everything lining up so perfectly I have a strong suspicion that my ""sister"" is actually my birth mother and that my ""parents"" are my grandparents who opted to take the parental role and raise us as siblings.

My family have shown me nothing but the greatest love and support that anyone could ever ask for. If all of this is true I don't want to do anything that would massively change or damage my relationship with them. I don't believe that my perception would change but I'm worried that me knowing might cause them feelings of embarrassment or shame? I don't know if those are the right words to describe it but I doubt it would be a positive reaction.

I've talked about it with one friend and they think I should tell them, if only so that my family doesn't have to keep their guards up about the story around me or for the possibility that they could even disprove my wild claims. I'm still really feeling conflicted about the whole thing. WIBTA if I tell my family what I found?

EDIT: Oh wow this got more attention than I thought it would. Thanks everyone for your advice. I live a few states away from everyone so unfortunately I won't be able to give an update anytime soon. After considering all of your advice I've decided the best course of action is to ask my mom first in a private 1 on 1 conversation. I figure that if something traumatic did happen then she would have the least at stake. I don't suspect my dad of any wrongdoing at all but I suppose there's always the slightest of chances. My dad and sister both have a great relationship and I don't think I've ever seen her try to avoid our dad at all. Still, I'll tread lightly.

My boyfriend(23m) took me(21f) to his parents house an hour away thanksgiving night to have dessert with them. The problem is, we have been dating more than a year and a half and I‚Äôve only met his mom once at a store for a brief second and his sister and a group of us had gone to the movies once before. This would have been my first time actually getting to meet everyone without worldly distractions. 
Note: I have anxiety that comes with a panic disorder and depression. 
So he drove an hour to come get me, an hour back to his parents and everything was fine the whole trip there until we were parked outside of the house. Panic set in and I cried in the car for almost 45 minutes feeling trapped. At first I was too anxious to go in, then after a while too embarrassed to, and couldn‚Äôt just leave? They knew we were there. 
He ended up going in and letting his family know   What was going on then did take me all the way back home. Before leaving, his mom sent him out with apple pie and asked for me to try again sometime. He was as always understanding and kind to me, and tried to reassure me that it was okay. But now i am so humiliated by myself, and I feel like such a shitty person for doing this to everyone. I feel that i could have ruined this relationship only on my end, because now i dont know how to move past this. I‚Äôm feeling like I have no choice but to leave the relationship, because in my eyes I was a massive asshole. 
So I came here to ask, Is this something that could be looked past or am I right in thinking I was too much of an asshole to make a come back.

I don‚Äôt remember when or how it happened but it happened sometime when I was 9 years old which I don‚Äôt think is old enough to be making such a life changing choice, but it happened. I started regretting it when I was 12 and did want to take it off but have been afraid of the social backlash (I live in a close knit Muslim community) and just the confrontation and telling my mom that I don‚Äôt want to wear it anymore.

I have been pushing it back every year since I have contemplated it because i‚Äôve been so scared. To say that I will greatly disappoint my mother is an understatement, she will be completely devastated. I‚Äôve struggled with my faith a lot and she knows that and she voices her frustrations at me not being the best possible Muslim and I feel like me doing this will just cement her worries. I‚Äôve talked to my sister about it and she supports me and told me that although my mom will probably be disappointed, she‚Äôll still love me no matter what.

I know i‚Äôm going to hurt her and our relationship probably won‚Äôt be the same but i‚Äôm 20 and as shallow as it may sound I want to look pretty and take advantage of my youth without feeling regret when i‚Äôm older. I feel like wearing the hijab not only confines me but i‚Äôm not even wearing it because I want to. I‚Äôm wearing it for my mom and that‚Äôs not right. I don‚Äôt want to go behind her back and take it off because lying about it would make it 100x worse so I feel like I need to come clean. However I have worn it for 11 years and she‚Äôll be so heartbroken at me doing this so many years later.

So reddit, I need your help. WIBTA If I told my mom i‚Äôm not going to wear a hijab (headscarf) anymore?



Edit- Wow I just woke up and wanted to say thank you al for the kind comments and love, everyone has been so kind and understanding for the most part. I will eventually talk to my mom but I‚Äôm going to wait a bit more until the circumstances are right, and less crazy since everything seems to be a mess and once I do I will make an update post! Also, although I haven‚Äôt read all of them yet I really appreciate everyone who took the time to say something or give advice, thank you!!",2020-09-07 15:44:44,230,1961,0.95,0,15,106,0,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,

I supported her, let her know I'd be there, etc.  Usual ally stuff.

However, she told me she was going to come out to the whole world this week.  I let her know she should absolutely wait for her grandparents (my parents) to pass.  My father is incredibly wealthy and has tens of millions of dollars in assets that he will be passing down once he is gone.

My father is a raging homophobe who has flat out stated any gay individual in our family would be written out of the will.  And to make sure the rest of us don't just split more money with said gay relative, they will, instead, have that portion of the inheritance (put aside for that family member) donated to charitable causes.  That money will be erased from the inheritance.

Since both my father and mother are incredibly poor health, (stage 4 cancer and debilitating dementia respectively) I told my niece she should stay in the closet for a while longer.  If she comes out as a lesbian and they find out, she will quite literally lose out on 7 million dollars.

She was a little sad but was also appreciative since that is obviously a life-changing amount of money that will allow her to live luxuriously until she dies.

My wife, however, said that I am being an asshole.  I am telling this poor girl to hide who she is just to appease old bigots.  That is true, I am asking her to appease old bigots.  But I feel like her life quality will be much better with 7 million dollars at the cost of 1-2 years in the closet at tops.

I have also seen my father's will and know who is getting what, so my niece IS definitely going to receive 7 million as long as my father doesn't rewrite or edit his will.

Am I the asshole for telling my niece to stay in the closet so she can be a millionaire?

**Small update: my wife apologized for getting snippy with me and now agrees she should hide it for a year or two.  She is a powerful advocate of LGBTQ+ rights so she had an angry knee-jerk reaction to my dad's bigotry.**",2020-06-16 21:57:04,2402,28199,0.96,1,29,64,0,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,1,1

I (35 F) moved a few years ago to a Midwest state and recently had a baby.  I haven‚Äôt allowed any of my friends or family to come because of covid and they would have to fly here.  I relented and am allowing my sister to come visit in 2 months (baby will be 4 months by then) and she will be taking as many precautions as she can.  She and I also asked my SIL if my niece (12 F) can come. My SIL was upset because the whole family wants to come and it would be unfair if just my niece gets to meet the baby and not her brothers as well.  I said my SIL can come as well, but 3 people max and then I added that I brought out all her kids over the summer for 2 weeks and the boys were on their phones non stop and since then only my niece responds to my texts (we actually chat every day.  I text the boys as well but they respond maybe once a week) and that I diddnt want to pay to fly everyone out here for them to just sit on their phones.  

She has informed me she is still upset, but I really can‚Äôt afford to pay for everyone to come out here.  Maybe I am the asshole and should just say no one can come since everyone can‚Äôt. 

To be clear I love them all and do a lot of things with them, I just don‚Äôt want to pay a lot for them to sit around and stare at their phones again.",2020-10-22 17:47:10,52,194,0.94,1,3,20,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My wife (26f) and I got by okay whenever she had a job before as well (she was a starbucks barista), but since then her fibromyalgia has gone into a series of bad flares and she's come to the conclusion that she just can't work anymore. I don't know what that pain is like so I can't exactly argue with her. I decided that if she tried to get disability pay and take care of the apartment, we should be okay with just my income until I get a raise. 

What I didn't know is just how long a process getting disability pay is. And how expensive everything is. And how I consistently only have like $100 free between paychecks, to be instantly spent on home needs. We had food stamps for a while, but I put her in charge of those and we apparently don't know the status of it? 

Basically, I wanted really hard to be the cool husband who can take care of everything, but I've flown too close to the sun. 

Flash to now and I'm working myself to the bone, tired all the time. The apartment barely gets taken care of, I guess I get it when she's always in pain but my job is physical so so am I, yknow? We're always broke, I'm always tired. I asked her to look for work from home jobs and she said she isn't qualified for any of them. I asked her to try math tutoring or guitar lessons and she hasn't put up any ads or found any listings. I don't know how to navigate this while salvaging my relationship. 

Literally anything I do here is gonna cause tension but I guess I gotta know, WIBTA if I asked her to just suck it up and get a new IRL job? I feel like thats insensitive to someone with chronic pain but I don't know anymore, I'm just so tired.",2020-09-25 12:29:08,169,407,0.95,0,20,33,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One, oxtail is very flavorful but needs time to braise, using coconut milk takes a long time to thicken up, and braising oxtail in my curry would flavor it very nicely. This all works together since I need to cook for a long time to get the coconut milk to thicken and the oxtail to be tender and all the while it will flavor the curry beautifully.

Queue my picky girlfriend who wants me to use chicken. She says she is a pollo vegetarian but I don't think she actually is. She likes beef hamburgers, beef in her soup, bolognese sauce,  her steaks bloody. What I really think is going on is that she's just picky, because she is in general. She says oxtail is something no one eats and when o say plenty of people eat it outside North America she replies with ""not me"". She's never tried it. She also says beef curry is gross and when I asked her how many times she's tried it she said never but she just thinks it will be gross.

I am passionate about cooking. I love trying new things and I don't like being limited to the most generic cuts of meat and chicken and ingredients. So wpuld i be the asshole if i used beef?",2020-10-24 13:34:17,91,51,0.87,6,5,14,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The person who owns this print had blacked out a box for every week he had already lived. Looking at life this way really helped me to put my worries into perspective and become more motivated to make a success out of my life and stop wasting time. 

I sent a picture of the print to a few friends, and asked their thoughts on it. I understood that it may make some people feel a little uncomfortable reflecting upon their mortality in this way but the feedback I got was much worse than I could have imagined. One friend was very kind about it but said that she had 'Thatnotophohia' which after I googled it means she has a severe phobia of death. I felt pretty bad about this and apologised immediately. Had I known that she had this phobia, I wouldnt have sent it. 

I spoke about the situation with another friend who called me an asshole for sending it to her, and to my other friend who has Thatnotophobia. 

I think I may be the asshole because I didnt really think that it could have such a negative effect on some people and maybe I should have. I think that maybe I'm not the asshole because everybody is aware that they will die someday, and I did ask the question with genuine intentions.

I‚Äôve never gotten a single positive pregnancy test. After a year of trying we went to the doctor and they said my eggs were of low quality. We‚Äôve been considering IVF but it‚Äôs very expensive of course. This has been really hard on us but we've been trying to make the best of it. I hadn‚Äôt taking a pregnancy test in about 3 months.  

I was hanging out with a group of my close friends at my best friend‚Äôs house. Kind of a girl‚Äôs night thing we do. I was complaining that I  was feeling noxious and tired. My best friend pulled me aside and asked if it was possible if I was pregnant.  I said probably not but I admitted I hadn‚Äôt taken a pregnancy test in a while. She insisted I take a pregnancy test since people were drinking at our gathering and although I didn‚Äôt really want to she had a bunch of extra tests at her place so I took one. It was shockingly positive. Obviously I was super excited because I have never gotten a positive test in my life. I took another one right away that showed how many weeks along you were and it said I was over 3 weeks pregnant. I was just in a state of shock and basically crying and all my closest friends were at her house and there was no way I could keep silent so I ended up telling everyone at the gathering. Everyone was super happy for me and we spent most of the night talking about my pregnancy. I didn‚Äôt call my husband right away because I wanted to tell him to his face and he was on a short business trip so he wouldn‚Äôt be back until the next day. However, I did tell him that I have a surprise for him when he get home. 

So as soon as he got home from his business trip I told him I was pregnant. He was ecstatic and we celebrated for about 10 minutes but then he asked me how many people knew and I told him all the girls who I was with knew and he became angry. He said it was weird that 12 people who I‚Äôm not related to knew before he did and I should have told him first and then was angry I waited a day to tell him.  I was a little put off by how angry he was as I felt he was taking away from a joyous moment for no reason. Ideally he would have been the first to know but it didn‚Äôt work out that way. He said that I should have called him immediately instead of waiting a day and should not told the other people at the party. I find this a bit ridiculous. He then got angry because I wouldn‚Äôt apologize but I honestly don‚Äôt think I did anything wrong. He thinks this is an example of how I put my friends over him.

My grandmother passed away and left me one of her rings. It is really not my style so I don‚Äôt wear it. I thought about bringing it to a jeweler to see if it can be made into another piece of jewelry so I can use it rather than have it sit in my jewelry box.
