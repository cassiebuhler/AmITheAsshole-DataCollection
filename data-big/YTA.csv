My girlfriend (34F) is a preschool teacher and for some reason I can’t explain she dresses like Ms. Frizzle. Like a dress with the pattern of whatever they are studying. She makes a lot of them herself, now including matching masks. The kids love it, and the parents seem to think it’s great. I don’t like the amount of attention she gets honestly. I’d prefer if she came home and changed before running any errands.

On Friday, she helped my mom with something after work and she was still in her weird dress. I have told her before I don’t like when she dresses that way, but she tells me I don’t have to like it, but I have no right to tell her how to dress. I was upset she went out like that with my mother, and told her that my mom said she was embarrassed and to ask that she please not dress like that again if they’re going out. I was not expecting her to call my mom and apologize. When my mom asked what she meant, she told her what I said. My mom was furious, explained she doesn’t have a problem with how my girlfriend dresses and thinks it’s great she spends extra time doing things to engage her students. My mom then yelled at me for lying to my girlfriend and trying to throw her under the bus because I was being an insecure jerk.

My girlfriend and I got into a huge fight. I said she should be embarrassed to be seen in public like that. She said the only thing she was embarrassed by was me. She hasn’t spoken to me or done anything for me since. My friend said I was horrible and called me trash. I shouldn’t have lied, but I think my girlfriend should take what I think about her clothes into consideration and I’m not sorry for expecting her dress more appropriately in public. Am I really such an asshole here?

EDIT: I’m sure you all will be pleased to know we broke up tonight. She said I’m to controlling and narrow minded so she broke up with me.  ",2020-11-10 20:07:07,5753,18831,0.8,129,1,0,0,3,1,4,1,4,4,1,2,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He is kind of disorganized so I tend to have to tidy things up a lot. He often complains that I ""misplace"" his things, but it's really just his lack of organization more than anything. He keeps telling me to stop moving his things around, but we live here together so I don't see why I should stop doing that.

Anyway, he happens to be the one who does most of the cooking, and I'd say he's pretty good at it. One thing that does bother me is that he keeps multiple huge bags of rice in the kitchen, which he claims are different types of rice. But I looked at them and they're all just the same white rice. I told him that he should put it in a proper container, but he insists that it's just fine the way it is. But the thing is, I don't think that it's fine the way it is.

So yesterday, I decided to consolidate all of the rice by getting a huge tub to put all of the rice in. I dumped all three bags in there and put it in the pantry. When I texted my boyfriend and told him where I put the rice, he completely freaked out and said that I ""ruined"" the rice. He texted me that I can't mix basmati rice with jasmine rice, but it's all just white rice! I don't see how it's any less edible. When he came home he just started yelling at me, and it was really hurtful because I was doing him a favor.

My dad bailed when I was a baby and I was just my mom and I after that. I was often jealous of friends who would have big family celebrations. My wife and I have three children Alice (27F) Jeff (24M) and Kevin (22M)—Fake names. I always thought my kids would spend all the holidays with us, because I always stressed how important it was to me to have them all home with me. 

I did a zoom call with the three yesterday and they broke the news to me that none of them would be coming home for Thanksgiving. I got upset and Alice interrupted me to remind me that she and Jeff worked in fields and that they would sometimes have to work holidays. (She’s a x-ray technician in a hospital and Jeff is a dispatcher for 911) and that she was married now and she knew I wanted us all home for every holiday but that just wasn’t realistic. I asked Kevin what his excuse was and he said he was going to stay with his girlfriend because she just had surgery and wanted to care for her.

I said they needed to get their priorities straight and they knew it was important to their mother and I that they attend. Jeff said that my wife understood and I was the one who constantly tried to guilt trip them into rearranging their lives to make me happy and he hated that I refused to let them live their lives without trying to guilt trip them into doing what I want. Alice said it wasn’t up for discussion and I could either accept they wouldn’t always be there or I could celebrate without her from here on out because she was done dealing with me trying to make her feel guilty for having a life. They disconnected after that.

I am very upset, and think I deserve more respect than this, but my wife says it’s unreasonable to think the kids would always come home and just because I wanted something didn’t mean it was going to happen and I needed to stop acting like an asshole to get my way.

I guess she wasn't a good mom the first time around, very neurotic and controlling, and she wanted a do over baby. I mean i've heard some horror stories about her, and she can be kind of a narc in general, but I love my mom. I had a baby girl six months ago and named her Kalia, in honor of my mom, Lia.

My older siblings were pissed. My brother kept making comments about that poor baby, and why didn't i just name her Jezebel. His wife was annoyed about how she is automatically going to be the favorite, and my sister took it the worst. She got very mad at me, saying my mom doesn't deserve that and it isn't fair.

Despite the weird dynamic with our mom, we do get along for the most part. They are always nice to Kalia, but they call her K or baby. I really don't like K and I want her called Kalia. I brought it up nicely and my brother said he can't say the word Lia without wanting to gag, and my sister said it makes her mad every time she says it. I said i'm sorry, but it is her name.

They continue to call her K, which my mom has picked up on, and it hurts her, but most importantly it isn't her name. Kalia is her own person and has nothing to do with whatever my mom did years ago. I finally told them if they can't call her by her name, they can't be around her, so i won't be inviting them to my house or letting them have much of an aunt/uncle roll.

We have 3 sons in their 20s and 30s, the older two are married and the oldest has a 1-year old son. We all live within an hour of each other, but due to the pandemic we have not gotten together much the last 6 months. We even had to do a zoom call for my grandson's 1st birthday since his parents didn't want a group gathering. With Thanksgiving coming up, we have all been staying home and taking every precaution so that we can all get together for the holiday. My oldest son and his wife will be hosting.

The other day in the family group chat, my two DILs and my wife were venting about the pandemic and how hard and exhausting it all has been trying to juggle working from home, childcare, family, etc.  I made a lighthearted joke about them toughening up and told them all to grow a pair. My oldest son's wife sent a long message about how that kind of language is damaging and that if I ever said anything like that to her son, that it would be the last thing I said to him. She also sent a link to an article about toxic masculinity.  

I read the article and then sent my DIL a private message telling her that I read it but that I don't agree with it and she should stop whining. She didn't respond, so the next morning I sent her another message telling her we should strive to have a complaint-free day.  She didn't respond to that either.  

Well last night, my oldest son called to tell us that they will no longer be hosting Thanksgiving. He said that their daycare had a covid scare and they have to get their son tested. He said that they no longer want to host and will be staying home as a family instead. My wife is very upset by this as she loves family holidays and not having all her sons around this year has been very hard on her. 

I called my son to tell him this and to try to change his mind. I told him that as long as their son tests negative, that there is no reason we can't all still get together. I told him that we have all been staying home and taking precautions and I didn't want that to be for nothing and that his mother is distraught over this. He told me this wasn't a debate or a negotiation, he and his wife have made their decision. He then said he loved me but that I'm an asshole and should stop whining and complaining then he hung up.

My wife is still very upset that we won't see everyone for the holiday, but now she's also pissed off at me because apparently my son and DIL told her what I said to DIL and my wife agrees with them that I was a jerk.",2020-11-17 15:00:26,1882,9768,0.91,216,0,0,0,1,,1,,,,,3,2,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ordinarily I would have told my wife but the situation ultimately was a misunderstanding and something I was able to quickly resolve with the restaurant owner.

He and his friends had gone out to eat at this place, and apparently my son decided to make a joke and hit on their waitress. Others said things too but his was the one that upset her and resulting in her telling the owner. It wasn't a bad joke or what I'd consider sexist, but it was in poor taste. When she told the owner, he got upset and asked the boys to leave.

They were all embarrassed and told us that they left because they weren't feeling well instead of the real reason. At least at first. My son told me what really happened, and one of his friends ended up also telling his mom the truth after she questioned his story. By the time he confessed, I'd already talked with my son and the owner of the restaurant and worked things out. My son and the rest of the boys aren't banned from the restaurant and everything is fine now.

I saw no need to involve my wife in this because she would have escalated this when our son was already embarrassed and had learned his lesson. There wasn't anything else to say or do.

My wife disagrees and thinks I am the asshole for hiding the truth from her and for enabling our son's sexism, as she puts it. She doesn't think I've actually done anything except teach him that he can say and do what he wants without consequences. This is because I didn't punish him and convinced the restaurant owner to ""look the other way."" In this case I didn't feel more needed to be said or done because what he said wasn't that bad and he seemed sorry.

Now that the other parents know what happened everyone is split. Most of the dads agree with me and have similar views while the moms are taking the same view as my wife. So am I the asshole?

Edit: Since some are asking for the joke.  The waitress they had was Indian, so my son said that he no longer felt like he was in the mood for Italian and wanted that instead. He then asked her if she could help him with that. ",2020-11-20 00:44:14,1806,8176,0.89,284,0,0,1,,,1,,,,1,1,1,2,,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I M37 am currently dealing with a horrible situation. My dad was Admitted to the hospital and is in need of a heart surgery that he should've gotten months ago. He's already dealing with complications and his cardiologist recommeneded the surgery sooner.

Both my wife and I work. We have a joint account that we both use but she contributes more because she has been saving up to renovate the house. She knows about my dad's condition and we both discussed the possibilty of giving my family money to help with the cost of the surgery. She told me that I needed to do all i can to help my dad. Last week I was able to pull out 10k from our account and put it into my family's account then i told them about it. My wife found out after she contacted the bank the next day not giving me the chance to tell her myself as if she was checking to see if i took any money from the account and she blew up on me when i got home after visiting my family.

She called me a thief and a liar which was a shock for me and I was really hurt by that. Especially when she told me i needed to support my family. She told me that i shouldn't have given my family 10k saying it was a lot and that she now can't renovate the house with the money left in the account.

She said that I threw away the hard work to save up money and kept lashing out on me the entire day.

She's expecting me to return the money saying she was the one who contributed more and that my family should start thinking of fixing their own problems instead of asking for money.",2020-11-26 14:49:56,1272,4767,0.92,223,1,0,1,,,,,1,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have a daughter and a stepson who I will call Carly and Kyle \[Carly-15 & Kyle-18\]. They have never been particularly close. Kyle tends to avoid myself and Carly like the plague, he hasn't bothered ever trying to build a relationship with us.

I have been with Kyle's dad since the kids were 10 & 13. Due to some personal troubles which I'll not go to into detail about, Kyle stays with his dad though his mother will visit fairly regularly and they are in constant contact. She, of course, believes me to be the asshole in this situation.

Kyle has stayed in the attic since I knew him. His parents had the attic converted into a proper bedroom for him when he was around 9 or 10. It is an absolutely stunning room. Plenty of space, nice furniture and it is currently inhabited by several dressmaking dummies as he is studying fashion at university.

Lately, Carly has asked me if she can stay with me full time. She and her dad are just not getting on and she'd prefer living with me. Her dad is absolutely fine with this as he was never really good with her in the first place. This means that the majority of Carly's things will be at our place. She has a lot more things than Kyle and would most likely need more space. That's why I thought it'd be a better idea to have Kyle move into Carly's slightly smaller bedroom downstairs and Carly can move into the attic bedroom. I even offered to pay for whatever Kyle wants for his new bedroom \[regarding wallpaper, paint, posters etc.\] as I know it is a bit of a change for him.

Kyle is not a fan of the idea and has been complaining about how he needs the space to work on his uni projects. I told him that he is more than welcome to use the dining room as we rarely ever use it and we can clean out one of the storage cupboards to store the dummies in. Kyle's partner is also not a fan of this though I am almost 100 percent sure that this is just because in the attic bedroom, they can do what teenagers do without interruption. I think that Kyle is being a bit over dramatic about this as I'm not kicking him out into the street, just into a smaller bedroom, which I have offered to decorate for him.

His father is not completely sold on the idea but is slowly coming around. He also thinks that Kyle is being a bit dramatic regarding the room situation. Kyle's mother and girlfriend and of course Kyle himself, all think that I'm being an asshole.

Am I the Asshole?

Edit -

The people who are bringing up Kyle paying rent. He pays us £100 dig money per month. He wanted to start paying rent to help his dad out, we did not force him and we will be expecting Carly to start paying rent when she'd old enough too so that Kyle is not singled out.

Yes, Kyle's dad did cheat on his ex with me. His ex wife was in a bad place and it put a lot of stress on Kyle's dad. I had not long divorced my husband \[Carly's dad\] and was in a bad place. We got drunk and did something stupid. Neither of us intended for it to turn into anything more. But it did. I regret my comment about how Kyle's mum should've got her shit together, I was a bit stressed when I wrote that.

Lastly, regarding the absurd claims that I am biphobic/homophobic. I am not. My brother is a gay man and one of my best friends is a bisexual gentleman. Kyle's relationship up until this point have barely made it past two months. He sleeps around when he's not in a relationship with someone \[thankfully not in the house as that can be dangerous\]. I do not want Carly thinking this behaviour is okay as I know how dangerous it can be. Kyle is not my son, he has made that abundantly clear, but I have provided him with condoms in the past to make sure he stays safe. I just don't want Carly to start acting like him.

Finally, you'll all be very glad to know that I'm not pushing the subject any further. Kyle can keep his room. I'll just tell Carly that she's going to get rid of her belongings. Thank you.

Second and last edit - 

I was stressed when I wrote about making Carly get rid of her things. She's going to put her thing in the storage cupboard and the dining room. I wouldn't make my child throw her things away, I was just angry. Also my worries about Kyle are on now way the same as what happened with his dad and I. We were drunk, it was a stupid mistake that turned into something more. I was not sleeping around, Kyle's dad was the only one that it happened with. Kyle has multiple sexual partners and I worry that he isn't being safe all the time and that this could be a bad influence on Carly. 

Kyle is keeping his bedroom. Carly is making do with the smaller bedroom. She has also found the thread and is upset with the amount of hate she is getting in the comments. Does it make you lot feel good to make a teenage girl cry? You guys can call me whatever you want, I might even deserve it, but my daughter has done nothing wrong. Though I'll be sure to let Kyle know that you lot have deemed him ""Mister Perfect"". ",2020-11-13 18:48:39,2881,5864,0.85,203,0,1,1,1,,1,1,1,,1,3,2,1,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My wife is pregnant and has told me that she wants her sister in the delivery room. She is only allowed one person, so this means I'm out and won't be with her when she gives birth to our baby. It would be an understatement to say that I was disappointed, crushed, hurt, etc. when she told me this is what she was thinking. I had been excited about being there with her and experiencing that moment ever since she told me she was pregnant - really even since we started trying to get pregnant. I just always assumed she would want me there. Note the distinction here between me expecting to be there versus expecting her to want me there. I am pointing this out because what's worse than the disappointment is her rejecting me and basically telling me that she feels like someone else could give her better support while giving birth. That's really made me feel like a POS and worthless husband and father.

I've tried not to take it to heart or personally, but I don't know how else to take that kind of rejection. It doesn't help that she's really given no reason for why she feels like her sister would do a better job of supporting her. I know that her sister has had kids herself, but when I asked my wife if that was part of it she said not really. I then asked her if I had done something wrong or failed in some way or if she was upset with me, and she said it wasn't anything I'd done and she wasn't trying to punish me. She just felt like it would be better to have her sister there. I've asked for clarifications and that's as specific as she gets. It doesn't seem like she has a real list of reasons why her sister was chosen. It's just a feeling. Either that or she is lying to me and won't give me the real reason.

I had hoped she'd change her mind, but she's now confirmed this is how it will be. All of the things I've written about led me to tell her that if she really feels that way then I think it'd be better if her sister or someone else drove her to the hospital. Otherwise I'm just her taxi driver.

Once she realized that I was serious she lost it and told me I was acting like a child and pouting. I can accept that it's her choice, but if she doesn't want my support in the delivery room then why would she want it on the way to the hospital or at any other time? That's illogical, so there's no point in me doing that either.

She decided to go stay with her family for a few days and since she has I am being constantly bombarded by both sides of the family and friends of ours telling me to let this go and stop being an asshole. I know they are trying to help, but I don't think they understand the situation and just want it resolved so they can all feel better. Just looking to confirm if I am as bad as they think I am.

&#x200B;

Edit: I appreciate the comments, even the ones that were harsh, but as it turns out this post is moot. After talking with some of you last night, I reached out to my wife this morning about the state of things and our relationship. Mostly I wanted to know if she was planning to come home any time soon. She said that she wasn't, as I had suspected. She confirmed what I'd guessed which is that she has no plans to come back any time soon, so someone in her family will be driving her anyway. I'm not really upset by that. I still feel it's for the best and I think she does too. We'll see what happens after the baby is born but I don't think it's likely we'll stay together, and given our differences and differing views on marriage that may be for the best anyway. I feel like our relationship has run it course and we're not a good fit for each other. I had already contacted a divorce attorney just to discuss a possible separation and things I might need to do to prepare for divorce, so I'll go ahead and start making plans assuming we're divorcing. I probably will end up doing a paternity test so I can confirm the baby is actually mind since some of your are saying you don't believe it is.

I don't think I'm the asshole necessarily but I want to get some other perspectives.

A while back my girlfriend's friend paid off her student loans and decided to celebrate by taking one month of loan payments' worth of money and treating some friends out to dinner. There were 6 of us, including her. The most important thing to understand here is that when we all sat down, she told us the money was specifically set aside for this dinner, so please order whatever we wanted. She also ordered several appetizers for the table and said she would pay for up to 2 alcoholic drinks per person. The restaurant was a midrange steakhouse.

When it got to me I ordered the ribeye which was NOT the most expensive item on the menu. From previous conversations with my girlfriend I knew that the friend's monthly loan payment was $500, so she had that amount set aside for the dinner. 500 ÷ 6 ≈ 83 so with 6 people, everyone could spend up to $83 without going over the amount set aside for the dinner. I did some quick mental math on what everyone had ordered and we were still well below that threshold, so I felt comfortable adding a lobster tail to my meal. Very important note: My entrees did not exceed $83.

No one said anything about it, but my girlfriend lit into me when we got home and said I embarrassed her and that I took advantage of her friend. I told her that her friend had said to get whatever we wanted and I explained to her that the math worked out so it was okay.

My girlfriend's argument is that ""get whatever you want"" doesn't mean a second entree and that I should have gotten the surf and turf if I wanted lobster. My belief is that ""get whatever you want"" means exactly that, that I did my due diligence in making sure the cost wouldn't go over the amount she had set aside, and that the friend had set aside that money specifically for the dinner so she wasn't expecting to have any of it left.

So for some background, I (34M) have two siblings, a brother (30M) and little sister (23F). For the purpose of this post, we’ll call them Paul and Abby. 

When we were younger, our mom had this rule that every morning and before we went to bed, we should give each other a hug. I asked my mom about it when I got older, and she said her parents had a similar rule and she thought it made her and her siblings closer. 

Eventually, around the time I went to college, Paul and I stopped hugging every day because I found it pretty awkward. However, up until now, I would hug Abby (whenever we were together anyway). Paul does the same. 

Currently, all of us live together. Last night, my girlfriend (35F) was staying over, and we were sitting on the couch. Abby said she was going to bed, so I gave her a hug. After my she went inside, my GF said that it was really weird and that I was babying Abby. She told me I shouldn’t hug Abby anymore. 

This morning, when Abby tried to hug me, I told her she shouldn’t anymore, because she’s grown up now and it’s kind of weird. Abby just said okay, then left. She didn’t really talk to me for the rest of the day. It’s been pretty awkward, because all of us are home all the time, since her school and our work is all online.

I truly don’t care about this — as long as there’s no unhealthy relationship with food, I could not care less about how she looks. 

I have, however, always taught her not to be wasteful. She’s been running longer and longer distances, and I’m proud of her. For thanksgiving, I baked a big batch of cookies today and told my husband and kids they could have some today if they wanted. She got hole from her run as I was taking a fresh batch out of the oven, and she sat down and ate one. 

I asked her how her run was, and she said it was good and that she’d run 5 miles in 45 minutes. I was impressed, especially since she had lifted weights this morning, and said “are you sure you wanna throw away all your hard work with that cookie?” She asked what I meant, and I said that I’m not judging, just asking if she really wants to undo her run. 

She said “well, it sure sounded like a judgement. A cookie isn’t gonna ‘undo my run’, and I’d appreciate you not commenting on what I eat”. She went upstairs after that, and I just don’t understand her reaction. I was just concerned about her, because I feel like she wasted a lot of effort just to have a cookie afterwards.

Wooden bed frame with headboard, dresser, two night stands, a storage ottoman, a vanity table, and a bookcase. I bought decent quality stuff so that it would last, and it has. When I moved in with my now husband, we had to get a larger bed anyway and he wanted ""fresh"" stuff, so there was the question of what to do with my furniture. 

My daughter was turning 4 and was starting to grow out of her crib/toddler bed anyway, so I arranged it in what would be her room, and moved her out of her crib to that. There was only one room aside from the master that would fit the set, so she ended up with the larger of the two other upstairs bedrooms. My husband's two older daughters would be sharing a room, and the even smaller bedroom off of the finished basement would be a guestroom/office.

Since the 3rd upstairs room is smaller, we have bunkbeds in there to save space. The girls have now seen that my daughter not only has a bigger room but has ""grown-up"" furniture and they and their mother are launching accusations of favoritism. This just isn't true. 

They are adamant that we should at the very least be putting her in a twin sized bed instead of having one child be a ""literal queen"" with a larger bed or even throw out an entire set of furniture to move her into the smaller room and have the two older girls share the larger room. That's so expensive and wasteful, and I just don't see the point.

1. They're only here 50% of the time. I don't see the point of dedicating the larger bedroom or two separate bedrooms to kids who are only here half of the time. 

2. This furniture wasn't bought specifically for her, and this is the only bedroom it would fit in with space to walk around. It literally has to go in this room or be thrown away. 

3. While it is more ""adult"" she will be able to grow into it instead of us constantly having to update furniture as she grows out of it. The furniture is also less than 7 years old, so throwing it away would be wasteful. 

Am I just seeing this wrong? My daughter's father (the only other person IRL this has been discussed with yet) and I were both only children, but even still throwing away perfectly fine furniture because of perception would just not happen. It's just a bedroom set.",2020-11-25 11:42:04,1208,3047,0.92,255,0,4,3,,1,,,,,1,2,,1,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was very messy. I didn't know at the time but they had a real Charles-Diana-Camilla thing going on and after years of watching my dad love another woman my mother finally cracked and divorced him. It was acrimonious and it did a lot of damage to me that I'm working out in therapy.

My father married his mistress 30 days after the divorce between he and mom was made final. Ultimately ""Angie"" couldn't handle things (my parent's friends and my mom bad-mouthed her in our small town, I was a little shit head, my dad's parents and family were awful to her, she was put through the wringer) and the marriage fell apart after 2 years. I never saw her after that. My dad never really moved on from Angie, turns out he really loved her. 

I'm now in my 20's and my therapist suggested I talk to the people in my life connected to the divorce. My father was happy to talk, mom was reticent. I found Angie, she lives a town over. I sent her a message on FB asking to speak. She declined me. I sent another messaging in greater detail explaining why I wanted to speak and that I hold nothing against her any longer, that I'm just looking for closure and I think she could be helpful.

Once again Angie declined to speak to me. She told me she had managed to move on and she wasn't interested in rehashing the past. I told her talking to me was the least she could do to help me move on since she was partially the cause of my childhood trauma.

Angie blocked me. As a last-ditch effort I went to her house (she's in the phone book, her address is public). Angie wouldn't answer the door and threatened to call the cops if I didn't leave her alone.

I don't understand why she won't talk to me. I'm just asking her for a little help, a little clarity. She was instrumental in the downfall of my parents marriage and the catalyst for an incredibly bad divorce. I feel like she owes me a little, just a little.

AITA for trying to talk to Angie?

During the pregnancy I tried to be as supportive to Anne as I could, as I knew it was rough on her, but I’ll admit it was hard for me to hold my tongue at how much junk food she was eating. Of course if she'd had HG or issues like that, she'd to eat whatever she could keep down, but she didn't, and even her mom and doctor were pressing her to eat more fruits and vegetables. I expressed my opinion once, and when it wasn’t well received, I dropped it, but my point here is that Anne has been making a sub-par effort (in my mind) for our daughter’s nutrition from the get-go.

After the birth, Anne started breastfeeding, but stopped quickly as she found it “agonizing”. The doctor and lactation specialist confirmed there was no physical issue with her or the baby, and no reason for it to be painful at all. She and Anne’s mom explained that it’s normal for it to feel uncomfortable at first, but she needed to keep at it and would get used to the feeling. She gave it a few more attempts and gave up, because it was “excruciating” and she said it was keeping her from bonding with the baby. Again, I wanted to support Anne as much as I could, and explained that a problem bonding with the baby was PPD and something we could get her treatment for, but that it was important she keep at it. In the hospital, we had the support of the lactation specialists and my mother in law, but once we were at home with the baby, Anne refused to keep with the breastfeeding and made the decision to switch our daughter to formula.

I know that this isn’t a hill worth dying on, so I said nothing, but honestly it does really bother me that she put her own temporary comfort above our daughter’s long-term health. Breastfeeding is shown to decrease the risk of a whole host of issues, and now that our daughter has her first cold, it’s hard for me not to feel resentful to Anne for putting her in this situation. While this cold may not have been avoided through breastfeeding, it’s a proven fact that breastfed children have stronger immune systems, so eventually there will be an illness that my daughter comes down with because her mother wasn’t committed enough to breastfeed. If Anne had had some sort of medical problem that made it difficult for her, I would completely understand and support using formula. But she doesn’t, she just didn’t feel like it, and it’s hard for me to read that as anything other than selfishness. I would walk through fire for our daughter, and I’m perplexed that Anne’s parental instinct didn’t come through in this instance. 

Anne has clearly sensed the resentment on my part and brought this up directly. I was honest with her that I’m frustrated and disappointed with her decision, but that since it’s of course her body it’s not my place to say any more. She said nothing and has refused to speak to me for three days, other than to discuss necessary aspects of our daughter’s care.

15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/julvdb/aita_for_selling_my_daughters_ipad/,AITA for selling my daughter’s iPad?,"In March 2018, my daughter, 16, bought an iPad. She bought it from her own Christmas money. She is a wonderful artist, but I believe she is limiting her potential.

She has made money from it, as a little over a month ago she was requested work on Instagram. She has a substantial amount of followers on it, 10k, and has made just under £100. It’s nice that she’s doing this- but it is making me worry. She does well in school, but all she is doing at the minute is drawing.

I understand, she has a hobby and people are paying her money. It is good, but I don’t like what she draws either. It is not explicit in any sense, but I don’t believe she is pushing herself. She has so much talent. And because she is drawing so much recently, she is neglecting her duties such as doing homework. 

I’ve tried getting it across to her that school is important. I came out with good grades and now I am an accountant. I worked hard at school, by doing my homework the first day I got it. I went to many extra curriculars and I was a star student. If I could do it 30 years ago, she can do it now. 

I have a rule of no technology until after dinner, but recently I’ve found out she’s been using her iPad before dinner. I took her iPad away from her and told her she knew the rules. Before dinner is for homework only, but she complained because we have dinner at 7:00-7:30pm and she goes to bed at 9:30, which doesn’t give her enough time for her to make art for her customers since she also has to shower. 

It seems that everything has been revolving around her iPad and I’ve had enough. On Friday, I had overtime at work. I left the key for her and told her to do her chores. I come home to see that she hadn’t done her work, and she came to me with a happy face. She had just been commissioned again and she was receiving £50 for it. I flipped. 

We had the biggest argument we’ve ever had. My daughter accused me of not supporting her. Which I do, but her education comes first and I’m sick and tired of her games. She cannot make a living from her art, and this social media thing is poisoning her. She knows the rules in my house, and she must stick to it. 

She retaliated that now she’s making money, I won’t need to nag at her like what I do. She finally has a good job- and she’s making more money from this than what she did on her paper round. She can put this money towards her college fund. I took her iPad and flat out told her “I am selling it.” She is to delete her Instagram, and refund that new customer. 

She’s been crying and wailing, accusing me of not loving her and twisting my words. She’s told the story to her Auntie and I now have her berating me too. Nobody seems to understand that my daughter is obsessed with this iPad. Her excuse is that she’s making money, and I tell her there is no use making money now if you can’t make it in the future. AITA?

Edit: I have not yet sold the iPad. It is with me, however I had put it up Ebay this morning, before I posted on here. Some of you are seriously making me reconsider, but my decision still stands. I want what is best for my daughter, so that in ten years she can afford to draw all day, and comfortably lounge at home and make money.",2020-11-15 13:28:50,2733,2456,0.8,333,0,0,0,1,,,1,,,1,3,2,,2,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jzssg3/aita_for_charging_my_late_dads_partner_full/,AITA for charging my late dads partner full market rent?,"My dad passed away a couple months ago and were sorting his estate out. I’m his only surviving child and was the sole inheritor. He was married to my mom a while ago but got divorced 20 years ago and had been with his new partner over 10 years. He never got remarried due to how bad he got screwed over in the divorce. That being said, he seemed to love her. 

His house is fully paid off and in a great area. He completed a bunch of renovations in the last year so I really lucked out with a totally modern, very nice paid off place that needs no work.

My wife doesn’t want to move into the new place because she doesn’t want to change our kids school, so we decided we’d rent the place out for passive income or security. 

We assumed his partner would want to move out but The issue is that his partner was not in the will so she didn’t get anything, since they’re not married. She is retired living on a small fixed income, which was fine while she was living with my dad and he paid for everything. She doesn’t feel ready to leave the place so we said if she wants to stay she can rent from us. We offered her the market rate for rent -maybe a little less and she freaked out. Said charging her at all, but especially the market rate, was cruel after the work she put into the house, I guess she planned the renovations (dad paid). 

My wife says by not doing whatever to maximize our income and put ourselves in the best position we’d be doing a disservice to our kids. I’m split morally  but going with my wife for our marriage’s sake. Does this make me the asshole to charge her full market rent?

Edit: my wife’s offer is to let her stay through December (3 months free) and then wants her out or paying rent. Not a year of reduce rent because her son has offered to take her in. 

-wife wants to reserve  rental profits to the kids college fund, something we’ve struggled to build thus far. 

-dads partner has an adult son and living brother, Son has offered to take her in. 

Final edit: no common-law or squatters rights here. they didn’t live there all 10 years, just the last 3, and she would NOT be homeless. She has an adult son she could live with

LAST UPDATE
This blew up overnight like I wasn’t expecting. She is in her 60s and seemingly healthy. We dont have a relationship. Her behavior was always somewhere between shy and antisocial (No way she would live with random roommates). My wife always thought she was rude because of this, and never really embraced our kids like her grandkids. Part of why she doesn’t feel the need to treat her like family when she has her own (son and brother). 

For everyone acting like we’re rich, I don’t know where in the post you got that. Our combined income is about 80k for a family of 4, considered lower end of middle class in our city. Market rate according to my friend who is a leading agent would be anywhere from 2.5k-3k a month. We offered her 2400 to be nice. This timelines works out that if we were to start collecting rent by this March, we’d have enough for each kid to go to college by the time they graduate high school. Then we could either keep it as a rents or sell it for our retirements. It would be life changing. 

The will was updated a total of 4 times by a very esteemed lawyer, most recently after the birth of my last son. It explicitly states that all of his possessions be left to me to provide for his grandkids. Every lawyer who has looked at it has said it is ironclad. There is no common law claim to be had. Knowing my dad, I think this was intentional to not amend the will to add her. He had expressed interest in helping pay for my kids college and He’d make dark jokes in the past about how if he’s learned anything it’s spoil your kids, not your woman. 

About 65% are saying YTA. I’m accepting the judgement that were assholes to the majority, but the NTAs made better points IMO. Appreciate everyone’s perspective but I don’t think a lot of commenters realize how expensive college is in the US.",2020-11-23 23:04:09,1299,2725,0.92,107,6,47,3,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This just happened yesterday, but I’ve (21 F) been seeing my boyfriend (28 M) for about a month and a half. 

He works at a pizza shop and left me in his apartment yesterday while he was working. Before the end of his shift, he messaged me asking what type of pizza I wanted him to get me.
 
I didn’t really have a preference, I’m not a picky eater, so I told him bring us back anything. He brought home pepperoni.

I’m jewish and I eat kosher. I’ve told him this before, and he’s seen me ordering at places asking for no bacon or making sure there’s no pork in the food. 

When I asked him why he would do that, he told me I said anything and that was what he wanted to eat tonight. He told me to order something else, or to pick off the pork. When I told him that’s not how being kosher works, he blew up at me and told me I was being picky and a dick.

edit: 
I’m seeing my bf tn and i’m going to apologize. you’re all right, the relationship is new and i might have picked a fight over something i should have reminded him over.

but to the people commenting and invalidating my level of kosher, please stop. there’s different sects of judaism, and different levels of kosher. ultra orthodox jews can’t eat at restaurants without a rabbi there, while some just follow basic guidelines. all types are valid, just bc i don’t have a rabbi blessing my food doesn’t make my kosher “faux”",2020-11-27 23:09:27,884,2584,0.91,224,3,9,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He's certainly in the camp of ""vaccines cause autism"" and ""chemtrails."" Many of us have talked to him about those things over the years but he just refuses to change his mind, so we've more or less accepted that he's always going to think this way and mostly try to avoid any triggers that will lead to a discussion of those types of things. 

My wife, who is a science teacher, has always disagreed with our approach. Not going to get into her views as to why but we've more or less agreed to disagree. It's essentially a kind of neutrality agreement. 

My dad kind of upset this balance recently when he sent our kids some shirts that promote some of his anti-science conspiracy theories. That made it hard to ignore him and his views. I tried to acknowledge the gift and thank him for it, but that wasn't enough. He wanted pictures of our kids in them. I tried to promise without promising with the hope that he'd forget it, but he didn't and kept asking for them, which started turning into him questioning my views and if me and my wife had started believing the ""lies.""

At that point the path or least resistance seemed to be to just take the photos and leave it at that. We'll see him for Thanksgiving in a couple of weeks so doing this now will make that day more pleasant for us all. Not just me but my mom, wife and siblings. 

My wife had seen the shirts and said under no circumstances would she allow pictures of our kids to be taken in them even though I told her this would be the best way to avoid any issues. I finally decided to take the photos and send them to my dad. That would have been fine if he didn't post them on Facebook for our whole family to see...

When my wife saw them she was angry. Really, really angry. By far the angriest I've ever seen her to the point where it was a little scary. She said that I was an asshole for doing this without discussing it with her knowing her feelings. I can see her point, but by doing this I am making life more pleasant for all of us. I also don't really need her permission since they are my kids too. She may not like it but ultimately she doesn't hold a monopoly on what the kids wear.

My girlfriend came back in and looked around again, and must’ve missed it on the counter. I pointed it out and she said “what I swore I looked in here already”.

I started rubbing her back and confessed to hiding the baby food. She got up immediately and left our son there in the high chair.

My dad married Alex's mum when I was 14 and Alex had just turned 13. We're civil to each other and even joke around sometimes but we'd both rather hang about with our own friend groups.

Here's the thing, Alex has always been EXTREMELY flamboyant. Like to the point where it was a surprise to no one when he came out as he was such a walking gay stereotype. I have no issues with him or his boyfriend but the way he acts and talks, and sometimes even the way he dresses, is really annoying. I can say it's not a phase as he's been that way since I met him but it doesn't make it any less frustrating. I even thought he was genderqueeer or something for a while. He used to have pretty long hair, which he's ditched for the minute, and is not opposed to wearing crop tops. It's embarrassing. I actually cringe for him sometimes, he was mistaken for a girl so many times when he had long hair and it never bothered him. Whereas I'd be kinda humiliated if someone thought I was a girl.

So, the last time I had friends over, pre covid, they thought it was pretty amusing when we walked in on Alex dancing around the living room, in a crop top, with our little sister Jess (she's 6). They were blaring lady gaga or beyonce or some crap and my friends thought it was absolutely hilarious. They teased me about it for ages, they still bring it up now. I was very self conscious about having friends over after that.

A friend of mine recently had a fall out with his parents and has been essentially kicked out. My dad and his wife said that he can stay here if need be as we have a sofa bed but I was really hesitant. I know for a fact that my friend will take the absolute piss after staying here for a couple weeks and he'll tell all of my other friends about my weird step brother. Alex asked me several times why I was so hesitant and made out like I didn't want to help my friend. He seemed to be talking down to me like a child so I snapped at him. I told him that he makes me a laughing stock amongst my friends. They humiliate me for having anything to do with him.

He was a bit taken aback by me snapping at him and left the room, I later found out he'd been crying. My dad gave me an awful lecture about ""how I treat Alex"" but I think I was just stressed out and the words just came out. I wish I hadn't said them and I would take them back in a heartbeat if I could but I can't. Plus, I think Alex was a bit overdramatic after the fact. AITA here?

(edit)

Right I get it, you all think I'm a complete AH. But I want to clear things up now.

I. Am. Not. A. Homophobe. 

I have no issue with Alex being gay. I have no issues with his boyfriend. Hell I've walked in on them before (when they thought everyone was out) and just apologised and left the room. I know Alex would do the same if it were me and my girlfriend. That does not bother me in the slightest. 

What does bother me is coming home to one of Alex and Jess' little dance parties in the living room. Having to see them dancing around and singing Bad Romance or whatever. It is great that he;s bonding with Jess, he's always been good with her but it's just cringe worthy to watch. And my friends notice that it's cringe worthy. They thought it was hilarious when our new maths teacher mistook Alex for a girl in the middle of class. Alex just made it worse by making a joke about how he was my sister. My friends think it's brilliant, I think it's humiliating. 

I'm not a homophobic person. I just want Alex to stop trying to humiliate me in front of my friends. 

Also to the people saying things like ""get new friends"" and ""Alex is your brother"". No. He is my step brother. He and I did not grow up together, we moved into the same house a few years ago because my dad married his mum. My friends and I have been friends since primary school. They are like brothers to me. I do care about Alex and will apologise for snapping at him and making him cry but I am not going to lose friends over him.",2020-11-27 00:54:27,1002,1620,0.84,391,0,1,1,,1,,,1,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everything was good as usual, but we had a server neither of us had seen before with a somewhat striking appearance: she was completely bald. Normally I wouldn’t say anything about something like that because I’m afraid of being rude, but toward the end of the dinner the server made a joke about she and I having the same haircut (I’m bald). 

I said something along the lines of, “I don’t mean to be rude, but I’m curious. Are you bald by choice?” It turns out she was, which was a great relief to me since I didn’t want to pry into it if she was sick or involuntary bald for some reason. She was more than happy to talk about it and told me all about how she’d always loved bald heads and wanted to try it. She said she got positive feedback and just kept her head shaved. I told her I loved that and I thought women could look very beautiful bald even though it’s not something you see often. I told her she had a great head shape for it and joked about offering razor recommendations. It was light conversation and that was the end of it.

For the rest of the meal my wife was silent. I could tell something was wrong. When we got to the car, there was a moment of pause between us and I asked if something was wrong. She replied, “Are we going to stop at Walgreens and pick up some clippers?” I asked her what she meant and she said obviously since I was enthralled with our server’s shaved head she had to do something to win her husbands attention back. I was “blatantly” flirting with our server, apparently. It spiraled into a huge fight with my wife accusing me of wanting to experiment with an exotic-looking woman because I was tired of my boring old wife.

I can’t deny that in the moment, I probably looked like I was flirting with our server. It was not intentional, but I guess I realize how it could’ve seemed inappropriate at my wife’s birthday dinner. I did find her attractive, but my wife will always come first. I’m attracted to her and I love her. That’s why I married her. Even now she makes little references like “I guess I’m not as interesting as a bald goddess” or “Does this look good on me or do I need to show some scalp?”

So am I the asshole for this? I just want things to be okay. I’ve tried apologizing but nothing will stop it.

EDIT: I’m starting to see people making comments that seem to indicate it is never okay to talk about balding in public. I reject this completely. I did not bring this up out of nowhere; the topic came up when the server pointed out (in a jovial fashion) that she and I had the same haircut. It was a brief conversation with zero negative or uncomfortable vibes, and when we left I said bye to the server and she pointed at her head and gave me a little thumbs up. I get the feeling we would’ve got along well as friends. So this isn’t the issue.

EDIT 2: Good grief you guys, let me clear something up. My wife is 25 and I am 24. The server looked older than both of us, probably early 30s. So anything saying in flirting with a younger woman is wrong. Also my wife suggested I don’t find her attractive anymore which is completely wrong. Why would I marry someone I didn’t think was capital H O T?? She’s plenty attractive.

I’m reading everything you’re sending and it’s split down the middle as far as I can tell. All I can tell you is please read carefully. No one was trapped in a conversation with me they didn’t want. As I said the server got my attention as we were leaving. Do you get the attention of people you’re glad are almost out the door? Also I don’t remember the conversation down to the last detail but it was maybe a minute tops. Hope this gives things a little more clarity.

EDIT 3: Lmao yall I see my post got tagged. I don’t know if that means they counted or what but I guess what I’ll do is apologize to my wife in a more formal way and see if she’ll tell me why she’s been bringing this up over and over. She doesn’t even seem mad anymore really, it’s just coming up every time she talks to me it seems like. And I never addressed it but I already apologized sincerely right after this happened last year. And again numerous times. I don’t know how I can do it any better.

Also yall are ridiculous! I got two messages saying I should get divorced by her immediately and one person said it was evidence of some kind of crime and I should be in jail! Yall I can’t with that one, but thanks to everyone who gave me reasonable input. I guess when this many people see a post I’m gonna get a few unhinged people. I will make a update if I ever get to a solution if this sub is okay with that.",2020-11-24 15:24:59,848,2680,0.93,115,10,82,5,,,,,,,3,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She finished her masters in June and had gotten a job in her field, but that offer got cancelled because of covid in March so she had to move back home. She then got another job in the summer but lost it after 2 months because the company (a start-up) went bankrupt. So she's been working full-time at the grocery store and moping around my house being all depressed in the spare time. She keeps talking about how ""screwed"" her generation is, how it's the worst year of her life and how the world is ""on fire"" and it's getting exhausting. This month is even worse because her boyfriend broke up with her. She didn't tell me why, but I'm assuming its because he's also tired of her complaining all the time. To be clear, I am a supportive dad, I paid for her masters, but I do not appreciate negative energy in my house and want to live in a positive and optimistic environment, so we've had some clashes. 

By contrast, my younger daughter (14F) is a positive and optimistic kid who's been making the best of the bad situation. She looks for positives in everything and doesn't mind the hybrid in person/online schooling. Its no secret then that I prefer to spend time with her instead of my older daughter. 

For the past week, my older daughter has been suggesting we watch the movie Contagion for family movie night. She's been asking every day but my wife and I have been busy. Last night, we finally decided to watch but my younger daughter said the movie doesn't look 'interesting' to her and she won't watch it with us. She wanted to watch 12 Monkeys instead. I told my older daughter that we should watch 12 Monkeys then so everyone can watch together, but she got offended and said she won't watch it with us. I said that's fine by me, I'd rather spend time with her sister anyways because she's not a sad draining mop. Maybe kinda mean, but after 8 months of the hell of having her in my house it just spilled over. 

She was crying for the rest of the night in her room and my wife still won't speak to me for 'alienating' her. Again, I am supportive, I paid for her schooling and I keep telling her she just needs to chin up and accept the situation and look for the positives. I just prefer to spend my time with the kid who doesn't drain my energy like a vampire.

We have everything planned out including who’s coming which has been very controversial. My sister Leah used to date Brads older brother Mike. She broke up with him because Mike cheated on her. Mike became a bit of a stalker and did things and she got a restraining order against him. I was angry at Mike, BUT when I went to university his brother was in my class and we fell in love.

Anyways when we were discussing who should come my fiancé said he wanted his brother. Brad said it’s because he’s very close with Mike and also Mike saved his life. Brad wants Mike to be there to see him progress even further in life. Brad teared up a bit (he isn’t an emotional guy) and said he’s sorry but he’s choosing Mike over Leah.

I’m very close with Leah, but Brad is my future husband so he kind of takes priority. I told Leah the bad news (thinking she would understand because she’s still going dress shopping with me) and she said I was no longer welcome in her home or to see my niece.

I don't have enough money to give them all $50K for a wedding. So I told them that I can give them $3K each and help with any DIY projects. 

When my son got married three years ago, his wife was such a sweetheart and invited me to go dress shopping with her family. I was happy to go and enjoyed the time. My daughter-in-law found her dream dress and then we looked at veils. She was going back and forth between two veils that were both over budget. I had one that I preferred so I offered to pay for it as a gift if she chose it. My daughter-in-law was happy to get the $400 cathedral veil for free and I was happy to give it to her. My son's mother-in-law thanked me for my generosity and I said it was my pleasure. This was a great way for me to have some input on the wedding in a way that benefits everyone.

Two years ago was my older daughter's wedding. I gave her & her husband $3K and spent an afternoon working on invitations with her. When we all went dress shopping (both daughters, myself, my mom) my daughter was indecisive but I really loved one specific dress. It was $2300 and gorgeous/timeless. I told my daughter that I would pay for half the dress if she chose it. My daughter was very tempted but she went with a different dress. She asked ""So mom, let's go splitsies?"" and I said no. 

The 50/50 offer was for one specific dress that she did not chose, she got upset and said I was trying to manipulate her. Except I hadn't pressured her at all, I made my offer only once! I accepted that she wanted another dress which is completely understandable. But the offer was specifically for this one dress. My daughter was upset and claimed that it was unfair and if I have the money I should give it to her. The whole thing was embarrassing coming from a nearly 30 year old adult woman who was about to be a married woman. It was a sensitive topic for a while but everything blew over before the wedding.

And now my youngest child is engaged for a late 2021 wedding. We went dress shopping just a few days ago. She asked all of us there to pick out a dress for her to try. I fell in LOVE with a dress that was a bit more princess-y than my daughter originally had in mind but I made the same offer as I did to my older daughter: I'll pay for half of THIS dress. After trying on a whole bunch of dresses, my youngest daughter asked us all what we thought and I reiterated my original offer: I'll pay for half of THAT dress. The prospect of a 1/2 off dress was good enough for her to take it. So she bought the dress that I had picked out for her & I paid for half of it. 

My older daughter was VERY upset. She said it's unfair and that is manipulative. Except I didn't bring it up constantly to either of them, I just made a simple offer and gave them the option to take it up. But now we're in a situation where both sisters are upset with each other and my daughter is upset with me.",2020-11-22 05:16:42,956,2817,0.87,357,0,3,0,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When my wife died, I ended up relying heavily on my oldest, who was 16 and I’ll call Nancy. She gave up the most, I’ll admit that, because I needed someone to watch the younger boys while I worked. She could no longer be part of her soccer team, or her art program, I needed her home. During her senior year she told me going to prom was very important to her and to please figure something out so she could go. I said I would, but ended up forgetting about it and worked late. I got home to find her crying in her dress. I was tired and didn’t want to get into it, and told her I was sorry, but it wasn’t like she missed anything important. Nancy didn’t talk to me for days after that. When her college letters started coming in, I didn’t think much of it and assumed she’d pick a college close to hone. Well, she ended up getting a partial scholarship to a school several hours away.

I was pretty upset because I still needed help, but she said she gave up two years of doing anything for herself to take care of her brothers and she wasn’t a replacement mom, and I used her. I said she was being dramatic and she couldn’t abandon her family, what were we supposed to do? She said I should be a parent and figure it out. There was a big fight but she left anyhow, I don’t have much contact with her now.

My oldest son is a senior this year, and he was FaceTiming Nancy saying there wouldn’t be a prom and how he understood but he was disappointed because he really wanted to take his girlfriend. Nancy said she understood because she didn’t get to go to her senior prom either. He said he was sorry, but she said it wasn’t his fault he was just a kid, and that I didn’t come home when I was supposed to so she missed it. I came in and said it was pretty pathetic she was still hung up on that, and she snapped back it was far more pathetic to be so inept as a parent I couldn’t handle giving her one night that I knew was important to her. She then said goodbye to her brother and signed off. My son said I’m an asshole and that it was no surprise Nancy wanted nothing to do with me. I got angry and grounded him, but he just laughed. I don’t think it was at all appropriate for her to tell him that, but my son maintains I’m the only asshole here.

It’s just not my personality. When I’m faced with a problem, my immediate instinct is ‘how do I solve this’. As in I’m completely focused on remedying the issue. I just don’t feel too many negative emotions when I’m faced with problems. I get a bad grade on a test? I’ll convince the teacher to let me retake. My parents yell at me? I’ll get them back on my good side. You get the idea. And so, I can’t remember the last time I’ve cried when faced with a a problem.

Anyhow, yesterday I got dumped and told my friends about it. Honestly, it’s no biggie. I’m mostly sure I can win her back, and even if I don’t, it’s not a big deal. I’ll move on, plenty of fish in the sea. Don’t get me wrong, I like her, otherwise I wouldn’t be trying to get her back, but she’s not unique.

Anyhow, I was hanging out with some people today, and they were just checking up on me. I assured them I was fine. They asked what I was going to do, and I told them since I had the ACT soon, I would go joke, do some practice problems, get a workout in, and then maybe start coming up with a plan to get her back.

One of them, let’s call him Jack, said that it was okay to sit down and grieve and be sad. I told him I don’t really feel grief, I just want to be productive and fix the issue if I can. I explained that I don’t really cry, and he didn’t seem to believe me and kept trying to hound me about it.

So I got annoyed and told him, ‘look, maybe you sit around crying all day whenever something doesn’t go your way, but that’s not me. I just go and fix the problem, and if I can’t, so be it.’

This pissed him off because he was ‘just trying to help’. I don’t like he wouldn’t back off after repeatedly being told to.

In fact, I had a chance to address her this morning, and I called her Dr. Smith the way she had respectfully asked me to twice. I can see that I wasn't being respectful and yes, a bit of a petulant child. I will say that it was interesting that most of the NTA's were also PhDs people who worked with them. I had a similar experience so now I can see where my confusion was in the cultural aspect of it. Thanks people of Reddit for weighing in and for (mostly) keeping it civil.

I have a son in 2nd grade who is in a public school in the US that is in fully remote. During the first week of school, I listened in on class. My son’s teacher, whom had signed the only email we had from her as Dr. Sarah Smith\*, told the kids, “My name is Dr. Sarah Smith, but you don’t need to call me “Dr.” because I know that can be confusing because I’m not a medical doctor, so you can just call me Sarah, Ms. Sarah or Ms. Smith (our school’s norm is calling teachers and staff by their first name).” I filed this info away for my own self, and went on with my day.

A few days later, all the teachers met with families to get to know each other. My son’s teacher came into the call and introduced herself as Dr. Sarah Smith. She was quite the talker and spent a lot of time talking about her background and credentials, but seemed pleasant and excited about her job. Near the end, I asked, “Ms. Sarah, can we still access the school library?” and she said, “Actually, it’s Dr. Smith. ...”

I was taken aback because I had recalled her telling my son’s class they could call her Ms. Sarah. I couldn’t figure out how to respond and felt rushed, so I quickly apologized for getting her name wrong and we signed off.

Meanwhile, as I’ve been helping my son with his work, I’ve been noticing how she signs her messages to students with “Ms. Sarah” and “Dr. Sarah Smith” with the parents. In the classes, the students were calling her both Sarah and Ms. Sarah. I was confused.

Fast forward to this week when we had our second parent/teacher meeting. Once again, my son’s teacher jumped headlong into our meeting without much greeting and spent most of the time talking. When I finally had the chance to speak, I once again addressed her as “Ms. Sarah” and she once again corrected me saying “actually, it’s Dr. Smith.” So I said, “I’m glad this came up because I’ve overheard you say to the students they can call you Ms. Sarah and my son refers to you as that at home so that’s where my confusion is coming from.” She replied, “With parents, I prefer to be called Dr. Smith.” And then she steamrolled on until it was time to go.

Now I feel certain she’s just power tripping here. I don’t want to feed her ego, nor continue creating confusion in our house when my kid talks about his teacher Ms. Sarah and I’m talking to him about Dr. Smith. Yes, I’m an asshole for thinking “Is the ‘Dr.’ really warranted here? We are just dealing with teaching a bunch of 8 year olds how to capitalize proper nouns and what division is” but I get there was likely more to her degree than that, and I can put that all aside when it comes to being respectful and honoring people’s wishes. However, all of this had made me feel like just referring to her generally from here on out.

So folks, am I missing out on some cultural norm here? Am I the asshole here for not wanting to call her Dr. Smith and feeling like she’s being egotistical?",2020-11-07 01:20:59,1841,4796,0.89,120,3,23,1,,,,,,,,2,,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been a very brutal journey for me and my husband. We have experienced many disappointments. 

My sister is also happily married and they adopted 2 teenagers (who are also siblings). I have stopped going to my sister for any emotional support as her advise has always been ""Just adopt"". I know that she thinks that the fact that I want to spend so much money on fertility treatments instead of adopting is stupid. In the past few years, I haven't spoken to my sister because my life revolved around the treatments and I didn't have any time for her negativity. 

This whole experience changed a lot of things in my life. Everything is sometimes heart breaking and I get irrationally emotional. I am pro choice and I know that in my brain but when someone mentions that they had abortion, I immediately see red. I usually remove myself from the situation and I feel very bad/guilty for even thinking some awful things about women. 

Recently we had a family dinner for our parents anniversary and she seemed a little off. My mom kept asking her what happened. At first, she wouldn't tell what happened. After dinner, me, mom and my sister were sitting in the living room while the guys and the kids were outside. My sister was grimacing and my mom again asked her what happened. She confided that she recently had an ""Oopsie"" and had to about. She said that she already had two kids and she doesn't want more. 

I froze. I had always assumed that my sister was also facing problems which is why she adopted. It felt like a punch to the gut to find out that wasn't the case. Worse, my mother was gushing and telling my sister how proud she was of her and that she was so brave. 

Something broke in me. I yelled. I screamed. I said some awful things. I said that her family wasn't real and she was an idiot for having an abortion. I told her that the fact that she would have an abortion for them was stupid. I told her that she wasn't even a woman because she couldn't appreciate the joys of pregnancy. I told her that she was going to regret doing this when they turn 18 and forget all about her. 

I stormed out after that and after having another breakdown in my own house, I felt guilty and ashamed. 

I called my sister and mother next day and told them I was sorry. Both of them were incredibly pissed at me, especially because the kids overheard me telling that they weren't her real kids.

My sister became very angry and bitter towards them both which I can understand 


But here’s the issue me and Kate have been best friends since we were 5 obviously I told Kate off about the affair and stopped taking to her but in July we made up and I saw how happy they were so I invited them to the wedding (me and my ex brother in law were close). 

I thought they’d put the differences aside for me for a single day because even tho my sister won’t admit it she has to be civil to them in the long run for her daughters sake 


Well Friday when Kate and my sister showed up for a fitting all hell broke lose. My sister called Kate a “nitty  prostitute” and asked me what kinda game I was playing, Kate was crying/apologising but sis just told to fuck off than left 


Since than my sister told me she and her daughter aren’t going to my wedding, most of my family have joined her calling me a bridezilla and an asshole even my in laws are mad 


So give it to me straight AITA for just wanting a perfect day were everyone puts their differences aside for me

Yes Kate knew my sister was gonna be there she wanted to talk to her and maybe try to mend things 


No my ex BIL didn’t know he chewed both of us out because my sis is 8 months pregnant and has already been making it difficult to see his daughter

She had previously lived with her mother but I got default custody after her mother turned one of her 24 hour disappearing acts into a never coming back one.

My daughter and stepson go to the same middle school and were both running for student council VP. 

There was tension in the house and my wife told my stepson that if he won we could go out to celebrate. My daughter asked if this applied to her as well since he wasn’t her only competitor and my wife said of course.

The campaign got pretty stressful for the both of them. Then the votes come in and my daughter wins by 4 votes.

However, because somehow the one person who ran for treasurer this year dropped out because of grades, my stepson was offered that position. 

He saw it as a really pitiful consolation prize and was angry that he had to take orders from my daughter.

I felt very bad for my stepson and he and his mother (who is also very Type A), was very upset, even though of course my wife congratulated my daughter.

My stepson refused to be comforted by the fact that older kids get more easily elected because they know more people and his mother even offered to take her to her law office and give him some responsibilities, saying that was better experience than student council would ever be. 

My stepson then said “ please tell me you’re not going to rub it in my face by taking us to dinner now.”

My wife also looks really reluctant to go to dinner. 

I finally tell my daughter that we weren’t going to be going to dinner because her stepbrother was very upset by the turn of events and we need to take his feelings into consideration. And that I was impolite to gloat.

That all happened Friday. My daughter ended up crying and even now, Sunday night, she still is mad at all of us.

Evelyn is 9, and she’s been testing boundaries lately. My husband and I do not spank, we do time outs, take away privileges, and talk things through.

Whenever she has made these sorts of comments, we have had serious discussions with her about how inappropriate and hurtful they are, and we urge her to think before she speaks next time.

Tonight I got home from work early and decided to cook dinner and let my husband sleep in (he works nights and usually cooks dinner due to our schedules). I made beef stew from scratch. Nothing fancy, but we all enjoy it. I seasoned it as I always do, with salt, pepper, thyme, and a bay leaf. I felt good about cooking for my family, and didn’t even take the time to change out of my work scrubs  before I began. My husband woke up to the smell of stew cooking, and he was so happy about the surprise. Evelyn even said it smelled good. 

Then we began to eat. It was good, tasted just like always. My husband complimented it. Then Evelyn chimed in. “No offense Mom, but this stew is really bitter. Maybe next time only use half a bay leaf.” I stared at her for a good 10 seconds, my jaw on the floor. I had just worked a 12 hour shift at the hospital and come home to cook her dinner from scratch, only to have her insult my cooking. I honestly wasn’t sure how to react. I was hurt and angry, but I don’t like to raise my voice, and just talking to her about these statements in the past hasn’t changed her behavior. 

The thing is, if the stew really was bitter, I would have laughed about it, and told her that bay leaves don’t make things bitter, and maybe gone through possible ingredients that could have made it turn out that way. But the stew wasn’t bitter. My husband agrees, it tasted completely normal. I checked, and the bay leaf wasn’t in her bowl, it was still in the pot on the stove. She was just trying to come up with some way to insult me. So when I was finally able to respond, I quietly said, “If you don’t like the stew, you don’t have to eat it. Please take your bowl to the kitchen and get in the bath. You may eat breakfast in the morning.” 

Now she’s sobbing in her room about how unfair I am, and my husband thinks maybe I went too far. I was hoping that maybe the discomfort of going hungry for one night will remind her to watch her words in the future. What if she had said this to my elderly mother instead of me? What if she had said something cruel to one of her peers and destroyed their friendship? I don’t know how else to get through to her that words can cut deeper than any hunger pangs. Taking away the meal she insulted seemed like a fitting way to help her understand, but did I go too far? AITA?

Edit: thank you to everyone who has taken the time to respond and give me your perspective. Many people thought that I did the right thing, but most agree that I did not. I didn’t have enough characters available to explain in my original post that she did not “starve,” she has a stash of applesauce and granola bars in her room (she has a little tent and likes to pretend she is camping) but I see now that I should not have used food as a punishment. I will ask for her forgiveness when I get home today and try to have a talk with her about why she said what she did and how we can move forward together.

***Update: I had a long talk with Evelyn when I got home tonight. I told her I shouldn’t have sent her to bed without dinner, and I apologized and asked for her forgiveness. I asked her why she made her comment, if she really did taste something bitter in the stew? She started crying and said the stew wasn’t bitter. She said she wasn’t even sure what bitter tasted like (lol). I asked why she said it was bitter then?  She said she saw the bay leaf in the pot when she served herself, and she thought it would be funny to tell me it made the stew taste bad. She apologized for making it up. I asked if she wanted me to feel bad, and she said she didn’t know. After a very long and loving, gentle conversation, I think the real root of the problem is that she’s having trouble adjusting to my long hours while I’m working double shifts and finishing up school. I think she was trying to get my attention, one way or another. Moving forward I told her I’m going to try to give her the positive attention she needs before she feels like she has to resort to getting negative attention. And we agreed we will try to give each other grace through the process. Our relationship is intact, and hopefully will grow stronger as she watches me learn from my mistakes. 

I appreciate all of your comments, even the ones that weren’t so kind. I tried to keep my heart and my mind open to see how I could learn and grow, but now that I have resolved the issue with my daughter, I won’t be responding any further on this post.  Thank you all for your time and opinions.",2020-11-17 03:27:04,1011,2609,0.9,222,3,6,0,1,,,,,,1,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jokf37/aita_for_telling_my_youngest_daughter_that_i/,AITA for telling my youngest daughter that I cannot give her away at her wedding?,"Long backstory: I have 2 daughters, Anna (elder)and Carly (younger) who are a year apart. 

Carly and Anna were close when they were younger but drifted apart in their teenage years. I think she started resenting Carly because Carly always seemed to do well, academically and socially. 

Anna decided to take loans and go to a college she wasn't really a fan of. Carly got a full ride to Anna's dream college. Anna became very resentful after that. She was sure that Carly chose that college to rub it in Anna's face. 

I tried my best to accommodate them both. Anna refused to talk to Carly and didn't consent to any form of therapy. Carly refused to compromise as Anna kept being unreasonable. In the end, they both stopped talking to each other. Neither of them has ever asked me to choose between them. As long as I don't bring up the other or try to get them to reconcile, I have a good relationship with both of them. 

Now: Anna is a single mom with a 3 year old kid (Alex) who is always in between jobs and in debt. Me and my now-wife help out when we can, she recieves a bit of child support but I have to admit that she is struggling. Carly on the other hand, lives comfortably, has an incredible job and is living with her long term boyfriend. 

Recently Carly announced that her boyfriend proposes and that she wants to plan a wedding in 2022. She asked me to walk her down the isle and I may have cried a bit. 

However, Anna found out and then she came over to my house and had a breakdown (?) about how she always thought she would be the first to get married in the family and she has always wanted me to give her away first. I tried to console her but she ended up getting angry and told me that I should refuse to give away Carly or have a father/daughter dance with her at the wedding. At first, I refused but she then threatened to cut off all contact between her/Alex and us. [If Alex wasn't in the picture, I would have cut Anna off. As things stand, I need to consider Alex's well being].

Carly is staunchly childfree and it is very possible that Alex is going to be my only grandchild. Without my help, Alex's life is just going to be much more harder and I cannot abandon Alex with a good conscience. 

While I understood that Carly would be upset, Alex was a child and he is priority. 

I spoke to Carly, explained the situation. I told her that there was still time and I would figure out a way get Anna to change her mind. If not, I still promised her that I would still be very involved with her wedding except those 2 things. Carly just laughed and told me not to bother with her anymore and told me she wasn't going to invite me to her wedding. 

I definitely know that Anna is an asshole putting me in this position. But AITA for expecting Carly to be more understanding?",2020-11-05 15:12:42,1378,6546,0.93,286,0,3,8,,1,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was sure she'd gotten me something really good. Possibly a PS5, but I know there's a shortage. So I wasn't gonna get carried away.

So I wake up Sunday morning and walk downstairs and she hands me this envelope. I open it and it's a b&w sonogram. Don't get me wrong I'm happy that we're having a baby. Delighted. But this was **my day**, you know. No card, no cake. Just a print off. 

Like, if it wasn't my birthday she would have gotten a scan anyway. I told her I thought she was cheap and while I know I'm not entitled to a PS5, I do expect something decent!

She’s been living at her parents house since she graduated from college at 21 despite having more than enough money to move out or move in with me as a software engineer. Her reasoning was she wanted to save up and invest all her money(and I mean literally all her money, she doesn’t have to pay for rent, groceries, utilities, anything) to buy this million dollar house next to the lake. 

Well who would’ve thought if you dumped 150k into the stock market every year it isn’t that hard to end up with well over a million dollars in a couple years. She bought the house without having to take out any loans and I finally thought we could move in together. Then she lets me know that I need to pay the $700 monthly hoa fee if I want to stay with her. She doesn’t even think it’s fair to split it since she put all her money into the house and I wouldn’t even be able to afford a house like this without her doing so. That she’s already paid more than “her fair share” and I should pick up the rest. She also said I already pay more than this for the apartment I share with roommate so it’s not like I can’t afford it. My girlfriend makes significantly more than me and my name isn’t even on the house so I don’t think it’s fair to make me pay anything, AITA?

Edit: To clarify, she wants us to split property taxes and utilities 50/50 but wants me to pay the full hoa fee monthly.",2020-11-18 12:47:07,1013,1656,0.92,105,6,17,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jv812w/aita_for_saying_im_a_better_dad_this_time_around/,AITA for saying I’m a better dad this time around? My daughter took it the wrong way.,"I was 28 and my ex wife was 27 when we had our daughter (26). Our son was born 3 years later. 

We were both young and saddled with financial problems. I was working 80+ hour weeks to climb the ladder and to at least make my expensive degree worth it.

My ex wife and I fought all the time because I felt pressured to marry after she got pregnant and I felt she could have worked more. 

Therefore, growing up my two older kids did have to experience me coming home at 10pm, missing award ceremonies, and cancelling vacation plans. 
I also find it crazy how I berated my kids for academic performance in a way I could never imagine doing so now. 

I fought with my ex wife about money and would sometimes return clothes she bought for the kids when I saw they came from department stores rather than stores with Target level affordability because I didn’t get why kids needed that. I also  took arguments into screaming matches and left in a very bad way. 

I admit I have a strained relationship that I’m now repairing with my kids. My daughter now comes over to the house I share with my new wife a couple times a month and sometimes stays over. 

My wife (28) just gave birth a year ago. I’m now in a high level position at my company so I can step out whenever and get myself days off so I like planning fun activities and surprising my wife with going shopping or date night. 

When my daughter is here, I invite her to come along if we’re doing something family stuff. Her attitude varies a lot but I let it go because she’s getting therapy and treats her one year old brother well. 

However, yesterday we all went shopping and my wife is in the process of remodeling our son’s room. My daughter kicked up an attitude when my wife wanted to go to the home section of Bloomingdale’s and pick out items. She also wanted to buy some new clothes. 

When my wife was out of earshot my daughter asked why she needed to buy kid stuff from an upscale department store and the baby wouldn’t remember the clothes ever. I had the same argument when I was younger but I learned that sometimes it doesn’t matter what I think works, and I’d rather just make my wife happy.

So I told her to stop bringing up the age old argument about upscale goods. Then I told her that I thought the same way as her in the past but I’ve learned a lot about compromise over the years. I then mentioned that I feel happy for a chance to do it right this time, and I’m a better dad this time around. And this was a new beginning, a second chance. 

She immediately teared up and said “ Congrats, guess you changed.” She wouldn’t accept my explanation that included being a better dad to her too and ended up Ubering back to her apartment.

AITA? This statement was meant to say I’ve done wrong and am doing better but she’s acting like I mortally insulted her in some way. She now refuses to respond to any form of outreach by me.",2020-11-16 14:52:58,920,3208,0.9,256,1,0,0,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was a planned pregnancy, so it wasn't unexpected, but it's still big news. I'd already been experiencing a lot of anxiety about parenthood and have for some time (even some performance anxiety because of it), but when she told me she was pregnant it kicked into overdrive. I felt like I was going to have a panic attack, but more than that I felt like I just needed to get away - away from her and the situation and to have some time to think about it. 

I ended up going to stay at my parents' cabin for a few days, and I think it helped. When I came back I felt more relaxed and not as anxious. I also had time to really think about the pregnancy and come to terms with it. 

My wife now says that I shouldn't have gone and should have stayed at home to support her. She doesn't feel like what I did was fair since she also has fears and anxieties and she thinks prioritized my mental wellbeing over hers and the baby. I think that's an extreme reaction since I only was gone a few days, kept in constant contact with her, and came back in a much better state. I can understand why my reaction was probably not what she wanted, but she did tell me that she wouldn't object if I felt like I needed a few days to process things. 

What I did doesn't seem like something that would make me the asshole. I don't really think my wife is one either unless it would be for telling me it was okay to go away and then changing her mind. So I am here asking if anything that happened makes either of us the asshole.",2020-11-08 21:22:09,1374,3713,0.9,294,2,14,0,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was not happy to see me hanging out there, silhouetted against the street lamp. Frankly he made quite an undignified fuss about it.","I'd assumed he was out because he'd not be able to sleep through the banging if I couldn't? Anyway, he saw me hanging at the window like Dracula and made such a frightful noise. You know when you're dreaming and you think you're shouting for help but you wake yourself up and the noise you are making is, ""nuraghrurARAAAGAHAH!"" It was like that. Pitiable, really. No sangfroid whatsoever. And vampires aren't even real.

Anyway, after the initial screaming I was able to explain my reason for hanging there, and he agreed that the window banging was a problem, but he blamed his landlord for not mending it! Which also, to me, showed a lack of gumption. As a renter I'd fix problems as they arose without bothering the landlord. I wouldn't just sit there in my room blubbing like Lucy Westenra as some helpful neighbour took matters into his own hands. It was an easy fix, too, I just wedged it shut with a load of blu tak. Which I never got back, actually. Also, it was quite a tricky climb. It's not a hobby I've ever gone in for. At one point I had my feet on something but my hands down near them pulling upwards to stay on the wall, which really didn't feel safe.

This happened years ago but another post on here about someone coming in to a house at night reminded me of it. I won't say it led to a rift between me and the neighbour, but there was a coldness thereafter.

Edit: Reading your judgments has been interesting! I do seem to be a less sound person than I thought, both ethically and mentally. I can accept that I am an asshole, if maybe a rakish, gentleman diamond thief kind of asshole. A loveable rogue, if you will.

Thank you all for an entertaining and enlightening evening.

She calls her stepdad “dad” because he’s been in her life since she was three and he lived with her primary parent.

At work we have a 3 hour block that we can take a 1 hour lunch break during.

I said something along the lines of “this is kimchi. It’s traditional Korean food. what would you do if we hired an actual Korean person and this is what they wanted to eat?”

First, the way she told me was what started us off on a bad note. Instead of doing a thoughtful announcement, she just gave me the positive pregnancy stick with a note telling me I was going to be a father. Didn't even get a card. I tried not to obsess over it but it felt low effort on her part and like she didn't really give a rip. 

Second, she got her cycle dates wrong and ovulated early which is what led to the pregnancy. I know some will say that I could have worn a condom or taken responsibility, but this is the type of birth control we agreed on as a couple. I put my trust in her to stay on top of things, and I can't help but feel like she let us both down. 

Third, she's been unpleasant to be around since she found out. Always in a bad mood and sassy. I can't even ask a simple question without snark. It's still early weeks, so I'm already dreading having to do this until next July when she's due. I fantasize sometimes about running away or just not coming back home and have been trying to stay away from home as much as possible to limit how much I have to see her. 

We've argued about my attitude and lack of excitement, and I made it clear to her that I feel she is 100% to blame based on three reasons. She accepted some blame but said that I need to also take responsibility for my own actions and by not doing so I am the asshole. She has tried to blame some of it on the pregnancy, but I think she's just looking for a scapegoat so she can feel better about herself and the role she's played in our current struggles. 

The only reason I believe she might not be wrong is because I've been so angry and over things that I don't completely trust my judgment.

Ever since I (F37) was 5 I have generally hated physical contact with most other people. I refused to hug or kiss my parents, didn't hold hands with family /friends etc, hate maintaining eye contact and the like. I think may parents were bothered about it as I grew up but just accepted it and it really wasn't an issue.

I have always hated the custom of hugging friends when we meet up and I detest cheek kissing. I know this is weird but it makes me physically uncomfortable, but I only have a small circle of close friends who have known me forever and its not been an issue.

I had a son when I was 27 and obviously love him thoroughly and as a baby he had plenty of cuddles etc. But since he was a toddler I haven't really had much physical contact with him. I find it uncomfortable (don't know how else to put it.. I have a revulsion?). For the most part I didn't think he was bothered, he has plenty of attention, I'm just not cuddly with him. (we have private handshakes /fist bumps etc) 

But the other week, he told me it bothered him that all the rest if our family /his stepdad cuddles him but that I don't. I tried to explain it, but I'm not sure as a 10 Yr old he could understand. I feel rotten about it but it's not just him, it's evidently how I'm wired.

But here's where I may be TA, with my partner I am always snuggled up, we are very close physically (and I always have been with sexual partners) but to me physical contact is only for one person, the one I am with, anyone other than that ant it feels wrong/awkward/horrible to me. I'm wondering whether I shouldn't show so much physical affection in front of my son. 

My mum thinks I am TA for this, I should either hug my son as much as my partner or keep physical contact with my partner strictly private. And that I should just ""get over it"" and put up with feeling uncomfortable hugging my son because my feelings do t count when it comes to that kind of situation.

Edit: I do not starve my son of physical contact. He often lies with his legs over me, I tickle him, we have secret handshakes, I hug him. I also explain my feelings to him and we discuss his feelings. I just don't feel comfortable cuddled up face to face with him.",2020-11-13 13:56:12,1110,1862,0.89,234,21,10,0,,,,,,,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now I'm not the type that calls every other hour whenever she's away or anything, I give her her space and I respect her privacy. I never really try to even ask how her day at work was because she likes to keep work/personal life separate. Understandably so. But things have changed. I noticed three was this guy who has been a patient under her care who always gets brought up. For example she'd have his number and call him outside of work, I was surprised when I heard her talking about hi, to a close female friend of hers. And when I asked she told me ""patient confidentiality"" so I shouldn't ask who this guy is. I basically knew nothing about him other than he receives treatment under her care. That's it. I tried to let it go and thought nothing of it. But I couldn't ignore her interest in this particular patient after she started contacting him during late times at night for long periods I just confronted her and she lashed out saying I was trying to get involved in her job and trying to control her.

And I did my best to not make her feel I had anything to do with it but she came home and yelled at me telling me that I was behind the issue she had at work and that the hospital officials have spoken with her and got the patient involved as well after they received a complaint against her, she somehow knew and yelled at me for wanting to ruin her career by being petty. She refused to sit down and talk. Packed her things and left. She told me to not try to contact her because she wanted to rethink being with someone who has no regard for her hard work. I tried to explain to her but she keeps lashing out at me.

I felt absolutely terrible but her reaction wasn't fair to me at least. She didn't even think how her behavior was affecting me and kept calling me petty .

Info: I was able to determine exactly which patient she was talking to her friend about by talking to her friend. Otherwise I wouldn't have felt strongly that something was going on. Her friend told me that my fiancee mentions this patient a lot and talks about him in details. She'd get so defensive whenever I try to have a conversation with her about this issue and make sure I get 0 answers. Also whenever she's on the phone with him she'd walk out and stay gone for a long time. Then stays quiet afterwards. Honestly at this point it's pretty obvious and I feel so bad that she's behaving like this now after 6 years. I've never seen her act like this ever. I have an awful feeling and I just can't take it.",2020-11-26 19:47:10,543,1255,0.92,77,0,56,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I saw a video from CBC news where they venues for several hundred people costed over 1000 dollars more if it was for a wedding than an anniversary or some other gathering, which is ridiculous becuase it isn't costlier for the venue to host a wedding as opposed to any other gathering with the same amount of people.

I tested this out and my friends called the venue asking about hosting other events and a wedding and it would be an additional 1700 dollars for us to host a wedding than ""other"" so we did other.

We pulled the same shit with the caterers and for the decorations. The caterers found out and seemed to not care, neither did hte people supplying the decorations but the venue was fucking pissed. We paid for everything up front and they sent us an invoice for 2000 dollars saying we owe them more for lying to them and that weddings cost more.  I told them to piss off and hung up when they called me. They kept calling and emailing and i just ignored them.

I got sick of their calls so on the 5th time in a day they called me I said ""listen you cocksucking pieces of shit, ive told you many times to stop fucking calling me or you'll fucking regret it, we paid the fees we don't owe you anything else so piss off!"" and I hung up.

My wife is saying im too rude and i have other family members who are saying we scammed them and we owe them. I told them to shut up, I've got more important shit to do then deal with these assholes

last year we moved to a completely new state. we started new jobs and got the ball rolling but one thing I've noticed is I never could make long term friendships. I got a long with my coworkers but never hung out with them.

then I met Amelia who was super great and willing to hang out with me. we had a lot of good times to where I could finally call her my friend.

she knows I love my husband and will put him first all the time.

there have been times I cancelled on Amelia because my husband and I wanted to have a sudden date night or such. she's been pretty cool about it. she just say we'll reschedule.

I don't know why but today was different. 2 weeks ago we decided to pick a date to go to a haunted attraction, which ended up being tonight. I saved up some money for it. then yesterday my husband announced he had the day off and said lets have a whole day as a date. I said we could use the money I had saved up for the attraction and just reschedule with amelia. 

I told her this morning and instead of her okay cool message, she told me she was hating being second choice and she was really excited for this night. I told her my husband will always come first, he'll always come before her or any friend. she told me i obviously don't need a friend then because I don't have any time open for others. my husband feels guilty but I'm trying to prove he shouldn't be.

On the weekends, we would stay up late at night and watch whatever random B rated horror movies we could find on Netflix. But now I can't even look at her.

Recently, she asked her father for permission to get a nose ring (I don't know what in the Heaven's name he was thinking to actually say yes!) I've been adamant about nose rings. We don't do them. If you want to get them when you're 18 and on your own fine, but not while you're under my roof.

The point is, I was completely blindsided. She came home, like, ""Mom, guess what?"" and showed me this (septum?) ring and I nearly fainted. 

It's not even one of those cute little button ones that maybe I could have tolerated. It looks like one of those rings you put in the nose of a bull! 

I was furious and I asked her, ""Why? Why would you do that to your beautiful nose? And without my permission? And what kind of stupid ring *is* that?? If anything, why not a cute, little nose stud?""

And then I went crazy on my husband for letting her get it, and he said that she was going to get it anyway so he just wanted to be there to make sure that she was okay. And I said, ""Without my permission though?"" and he was quiet but he later apologized.

That was on Friday. Things have been pretty tense since then. I've calmed down considerably, but everytime I think of how they went behind my back like that, I get riled up again. Throughout the day, I find myself just peeking at her nose ring. 

Today, I was going through Netflix looking for a movie to watch and my daughter came over and quietly sat beside me. I found a B movie and I put it on, and we were watching it silently for a moment, but then I could see her nose ring in the TV reflection and I stood up and said, ""I'm sorry, I can't. I'm not going to watch this movie with that ridiculous nose ring showing in the reflection"" and I walked off to watch TV in my bedroom.

I fell asleep, but my 14 and 15 year old daughters woke me up and told me they could hear their sister crying. Her door was locked and she screamed at me to leave her alone. So I said, ""Oh, don't worry, I will. But see the way you feel right now? That's how I felt when you didn't listen to me and went behind my back.""

Obviously, I still love my daughter, but I don't like what she did. Or the way she just went behind my back and did what she wanted like what I said as her mother didn't even matter. (And she still hasn't apologized either).",2020-11-18 01:50:21,965,1347,0.81,334,0,0,0,,,,,,,,2,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I thanked her for telling me, I told her it was going to be okay, I reassured her that I still loved her. But inside, I was scared for her. Scared for what other people what think, scared for how she would be treated, and scared above all else for her relationship with God. But God told us it isn't our place to judge, so I just focused on smiling, showing my love, and praying for her.

But I also cried. A lot. Not in front of her, but a lot. And it got so bad that I knew I needed help. I needed to talk to people that could relate and understand, but I didn't want to talk to anyone that we knew personally, so I went online and found a support group for a Christian parents with LGBT kids. We do Zoom calls, and just seeing other parents going through what I'm going through was such a relief and it's really been keeping me going for these past few weeks.

Usually, I attend these calls with my face camera off, but today, I finally felt comfortable enough to turn my face camera on and tell my story. I wound up breaking down and crying, but it was so therapeutic.

Unfortunately, my daughter heard me and came in the room and found out what was happening and said, ""Wow. So me being gay was such a burden to you, you had to join a support group?""

I honestly didn't know what to say. I was feeling so many emotions at once that my brain just shut down and I tried to like turn it around on her by getting angry and saying, ""Really? Were you listening by the door? Couldn't you knock first?"" 

She just said, ""Unbelievable. Don't worry, I know what you think of me now,"" and walked out.

I don't know what to do. I tried my best. I don't think it's fair that I shouldn't be allowed to join a support group, or that me joining would be any reflection on her. This is a *me* problem that *I've* been dealing with by myself. But now I feel ashamed for doing that, and I don't think I should feel that way.

51,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jtm3gu/aita_for_telling_my_brother_that_his_wife_ruined/,AITA for telling my brother that his wife ruined her own (and his) life?,"Today I went with my brother (I'll call him Sam) to visit his wife (I'll call her Amanda) in prison. Why she's in there is a long story. 

Basically, Sam and Amanda are very different people. He's quite a simple man. He's got an OK job (welder) which he enjoys and isn't particarly ambitious. He enjoys just having fun with his family (they have a four year old daughter, Lexi). He's practically a giant child himself and loves just running around and being silly and making Lexi laugh. He's a hopeless romantic who doesn't care what kind of life he lives so long as it's with Amanda and Lexi. 

Amanda is the total opposite. She's a very ambitious and competitive person. She works at a senior/executive role at a big company and loves it. She loves the finer things in life. She's got a huge collection of gorgeous clothes, shoes, bags etc and always dresses beautifully. 

Opposites attract in their case, but it's good because they've always brought out the best and stopped the worst in each other. She stops him from treating everything as fun and games and reminds him to have some ambitions like fitness etc. He stops her from getting too ambitious and competitive and gives her a lot of support with work stress. 

I won't say exactly what Amanda did to get sent to prison. All I will say is that she did go too far in her attempt to reach a goal, and crossed a boundary into something illegal. 

As Amanda was by far the higher earner, they've lost quite a big chunk of income since her employment was terminated. They've still got more than enough money saved up and Sam is on a decent salary. The prison she's in is a 3 hour drive from where they live, but he tries to take Lexi to see Amanda as much as possible. 

When I saw her in prison I barely recognised her. She's a shell of the person I knew. Obviously her career is destroyed and she has no idea what to do when she gets out. This is the first time I've seen her since she got locked up and she was crying her eyes out. Sam was crying with her and hugging her and promising his ""sweetheart"" that all would be well. 

Obviously I held her hands and told her it would all be OK, but when we left and were in the car home, I told Sam I didn't feel sorry for his wife at all. She chose to screw people over to get what she wanted. She had a great job, a husband who adored her and a beautiful child. But that wasn't enough for her. She still wanted more and committed crimes to get it, and that has ruined their lives. 

Sam was enraged. He dropped me home and told me that he doesn't want to hear from me at all unless I apologise. My husband thinks I should, because he's still hurting and misses her. 

I don't think what I said was wrong. Sam needs to accept his wife's own role in where she's ended up.",2020-11-13 19:12:17,557,5557,0.94,311,0,5,0,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trying to keep this as relevant and short as possible, found out that she's not my biological child. Broke up with lady but, though it wasn't the same, I still kept contact with Kasey and tried being there but not that actively. Months ago she asked whether or not I'd still be coming to her 13th birthday given everything and I said yes and we discussed taking her for the weekend after. Well that was before her darling of a mother came after me for cs which is something I drastically underestimated and didn't would happen but the law proved to be quite a bitch. Trying to sort that out but it's not looking promising. Anyways that's neither here nor there. The point is that I've actually become pretty demotivated to continue with the relationship we had before because mum's always going be there and I'd prefer to cut that off as much as I can which sucks because Kasey's a great kid. There's just more bad then good. As soon as I got the reminder for her birthday I called her and told her that I was sorry but couldn't come anymore go her birthday nett Friday nor do that weekend thing and wished her early. She obviously wasn't merry but it didn't sound like she was going to break down.

Essentially, my wife is tired of me never defending her. I guess she hit a breaking point recently. Her SIL (my brothers wife) doesn’t like her at all. My wife has been nothing but kind to her, but my SIL was her high school bully and I guess just never grew out of it. My SIL is constantly insulting my wife to me, telling me that she is a w****, among other sexist insults. Honestly I always just ignore it. My wife hates it. She doesn’t understand why I can’t just tell her to stop. She sees it as me going along or “laughing off” what my SIL is saying. Frankly I just don’t want involved. There has been multiple times where this has happened with different people, my boss making sexual comments about her, etc. but I always ignore it because I really don’t want to start some sort of conflict, she knows this. But I guess she’s finally at her breaking point with it and she wants me to start doing something. I dont know what she expects from me. What am I supposed to do? Start fighting people for her honor or something? AITA for not defending her? Or is she just being over dramatic?
Editing because she told me to add this. She asked that I at least tell her when SIL messaged me insulting her and that I never do. I don’t see why she even wants to know that though? Also I blocked SIL and I figured that would solve our problems but for some reason she’s still mad at me. She said that it felt like I was avoiding the problem instead of dealing with it. What does she want me to do now? Unblock her and send a strongly worded text?

Edit again. My wife has informed me that she’s staying with her parents while she thinks through things. She also told me I should’ve married my SIL because “clearly” I care more about SIL than I do her, which I feel is hurtful and ridiculous.",2020-11-21 20:44:06,681,888,0.86,309,0,1,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jp4exw/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_my_wife_with_our/,AITA for not wanting to help my wife with our child after they have gone to bed?,"So..long story short, my wife and I share the responsibility of parenting equally all throughout the day. After we have put our child to bed, thats my signal that I can play video games and my wife be okay with it, which she is. 

The issue lies in the fact that the games which I like to play are online and thus when I'm in the middle of one, there is no pausing the game. 

Now, when our child wakes up at night, she berates me for not stopping what I'm doing immediately and helping her. I have absolutely 0 qualms with helping her...after I finish the game I'm in. It doesn't seem fair to me to let my teammates down when I'm not going to be much help to my wife regardless. I always immediately say I will help you as soon as this game as over...queue meltdown from my wife. 

So...am I the asshole?

Edit: For clarity, I work in an incredibly stressful occupation most days of the week while my wife stays home with the children. Once I come home, I still help with our child until they go to sleep. Then I retreat to play videogames..they're what keep my sane.

Edit2: My wife gets her free time during the day on the weekends to do as she pleases and is why she's okay with me playing games at night. Also, my child IS NOT  an infant. When it's my turn to watch our child individually, never have a had to call my wife and request her come home to assist me. I know what requires the aid of 2 parents. If my child genuinely needed both of us while I was playing, I would not hesitate to help.

Edit3: My wife is not trying to sleep when these events occur. This is also her pseudo free time that she gets on top of the time she gets when I have a day off or she just needs a break during the day.

Edit4: I mentioned in a comment our child drinking juice at night and it has been highly controversial. Our child normally drinks milk at night and yes we do occasionally give heavily watered down juice. Our child brushes before bed and in the morning and the dentist has had no issues with it so we roll with it.

Edit5: I'm getting some serious hate so I'm going to attempt to clarify as best I can. I take over all parenting responsibilities when I get home from work so my wife can do as she pleases. My wife is also free to do as she pleases during my days off. We share tasks when she chooses not to do anything with her free time. We also share tasks at night when we are both in bed. This arrangement is agreed upon by both of us. My issue is not getting the same uninterrupted personal time that she gets. Hope this clears things up. Also, I don't appreciate the personal attacks and assumptions in my DMs.

Edit6: There seems to be a massive assumption that when I take over watching our after getting off of work that I'm not helping with household chores etc. This is completely false. I wouldn't say my wife is free to do with her time as she pleases if this weren't the case. My wife and I work very hard to keep the house spotless. We try and share the responsibility of cleaning as closely as possible but were both aware thats not entirely possible when she is home more than me.

Edit7: I'm starting to regret making my first post in this sub. People here seem so quick to make an assumption rather than ask a clarifying question. I have tried to lay out the facts as best I can. I appreciate those of you who gave constructive criticism and those of you who asked clarifying questions. I doubt I will be entertaining the individuals who make vast assumptions or threaten me for much longer. I was down voted for making genuine points and trying to explain myself.

Edit8: Our child is far from an infant. Our child is 3 years old and its not like I'm letting our child wail and scream. If you're a parent you know what sounds mean what based on the child.

Edit9: I have received a lot of advice that I should sot down with my wife and discuss my feelings with her. We have had this discussion in the past. Her issue is that I am busy with video games and not something that she sees as something worthy of being busy for. She has explicitly told me that she wouldn't mind if I was busy with something other than video games.

Last edit: I came here looking for genuine advice. I suffer from pretty severe anxiety and depression. I certainly was not anticipating coming here and having people tell me I should kill myself, that I shouldn't have had kids, etc. I dont know what to think right now. 

I appreciate everyone that had kind words. I will do my best to respond when I get the opportunity.",2020-11-06 12:42:26,1111,2980,0.87,200,13,43,7,,,,,1,,1,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I said this to a group of friends in what was supposed to be a private conversation just between us. On top of that I was venting some frustrations. None of that is abnormal; everyone does it even if they pretend like they don't. Same with letters people write and don't send. People are allowed to vent, and if we judged everyone by their venting, we'd all be assholes, I think. 

The fact is that she's been hard to be around and demanding since she got pregnant and wants to be pampered all the time. I don't mind a lot of it since it's what I signed up for, but I'm working full time and have a lot on my plate. In addition to taking care of her, I'm helping to take care of my sick grandmother. That makes it hard to not only do everything I was doing but most of what she did before she got pregnant. 

Some of it makes sense like things involving a lot of heavy lifting or things with chemicals, but simple thing like running to UPS, doing a load of laundry or getting groceries I think she should still be able to do since she isn't that far along (four months). I know that having twins makes a difference but still from what I read it seems like she's doing less than is normal, which makes me feel like she isn't helping as much as she could.

Some how word of what I said got back to her, and it was not good. I tried to explain to her that it was mostly venting and that it wasn't fair to take me to task over this because it was meant to be a private conversation, but she said that was BS. We then had an argument about whether my comments were inappropriate. I refused to take them back because I feel there is a lot of truth to them, but she thinks I am being too hard on her and have no empathy for what she's experiencing. So now this has turned into a fight over whether I'm the asshole for telling the truth instead of biting my tongue to make her feel better. 

If what I said is true, am I still the asshole for saying it instead of protecting her feelings? She also says I am the asshole for talking about my friends to her behind her back, but I was venting. In that context I don't see how I was really bad mouthing her. Am I also the asshole for expressing my frustrations to my friends openly?",2020-11-19 03:31:07,756,908,0.9,165,7,18,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was all in good fun and never meant in a mean-spirited way. They were really excited for me when my wife and I announced that we were going to be parents, so they and my two closest friends went in together and got me a trophy to commemorate the announcement. It's a large penis with an engraving that says ""This F trophy is awarded to \[my name\] in commemoration of a successful impregnation of \[wife's name\] in A.D. 2020. Mission accomplished.   

I think it's hilarious and clever on their part, but my wife doesn't like it and wants me to give it back or throw it away. I've told her that she's being too sensitive and knows that my brothers and friends are just congratulating me in their own way. It doesn't have anything to do with her, but she feels it's disrespectful and gross and that by keeping it and siding with them I am treating her not like a wife and partner but like a baby maker only. She says that it makes her feel devalued and like maybe I don't feel we are equal partners in this. 

I honestly think that it's a bizarre way to look at this and strange to read that much into a gag gift (no pun intended). It's not meant to be a commentary on anything. It's meant to be crude and funny!

I keep it in my office and away from anywhere that we might have guests, so I don't see the harm in keeping it. It's not like I'm flaunting it or she has to look at it. I can't believe that she's so bothered just by it being somewhere in the house to the point that she's upset and thinks I'm TA for keeping it. 

I don't like fighting about this during what should be a happy time for us, but I think she's overreacting and don't see how any of this is about our relationship or how I feel about her.

She came home for her friend's birthday on Friday. This is the first time I (47F) had seen her since the semester started. She hasn't called much since the beginning of the semester which made me a little nervous. She's always been a chubbier girl, but I noticed she had lost a lot of weight in a short time span. I asked her if she was doing ok and she said yes. She seemed pretty upset when I asked about the weight loss. I am worried about her, but she says she's doing ok. I'm proud of her for losing the weight though. I had to work that weekend, but I got to see her in the evenings.

My dad is not in the picture. I was going through tinder the other day to obviously try and get laid. I set my age setting pretty  high to try and cast a bigger net if you get what I am saying. And well I see my mother(and obviously I don’t swipe right you sickos) And I hate to say this but my mom came across as a typical tinder ho. Saying not to swipe right if you aren’t 6’0+ and very muscular, having pictures showing of her butt(ew ew ew ew), and saying shit like she is down to eat a guys ass(ew x infinity). Obviously seeing all this shit horrified me and completely killed my desire to get laid. 

I later tell my mom what I saw. She’s surprised because we aren’t even in the same age range and makes a joke about me going after milfs. I tell her to stop joking around because this is serious. I ask my mom if she can at least make her profile a bit more classy and she immediately says no. Says that tinder is a fun hookup app so that’s what she is gonna do, have fun. And says I wouldn’t even have this problem if”You weren’t trying to fuck somebody’s mom.” I leave her with me saying”I just hope you know I’m disappointed in how you are handling this situation.” She tells me there is no situation and that was the end of that.

Last week was our anniversary and I decided I wanted to propose. Since we met via Skyrim, I thought I would promise with the amulet of Mara, which is the symbol that someone is ready for marriage. She doesn’t really wear jewelry or anything and has never shown me a ring she likes when we’ve talked about marriage so I thought it’d be sweet to have something that brought us together. 

I set up this whole picnic with our favorite things and when I proposed, she looked sad and asked about a ring. I told her I thought the amulet of Mara was sweet because we met via Skyrim. 

The other day she sat me down and said she thought the amulet was very sweet and she liked it, but she wanted to go ring shopping. I told her I had already bought the necklace and I didn’t see any reason for a ring since I didn’t propose with one. She said she appreciated the sweet gesture but she really wanted a traditional ring.

It is not a large company, but I get paid 6 figures and the CEO is a good friend of mine. I have been in the company for 2 years, and it is time for me to get a new phone and laptop. We get the newest tech each time we need to upgrade, but we don’t get the top-of-the-line tech, (e.g. iPhone 12 instead of 12 pro, and MacBook Pro 13’ over MacBook Pro 15’). My daughter (15) asked if she could have my phone and laptop when I retired them in spring, and so I said yes. I didn’t ask the CEO because I know he would say yes, as he is like a godfather/uncle to her, and she was even there for the birth of his child. I mean, all of the other tech will go to me to be given to interns and sold on eBay, so why not?

My daughter is friends with the daughter of the head of sales, someone who I hired just after I joined, so he is also ready to give up his laptop and phone. She, excited, told her friend that she was getting a new laptop, and I assume that the daughter went home and asked her dad if she could do the same, because later that night I got an email from the head of sales for my country. He pretty much said he wanted to give his daughter his laptop and asked if it was ok, to which I said of course not. It is company property, and is still worth around 700 dollars. He got a little fed up and asked why my daughter could have my laptop, but his daughter couldn’t? 

This is of course a stupid question, and IMO is like a teacher expecting the same privileges as a super-intendant, and it is frankly entitled to talk to your boss like that, not to mention the deep personal relationship we have with the CEO. My Fiancée said that our daughter shouldn’t get higher privileges than his, and I should just let him have it, but I just don’t think it is right to. 
So, AITA?

Edit: I am the COO

Edit 2: we pay all of the executives the same, including the CEO, myself and the sales director in question because we want a balanced wage for the top of the company. This is still a new company and it lets us hire the best staff. 

Edit 3: I did not treat him like crap, I didn’t say anything to him, except ‘no’. also, for all of those privately messaging me and telling me that you hope the company fails, you might not have realised it but in doing so you are also wishing that the sales director and around 200 others will also lose their jobs.

Small wedding, tight budget. She knows that I pride myself on my baking skills and asked if I’d consider baking her cake. Of course I said yes and that I’d do it as a wedding gift to them, free of charge.

There’s this video I found scrolling on Facebook where a guy who was bringing the cake to the sweetheart table tripped and fell, all over the cake. I thought it was hilarious so I asked my brother if he’d mind getting messy. He thought it was hilarious too and agreed.

So I prepared two identical cakes - one as a joke, for the trip/fall/smash and the other to say, “Haha! Gotcha!” K has a great sense of humor and her husband A does as well so I thought things would be fine.

Wedding goes great, reception going great, time to bring out my cake. My brother was carefully walking the cake to the sweetheart table when he “suddenly tripped”, landing on the cake on the floor. Everyone froze for a few seconds, but K burst into tears. My brother started immediately saying apologies, the floor was slippery, it’s just a cake, etc. K would not calm down.

People stood up to console K and survey the damage, helping my brother up as well. When he stood, he turned to look at me and I nodded and we met in the kitchen. Bro changed into his backup clothes and grabbed the other perfect cake.

I walked into the room and whistled so I could get everyone’s attention. Then my brother walked out of the kitchen and we both yelled, “GOTCHA!” And successfully delivered the perfect cake in front of K and A. We explained it was a joke, the cake wasn’t ruined after all, but K didn’t find it funny and yelled at me for ruining her wedding.

It was just a joke. We cleaned up the messy cake and had the other cake ready to go. K lost nothing, except maybe her sense of humor. I don’t know. But now her family is mad at me and K refuses to talk to me.

My partber and I just had our engagement photos taken (safely, with precautions). The photographer was recommended to us by a friend whose photos impressed us so we contacted the photographer, paid their deposit, and hired them for the day, which was day before yesterday.

My partner and I chose a location that meant a great deal to us, is easy to access but somewhat remote, as to avoid other people in our shots or outside influence in our photos. My partner and I arrived on time at the location ready to shoot. There was nothing we needed to do to get ready.

The photographer was half an hour late before they called us to let us know they were late and they were a further hour late. When the photographer arrived they had their young child as well. They didn't tell us they'd be bringing a child with them when we booked nor did they tell us when they called us to say they'd be late. They explained that their childcare fell through and they couldn't find a replacement but we were their only appointment for the day so it wasn't an issue (on their end).

It took nearly half an hour for the photographer to set up their equipment. Mind you at this point we had been supposed to begin an hour before and, figuring we'd not be finished anytime soon, my partner had to cancel our plans for after the shoot, upsetting many people and causing disappointment. Their attitude was also incredibly brusque and abrupt. They were also kind of pushy and bossy.

When the photographer finally started shooting their child began acting out and they had to stop every few minutes to parent the child. It sort of ruined the afternoon for us because when the photographer wasn't paying attention my partner and I were trying to keep the child from getting hurt.

The photographer took an hour's worth of photos and we all departed. On the way home I told my partner I wasn't paying for any of it because the photographer was stopping every few moments to watch the child, the child causes massive disruptions, and how the photographer was late and had a negative attitude.

This morning the photographer emailed us the photos they'd taken and despite everything the photos were actually really good. That said, I told the photographer that we wouldn't be using the photos or paying her because of everything I listed above.

The photographer started blowing up my phone with nasty texts. When they threatened a law suit I blocked them. My partner deleted the photos that had been emailed to us because we didn't want them.

Our friend who recommended the photographer to us said she was surprised because the photographer had been great for her and her fiancé. She said we suck because we let the photographer do all the work for nothing. I mean, we did pay a deposit (nonrefundable).

Are we asshole for refusing to pay?

ETA: I'm reading all the comments and I hear everyone. I would like to add that my contract with this person said I would receive 300 photos, which I did not. That being said I am going to contact the photographer and offer to pay for the 100 photos delivered.

She said that my positions make no sense, and that ""its specs outweigh the price premium."" I pointed out that the model she wants has only 8GB of RAM...meanwhile, my $600 PC has 64GB.

As a child, she collected these stuffed animals and kept them on a shelf in pristine condition with the tags on. She never played with them or used them and rarely even touched them. But she would get really angry if anyone else ever tried to play with them. 

Now that she's older, it's been several years since she's handled them. She's no longer living here, but works out of state after graduating college. Her collection is still in her room at my home. 

A few weeks ago, I was babysitting my niece overnight. She's 4. She stayed in my daughter's bedroom and asked if she could sleep with a few of the stuffed animals. I figured my daughter likely won't be back anytime soon and probably doesn't care anymore, so I removed the tags of a couple animals (choking hazard) and let her sleep with them. She did get a little drool on them, which I wiped the next day. 

A few days later, I zoomed with my daughter and let her know my niece used a few of her toys. She seemed upset but didn't say anything until I mentioned I took the tags off three of them. Then she completely exploded, telling me that was vandalism and I was out of line for removing tags of toys that didn't belong to me (even though she kept them in my house). I told her she an adult and doesn't need toys anymore. And she told me it was disrespectful of me to damage her possessions that I knew were really valuable to her. 

Then she also told me that her collection, unadulterated, would have been worth thousands, which I didn't know.

My daughter Lara (15) wants to be a doctor like me. She does have the talent, her grades are excellent and her teachers are very happy with her. However, I think her personality is a very bad match for the profession.

Lara is a very sensitive person. Throughout her childhood she cried constantly. Even the slightest thing could set her off. She's still a frequent crier as a teenager. A high stress environment like medicine would not be good for her. 

Lara is also deeply empathetic. She's quite similar to my husband in that regard. Obviously, careers like medicine, nursing etc need some level of this, but she tends to connect very deeply very easily (like proclaiming someone she's known for a day is her best friend and breaking down sobbing when that inevitably turns out not to be the case). 

On a minor note, it's not just the nature of the work Lara will struggle with. I've been a female medical student. Those girls are snotty and catty. She would be scrutinised not only for her skills, but also what she wears and how she acts. The sort of girls I studied with would make her life a living hell. 

I tried to tell Lara that maybe she should think about something other than medicine. I did try to encourage her by saying there are lots of things she could use her big brain for, but she burst out crying and ran to my husband. He and Lara have quite similar personalities, so he understands where I'm coming from. However, he thinks I shouldn't have been as blunt as I was. 

I don't see how I was blunt at all. I tried to encourage her and praise her talents. All I said was that she should maybe consider something else.

She tried taking laxatives but they didn't work. After reading some stuff on the internet, she was convinced that she needed to go to the ER. She believes that there is something seriously wrong and that she needs to get a CT scan of her stomach to check to see if she has an impaction. 

I've been with my girlfriend for three years (we're both in our mid-20s) and can definitively say that she is a bit of a hypochondriac. She tends to freak herself out by googling her symptoms, which we all know WebMD will say is cancer, and then proceeds to be scared until she can either see a doctor who will assure her there's nothing wrong or until she feels better. 

Thankfully, she's been in good health recently up until this bout of constipation. Last night, she told me she'd lost her appetite and after failing to poop multiple times, asked me to take her to the ER. Of course I've been very concerned about her health and pain that she's in, but I just didn't think it was severe enough to warrant a trip to the ER. I told her that we could call her primary care doctor the next day and see if we could schedule an appointment ASAP. She refused and continued to ask me to take her to the ER and was in tears at this point. I felt terrible but I continued to say no because 1) she doesn't have good health insurance and a trip to the ER could cost us thousands which we certainly don't have to spare 2) we live in an area that has a staggering number of Covid cases and I'm scared that we could be needlessly exposed 3) I did not think her symptoms were severe enough to warrant a trip to the ER. Since my girlfriend doesn't have a license, I was pretty much her only ride. She spent the rest of the night crying and refusing to talk to me. 

This morning, we got into an argument over the issue again which ended up in her storming out. I've texted one of my friends about this and he said I should just suck it up and take her to calm her fears and that I shouldn't be so unwilling because she's my girlfriend and I love her. Now I'm unsure...maybe I've been a dick and should just take her? AITA?

Edit: Commented this down below, but people said it's helpful so I'm adding that we did try the local urgent care but they're only doing telehealth visits, but my girlfriend wanted to be seen in person. A nurse spoke to us on the phone and asked her if she was vomiting/feverish (symptoms that would warrant an immediate ER visit) and she said no so the nurse said that she could probably hold off. However, my girlfriend did not trust the nurse's opinion since she said a nurse is not a doctor.

Edit 2: **Alright so my girlfriend came back and continued asking me to take her to the ER so I finally did since people said it could be a bowel obstruction which is really serious.** Thanks everyone for the advice. ER doctor said it wasn't severe enough to do scans. He felt around her abdomen and said it wasn't the appendix or gall bladder. He also stuck a finger up her butt and said he felt stool. He basically told us to come back if she starts vomiting or if she experiences severe abdominal pain coupled with a fever. To be very honest, I'm upset that this visit turned out to be so useless. I thought the doc would at least prescribe some meds, but he told her to get ducolex and take more miralax. 

I know that most people here think I'm the asshole and I can definitely see that, but I think I'll just take being the asshole in this situation because I'm pretty fucking pissed at how all of this turned out. I'll be paying bill since my girlfriend is currently jobless. She's honestly worn me out completely and I'll have to reevaluate this relationship.

It started off well and I definitely thought he’s physically attractive. However he has a noticeable facial scar (which I don’t mind) which I’m still getting used to. 

So we were talking and I asked him about his scar. He didn’t really answer and kept changing the topic. I’m very curious by nature so I asked again. Instead of answering my question, he asked me if it’s a dealbreaker and I told him it wasn’t. 

We went on talk about other stuff and my mind wandered a bit. I wondered what he’d look like without the scar(like I said, I’m curious). So at one point I told him that I want to cover his scar with makeup just to see what it looks like. He declined and that was the end of the conversation. Afterwards his entire attitude changed which kind of ruined the mood. 

Later that evening he sent me a goodbye text. I was pretty shocked/confused and asked him why he doesn’t want to go on another date. He said he got the impression that I’m not physically attracted to him and that he understands if I’m not interested. I was pissed and told him we wouldn’t have gone on a date in the first place if I didn’t find him good looking. And I already told him his scar wasn’t a dealbreaker. 

He didn’t reply to me until 2 days later. Now we’re still talking but he gives me 1-2 word replies and doesn’t seem enthusiastic at all. I feel like he doesn’t even care anymore. 

My friends were wondering what was going on between us and I told them the whole story. According to most of them I was a huge AH and should apologise to him immediately. One “friend” even stopped talking to me because of this.Only my closest friend defended me and said that I didn’t mean no harm. She agreed that his behaviour was really uncalled for. 

Am i really the asshole here? I mean he KNOWS that I don’t find him unattractive or anything. Am I the AH or is he just overreacting?

But I had a huge chip in my shoulder where I felt like he denied me a better life with the parent I preferred to live with.

My younger sibling has access to a lot more than I ever did by living with my mom. And most importantly, he is growing up with more of mom's love and attention. I get very jealous about it. 

I'm now 16 and I have a choice to go live with my mom. But I'm choosing to stay because I'm only a year from graduation and I'm in sports that I need to get into college.

But I got into a huge fight with my dad the other day. I basically cursed him out for being selfish and an asshole for doing what was best for him and not me. He told me he tried his best but I told him his best wasn't good enough.

I told him I'm going to college in mom's state and I doubt I'll be coming to see him much anymore.

He started crying and saying sorry and I felt bad but what's the point of apologizing now? I  asked him so many times over the years to let me live with my mom but he said no.

I haven't talked to my dad for the past week. And I don't plan to anytime soon.

They didn't break up, she died in a car accident, God rest her soul. I also attended the same high school, albeit as a student two years junior, but we only started dating after we both went to colleges that were close by each other.

From when we started dating to now, my husband has had a stuffed bear with an audio clip of his ex saying ""I love you"" in it. You know, one of those bears that you squeeze and they say the audio. Every night, he squeezes it and it supposedly helps him fall asleep. He never went to therapy to get over her death, and the fact that he still has the bear and squeezes it to help him fall asleep at least once every night leads me to believe that he still hasn't moved on from her death.

At first, when we started dating, I was okay with it. I know that everyone has different times for processing loss, and that she wasn't just his lover, but also based on what he told me, she was his best friend who was there for some hard times in his life. However, as the years went on, and he remained attached to the bear if not more so, I suggested and started pushing for therapy. He adamantly refused at the time, saying we couldn't afford it, which was true, because we were both struggling financially. Now, however, we're both financially stable and able to afford therapy. He still refuses to go. We got into a huge fight about it yesterday, and I ended up taking his bear. I told him that I won't give it back until he promises to either attend some sort of online counseling or actual therapy when this pandemic is over. My husband is extremely upset with me.

I don't want him to get rid of the bear by any means. I think that it's a lovely idea to continue to honor the memory of his best friend, but his attachment to the bear is nuts. He NEEDS to hug it every night no matter what, panics is he cant find the bear, panics if I take it for a bit to wash or clean it, etc. I want him to keep the bear, but stop being so attached to it. I communicated this to him several times over the years, but he has either brushed me off or told me that I'm disrespecting his ex.

I know at face value what I did as definitely an asshole move, but I think I have enough justification and reason behind my actions. It's going to be twenty two years next month since she died, and I just don't think his obsessive attachment for this long is healthy. Still though, my husband hasn't talked to me ever since the fight, unless it's him demanding the bear. I'm starting to feel like I did the wrong thing.

edit: I don't know how this got so twisted, but I am not jealous of the bear, or his late girlfriend. The issue isn't the bear, it's my concern for my husband's mental health. Maybe I made a poor judgement call, but it sure as hell wasn't me acting out of my own ""jealousy"".",2020-11-13 03:06:27,610,1326,0.93,94,15,58,30,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
74,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k0ret3/aita_for_not_talking_to_my_daughter_about_my/,AITA for not talking to my daughter about my granddaughter,"I (66M) have five daughters - three from my first marriage and two from my second marriage. 

My eldest daughter Erin(36F), hasn't spoken to me since her wedding four years ago. She invited my younger daughters to her wedding, however my wife and I thought it was inappropriate for them to go. My divorce from my first wife wasn't very amicable, and she ended up making a scene and crying in front of our mutual friends. She also played hardball with the divorce and got most of our marital assets, which I think was more than fair. My ex's sister also verbally assaulted me once while the divorce was ongoing and I had to hide in the bathroom to get away from her. My eldest from my second marriage is very sensitive, and I thought it was very likely that one or both of these women would create a scene which would traumatise her.

When Erin called up to confirm numbers for the wedding, I explained that my daughters wouldn't be attending, and I explained why. I figured that Erin would understand, since she's always been good about this kind of thing. For example, when my wife and I chose to only include our children in our wedding photos, Erin was the only one of my daughters who understood why. Erin had also been the daughter who contacted me the most often, so I figured we had a good relationship to fall back on. I paid for her education and wedding dress too, so she's gotten a lot from me as well.

Well, Erin was furious. She shouted at me over the phone (I was calm and polite throughout), tried to blackmail me into bringing her sisters, and also got her mother to contact me and try to convince me to change my mind. She also said that if my younger daughters couldn't come if her aunt was there, then she'd uninvite her aunt, but I told her not to do that, because I didn't want to ruin her wedding. And besides, her mother was a problem as well, so it didn't matter if her aunt was there or not, my younger daughters still couldn't come to the wedding.

I ended up going to the wedding with just my wife, and it was lovely. Erin spoke to me for about ten minutes during the reception, so I thought that she had gotten over her previous nonsense. However she hasn't tried to call me or text me since. I called a couple of times, but she didn't answer, so I stopped trying. Erin avoided me at my 3rd daughter Lara's wedding, so it seemed pretty clear that she wasn't interested in talking to me..

Erin gave birth to her first child a couple of years ago. She didn't call me to tell me about the pregnancy so I figured she didn't want me to contact her. Most of what I hear about the baby is through family/friends who have seen her. The way I see it, I'm respecting Erin's boundaries by waiting for her to make the first move, but my sister says I'm being an asshole because I hurt Erin and I should make amends if I want to see my granddaughter. I just don't see it though, because it really does seem like a huge overreaction on Erin's part, and I did think she'd see my point of view.",2020-11-25 12:36:09,322,672,0.86,124,0,4,2,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I freaked out and (wrongly) blamed her for everything, and said there was no way I wanted to be a dad. I said I would take no part in anything, wouldn’t sign the birth certificate and wouldn’t pay child support. My dad said I’d have to sign my rights away or she could take me to court for a paternity test and child support anyway. So I told her I was going to do that, and she didn’t fight me. 

Fast forward to present day. I had an accident a few years ago that has made it impossible for me to father any children. This was a hard blow to my wife, and our marriage has struggled as I’m not willing to adopt, but she wants children. She knows I fathered a kid when I was younger, so I thought I’d contact my ex about seeing them and maybe my wife would be happy in a stepmom role. My ex said no, and when I protested she basically told me tough luck.

I said they were my kid and she said actually he’s not, I signed my rights away so I had no children as far as the law and she was concerned. My kid has a “real” dad, and a life, and I’ve never been part of it and I never will be. I was so angry I started yelling about taking her to court for custody and she wished me the very best of luck in that endeavor and hung up. I was venting to my brother and he said no judge worth his weight in salt would give me custody or even regular visitation after a decade of no contact just because I suddenly found myself sterile and wanted to appease my wife. I didn’t want a kid, so I don’t have a kid. He also said I’m not treating him like an actual person and did I even once stop to consider the fact he wouldn‘t even know who I was, only that he’d been forced to go stay with someone who didn’t want him. I got upset and stopped talking to him.

I shouldn’t have threatened to go for custody and I admit that, but people are acting like I’ve done the worst thing ever by even contacting my ex so I thought I’d ask, am I really such an asshole?",2020-10-24 15:44:49,1136,5548,0.89,290,0,0,0,,1,,,1,,1,1,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jb0rkl/aita_for_being_brutally_honest_about_my/,AITA for being brutally honest about my experience having teen parents and embarassing them?,"EDIT: After reading the comments and giving it more thought, I have decided to move back into my rented room on Friday. My parents can live their lives pretending that they haven't been neglectful, shitty people. I have told my parents that it's best if we cut contact. But if anyone asks me, I won't hesitate to tell the truth about what they've done.

Apparently me embarrassing them is worse them than me being neglected as a child lol. I accept the judgement.

Original post:

I'm 23 and I'm just starting college. I had to wait to go to college because I went to extremely shitty schools growing up and I got an awful education. I ended up working and going to community college just so I could save up and apply to a proper bachelor's program.

Because of the current situation, I had to move back into my parents home. My roommates work as nurses and I wasn't feeling safe.

My parents had me when they were in high school. They tried their best but teenagers have no business raising a kid.

We struggled most of my childhood and they only ever became stable when I turned 17. I now have two younger siblings who are 5 and 2.

We had a family zoom call recently with my aunt, uncles and grandparents.

We had the normal chit chat. Then my aunt said she was so proud of my parents for stepping up and raising a successful child.

This is where I may have been an asshole. I kinda scoffed/laughed when I heard my aunt say that.

Then my aunt asked ""what's that supposed to mean.""

And I kind of just vented my entire issues of being raised by two immature teenagers who didn't know what they were doing.

That I went to shitty schools and lived in shitty neighborhoods and that I was borderline neglected. And now I'm 4 years behind other people my age.

We just ended the zoom call at that point. 

I never vocalized my issues before but I did that night. 

I told them they were not good parents to me and while I loved them, I don't really respect them.

And that frankly, I'm pretty bitter and jealous seeing my parents be better parents to my siblings than they ever were to me.

My parents were very upset and they apologized. They told me they tried their best.

I just locked myself in my room for the rest of the night and refused to talk to my parents.

The next day, I decided to move back to my rented room but my dad stopped me and was in tears as he apologized again.

Now my parents are on this weird mission to make it all up to me. Which apparently involves some sort of promise to pay my student loans.

All this feels too little and too late for me. But I am still staying in their house because I have asthma and can't afford to get sick.

I had my son just a week ago. My husband and I had been discussing names for the longest before he was born. He wanted the baby's name to be Jafari, which is a popular African name. (We are both African). 

However, I had been thinking about how unfair America can be when it comes to any POC or darker skinned people in general. A common problem that people like me seem to face is finding jobs simply because our names dont sound ""white"". I struggled with this very much growing up and I didnt want my little boy having as hard of a time.

So when it came time to sign the paper work for the baby, despite my husband's complaints, I signed his name down as Jacob. My husband was furious and said that I was being selfish. To be fair, I had pretended to agree with the name, only to change my mind last second. We argued more after the nurses left, him saying that I was being delusional and that his name wouldn't affect his ability to get jobs. 

All I could do was apologize, but I sincerely felt like I did the right thing. A week later, I feel unsure. 

AITA?

Edit: I dont need anyone telling me that my race isnt the reason I couldn't find jobs or I'm just making excuses for that. I know what I went through growing up. I just want a judgment.",2020-11-22 22:59:18,307,1159,0.92,97,12,21,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a lot of ways I've still not come to terms with it, but I am better now and have come a long way from where I was after it happened. I try to keep her memory alive with little things that remind me of her, and one of the things I've done since she passed was always keeping some of her brand of perfume around so I could   
keep that scent/her scent present. I'm sure that seems kind of creepy, but it's not uncommon among other widowers I know. 

At some point, I bought it for my current wife as a gift and asked her to wear it. I didn't tell her when I gave it to her that it was the same type my first wife wore, but my first wife's friends and family noticed and I asked them not to say anything. They didn't but told me they felt this was not healthy. I disagreed because I wasn't forcing her to wear it and it was the only thing like this I did. I never asked her to change hairstyles, hair colors, or the way she dressed, so it is not like I was trying to recreate my first wife. It wouldn't have worked even if I wanted to do that because they don't look alike, which I think proves that what I'm doing isn't unhealthy. 

We've now been married for over a decade and my former sister-in-law finally told my wife about the perfume. She thinks I need to move on and stop living so much in the past and believes that my first wife wouldn't want me hiding something like this from my wife or holding onto her in some of the ways I am. I don't get her concerns. She acts like I'm a crazy person, but this is the only thing like this I've done. Ever. I feel like she making this into a big issue when it's not. 

My wife was very upset that I never told her about the perfume being my first wife's favorite, and it has caused some other issues. For one, she now wonders if some of the times I was really attracted to her it was just the perfume and me imagining my first wife. I've tried reassuring her but she won't listen to what I say. 

She thinks I am the asshole for what I did, and my wife's family have all said as much in private over the years because of this secret. I don't think what I did was that bad. I didn't tell her but I never forced her to wear it and haven't tried to change her. She knows I love her and our family, and I always thought of this as a harmless tool to help me deal with the past. 

I don't feel like an AH, but I'm not sure that I can judge myself fairly because I've done this for so long and justified it to myself over the years as a harmless thing that helped me process my feelings. Everyone seems to think I am wrong so I don't know anymore. Maybe I was always the asshole and didn't know it.",2020-11-01 23:24:50,772,3188,0.93,349,1,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I hate to admit that I'm not particularly close to my step-sons, because they're still mourning their mom, and I find it awkward to talk to them and interact with them, especially the youngest, who is on the spectrum. I'm not sure how bad it is, but he's nonverbal and doesn't interact with anybody without my husband prompting him. My husband has tried his best with my daughter, and they've been bonding well.

I can't remember exactly what he said, but in response, I said that my daughter would always come before his sons. And an argument came to life.

On Tuesday I had a lunch meeting with a prospective client at a restaurant that sits across from the old courthouse in our town. There's been a group of protesters there for the last few months, but usually it's a small group and it's only sporadically that they're there. On this day they happened to be there. 

As background, my wife has never protested with that group and has never said anything about it. She claims that she has and has talked about it with me, but I have no memory of that. As far as I know, Tuesday was the first time she'd ever joined them. 

After we had been seated and gotten our drinks, I heard someone call out to me. I didn't recognize it as my wife, so I ignored it and kept talking to the prospective client. The person kept calling out my name, so I finally turned to see who it was and I saw my wife across the street with the protesters. It embarrassed me that she would shout at me like that in public, so I didn't respond. Then my prospective client made a comment about the protesters that wasn't nice, so I felt like it was better not to say my wife was one of them. I asked him if we should leave and go somewhere that was quieter, and he agreed. My wife called out to me again and started to cross the street, but by then we were walking away and she didn't follow. 

She was livid when I got home that night and asked me why I ignored her. I was honest and told her it was because she made a scene in public and embarrassed me in front of a potential client. She doesn't believe that justifies ignoring her, but I don't think she gave me much of a choice. 

That's basically where we are now. She thinks I was rude and disrespectful, and I think she was to blame for not telling me what she was doing or using better judgment.",2020-10-31 01:30:10,880,2677,0.93,69,3,105,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His mother and I split up when he was 7 and I moved a few hours away with my new wife. We still spoke on the phone, I payed child support and I'd visit him if I wasn't too busy (especially for his birthday and around Christmas). As he got older, Logan started to resent me a little bit as I spent more time with his half siblings than I spent with him. But this couldn't really be helped.

One of our common arguments was about how inappropriate he dresses. Logan has some serious body confidence issues and tends to disguise that by colouring his hair very bright colours, getting piercings and, most importantly, wearing (in my opinion) some pretty revealing clothes. He wears a choker/collar thing a lot which he says is just his fashion choice, he wears shorts that are a little too short (nothing extremely revealing but definitely a bit shorter than a normal man's shorts) and I have even seen photos of him on Facebook wearing some sort of belly top thing at a pride march. He also takes a lot of pride in his appearance (e.g. makeup, painting his nails etc.). I just haven't ever approved of this sort of fashion sense, however, his mum is completely fine with it and, well, he does live with her.

Around two months ago, Logan and his mum had to find somewhere else to stay due to renovations. My ex wife's sister said they could stay with her but as they only have one bedroom, my wife and I offered to let Logan stay with us for a little while. Everything was fine, Logan had even agreed to dress a little more conservatively around my kids. However, a week or two later, I had to check an email about my youngest's school and, since my phone was dead and my wife had the laptop, I decided to just quickly check my email on Logan's laptop whilst he was out shopping.

I was shocked with what I found. Logan was logged into messenger and was sending disgusting, sexual messages to another man. There were no pictures but the messages really grossed me out. I questioned Logan about them when he got back and this just started an argument about privacy. I tried to argue that this wasn't the point, he had been sending disgusting  messages to another man. I found out through Logan that his mum knew about this. He had (before covid) been going out on a bunch of dates and whoring himself out to whatever man called him pretty. My ex wife had made sure that he took condoms with him, went through some safety procedures and just allowed him to act like a tramp. I was disgusted and told him as much.

His face just fell and he walked out of the room. He went to his aunts house with his mum and has been ignoring me since. I've had a few angry conversations with my wife where she has accused me of making my son think I'm ashamed of him. I'm ashamed of his behaviour, not him.

My wife has also argued that I may have been a bit harsh but she understands why I freaked.

Reddit, AITA?

Edit - Okay I understand, I'm the AH. It hurt to read all of those comments about me being an awful father but they are sort of true. I shouldn't have read the messages and I should've had more control rather than just freaking out. I was shocked, no parent wants to read about their kids sex life. I just wanted to clear a few things up though, not that it will make me any less of an AH.

I do not have any problems with Logan being gay. He came out to me when he was 15, after he got his first boyfriend. He'd come out to his mum a year earlier, it hurt that he felt like he couldn't tell me first but I get it. I told him I didn't have any issues, as long as he was happy.

The problem I have is that he was sleeping around and is still sexually messaging a bunch of men. If he were my daughter instead or was messaging girls I'd still have the same reaction. It's not about his sexuality, it's about him not knowing his self worth, I would love for him to be in a relationship with a nice guy, not sleeping around to feel more secure. Besides, it can be dangerous.

Anyway, I have tried reaching out to Logan but haven't heard anything back. If he does get in contact then I will be ready to apologise, until then I'll keep trying to reach out to him.

Okay last edit here - A lot of people seem to think I'm trying to play psychiatrist when it comes to Logan's self confidence issues. He does have self confidence issues. I don' know whether or not I am part of it but I do know a lot of it was caused by bullying when he was in school. My ex wife and I have spoken about it before and she has admitted that sometimes he won't even let her see him without makeup/hair done etc. as he's not happy with how he looks. Yes, he is brave for wearing what he wears, I see that now, but my ex wife and I both know for a fact that if he had to dye his hair back to his natural colour, leave the make up and wear a generic outfit, he would not be comfortable. Hopefully this clear that up for some people.",2020-11-02 23:16:38,827,2083,0.83,366,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My son (18) stays at home with me and his three siblings (15F, 11M & 9M). We have had a difficult relationship to say the least. I'll call him Max for the sake of this post. Max suffers with some pretty prominent hypersexuality. As soon as he was legal, he started sleeping around with various individuals, most of them being a fair bit older than he was. Naturally I was worried about him so I took him to get checked for STD's, made him delete the contacts of everyone he'd been meeting up with and got my cousin (a therapist) to have a bit of a chat with him.

I had him install a tracking app in his phone and would check his room regularly. I do inspect all my kids bedrooms at least once or twice a week so he wasn't being singled out. Over time he seemed to settle down and even got himself a nice boyfriend who we'll call Adam. I was still wary and made sure that they stayed in the living room area where I could keep an eye on them as I didn't want Max going back to the way he was. They were a very sweet couple and I began to really like Adam, he was a good fit for my son.

However, last week, I got up a bit earlier than usual and decided to have a movie day with the kids, they'd all been doing their own thing lately and I wanted us to have some family time. When I started walking upstairs, near Max's room, I could hear him frantically running around and went to check on him. I asked him if he was okay and he shot me some stupid excuse about looking for clothes. I let it go for a bit and went to wake up his siblings.

I slipped away when everyone was downstairs watching tv and went to Max's room. It took a bit of searching but when I checked in his closet I found a ... well we'll just say an adults toy. I was absolutely mortified. I called him upstairs and questioned him about it. He looked embarrassed but I pushed him to tell me where he got it. He eventually spluttered out something about it being a ""gift"" from Adam. I really didn't know what to say. I grounded him and took his electronics away.

I also threw that thing out (Max was not pleased because it was a ""gift"" from his partner).

Max was absolutely distraught and after losing the argument to get his electronics back, has been giving me the silent treatment. He has refused to speak to me and will only talk to his siblings. I spoke to Max's dad and he thinks that what I did was out of line but my husband says I was 100% in the right, Max shouldn't have those sorts of adult toys in the house. Adam is not much better, he bought it in the first place even after knowing what Max is like.

I feel like I'm justified but my ex won't drop the subject and accused me of humiliating our son (I am his mother and we can be open and talk about anything). AITA?

(EDIT)

I went to bed and woke up with a bunch of YTA comments. I also received a lot of hateful DM's so thanks for that. I am not doing this to argue but I need to set something straight as a few people seem to think I diagnosed my son with hypersexuality. I did not. I'm just going to copy and paste one of my replies as I have to get back to work soon.

When Max was around 14/15 he started watching pornography a lot more than what is healthy at that age (as in staying up most of the night to watch it). When I put parental restrictions in place regarding the internet he resorted to watching shows with a lot of nudity etc. (e.g. Shameless). As soon as he hit legal age (16 in the UK) he started lying to me about study groups at school when in actual fact he was meeting up with total strangers to sleep with them (this would happen several times a week).

He even skipped school several times to meet up with these strangers. It was not safe. He would seek out sex whenever he needed emotional support or was just having a bad day instead of just talking to a friend or family member. The only good thing I can think if is that he seemed to always use protection at least.

I was worried for his safety and took him to several psychiatrists, some of which my ex husband (who I don't get along with) also helped to pick out. They all seemed to agree that Max's sexual behaviour was indeed hypersexuality and that it may be related to his anxiety and depression (two disorders they also diagnosed him with). We went to support groups (which Max was quick to want to drop out of) and he was given medication (which he sometimes refuses to take if he is having a bad day). 

I thought if he avoided sex for a while (like an addict going cold turkey) then he'd calm down a bit but apparently that hasn't worked. I don't want my kids to think sex is bad (I have already had the talk with my second oldest) but Max needs extra attention paid to him to make sure he is safe. I hope this will clear some stuff up for the people who thought I was just saying he was hypersexual.",2020-11-05 23:16:57,808,1245,0.84,341,0,0,0,,,,,,,1,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A year ago, she gave birth to our daughter. Don’t get me wrong- I was excited to have a baby on the way and I wanted to have kids. My parents were also so happy about their first granddaughter. 

However after giving birth my fiance turned into a neurotic mess of a person. And 90 percent of that was due to her body. Her body seemed to have undergone a massive meltdown of sorts and I certainly wasn’t prepared for it.

I was fat in middle school so I have stretch marks but my wife’s pretty much encompassed her whole body. 

She also would repeat annoying phrases to friends like “ my stomach is squishy but our daughter loves it because I’m Mama” or “ I’m perfect in her eyes” In the same breath she complains that her skin looked like a melted candle and it’s honestly too much to bear for me. 

She says that she can’t imagine trying on wedding gowns and for the moment I’m just secretly relieved because she’s impossible to deal with and the last thing I want to do is plan a wedding. 

She’s since started spamming everybody’s Instagram feed with fitness journey videos. My sister and her college friends came home one weekend and were scrolling through her posts and saying the captions she writes is just desperate but I’ve bit my tongue so far.

But yesterday she posted a close up of her stretch marks with the really second hand embarrassment inducing captions to the affect of “ I’m proud of my tiger stripes.”

It got a bunch of likes and comments but honestly I think people just thought it was the acceptable way to react. The pictures were also pretty close up.

I confronted my fiancé  and asked if she’d consider taking it down because it’s just a set of really unattractive pictures. I honestly had to look away and I’m sure our friends who follow her might had that gut reaction too.

She started a long tirade about how strong her body was and how amazing it was as if she was the only woman who’s ever given birth. I finally stopped her and said it was an embarrassing post and walked away.

AITA? Now I caught her complaining about giving her best years to me and a bunch of other stuff over text to her friends.",2020-11-05 12:58:07,734,1815,0.85,294,0,0,0,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bare with me as this is the first time I have ever posted. My younger daughter suggested and showed me how to get onto this site.

So here is the problem.  My oldest daughter has been a flight attendant for 22 years and have been with the same airline that whole time.  This marks the 22 year in a row that we have not been able to spend any holidays with her either.  This was her dream job and she was so excited when she got the interview and hired and made it through training.  We knew at the beginning that she was going to miss some holidays as she got settled in but now she is pretty high up in seniority.

I called her the other day to tell her about our Thanksgiving times and she said that she signed up to take that time since it would be holiday pay and over time.  I was not happy with this and told her that she needs to stop putting her career and job over family.  I told her that it would be nice if for once she would actually spend some with us during the holidays. In turn she told me she was doing this for her future.  She was trying to desperately get her condo paid off so that she didn't have that big payment hanging over her head.  I got mad and told her to do what she thought was right.

So the question is. Am I the asshole for wanting to spend time with my daughter and enjoy the holidays with my entire family?

&#x200B;

Additional info:

She is so much different from us.  She always has been.  We live out in the country in the middle of nowhere.  We are blue collar.  My husband works in a factory and I in an office.  Both of my other kids are happy with this kind of life but she has always wanted more. She went to college and got a degree while she waited to hit the age she needed to apply for her job. She lives two hours away from us and comes home if we are lucky every other month for a day or two and then hurries and just goes right back. We go see her for a couple of days on the off month.

I have hated her job since 9/11. Maybe now it's irrational but I have always had a fear of losing her since that time.  That time was the worst.  We didn't hear from her for three days.  We kept waiting to have someone show at our house to give us news we feared. I have told her this a million times over but she constantly tells me I'm safe. I get that she is happy and loves what she does.  But I feel that she just refuses to find any kind of balance in her life.

Edit.

A lot of you are asking why we can't just reschedule.  We have.  On many occasions we have tried to reschedule many times and all we get is Sorry I gotta work.  Sorry I gotta work.  Sorry I gotta work. So it's not like we don't try.  I did show my husband this post and he is laughing and so am I at this point.  We both decided that at this point we just need to be done.  She is going to do what she wants. You all are right.  Twenty-Two years of this.  I should be used to it at this point. We decided to try  something to prove my point.  We are just not going to contact her .  Lets see how long it takes to see if she realizes that we aren't talking  or visiting. And if we don't hear from her for a while then I guess she is just happier without us. I'll give her her space.",2020-11-16 18:39:37,357,1041,0.91,154,8,7,1,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My parents came to us for Thanksgiving dinner this year. My wife made a great spread. As we were about to eat, the baby started fussing, he has been teething. I told my wife she should go attend to him, but she asked if I would, because she hadn’t eaten all day because she was trying to care for the baby, cook everything and try to visit with my parents and she would really like a warm meal since it had been a while since she had one. I said it would be really rude to my parents to sit down without me, since in my family the hosting family member was always at the table with the guests. My wife asked me again to please go, but I was annoyed and said no. I could tell my wife was irritated, but she went to our baby.

I was thinking we’d wait for her to return, but my dad said he was starving and everything looked fantastic, so I told them to dig in. My wife seemed to be having a hard time getting our son to settle down, but she’s always had the magic touch when it comes to him, so I left her to it. By the time he was content and quiet again, we’d finished and we had moved into the other room. I had left everything on the table and when I went back around she was feeding the baby. I said she should probably clean up once she was done, and she really coldly asked when exactly she was supposed to eat. I was taken by surprise and asked what she was on about, and she told me she still hadn’t eaten anything and I had left a mess instead of at least taking the used dishes to the sink and she knew it was to much to think I’d actually bothered to make her a plate too. 

I got irritated and told her that she was being dramatic and that we were hosting and I thought it was more important to spend time with my parents. She said, I was the one who invited my parents over, but I left her to do everything. I said that wasn’t true, but she asked me to name just one thing I’d done to help her. I was put on the spot and couldn’t think of something, so she said exactly. I got pretty angry, but my mom came in then and asked if she could feed the baby. My wife said yes, then started making herself a plate so she could eat. My mom was upset with me when she realized that my wife still hadn’t eaten.

I have no words to explain the pain. For the first few months I wanted to actually die. Had to stop college because I couldn’t get out of my bed. Therapy helped. I still have bad days but I guess life goes on.  

After me, my therapist and dad all agreed I was well enough I went back to college. College was three hours away by plane so I didn’t go home much. Still talk to my father and sisters daily. 

2 years after my mom died my dad met a woman I will call Lily. They started dating and got married 2 years later. My sisters tell me she is nice. They had a few problems in the beginning when she tried to parent them which was not well received by a 18 and a 17 year old. They both felt (and I agreed) that my parents had already raised us and her input was not necessary or wanted (specially since a few things she tried were different from the way mom and dad raised us). They told dad and he told Lily firmly but politely that he was the parent and he would make the decisions where me and my sisters were concerned. No more problems after that.       

But I just couldn’t. For me Lily is just a walking, talking reminder my mom is gone. I know it’s not fair to her but I just can’t, really. Talked with my therapist and dad. Explained. He told Lily that while I wish her all the best, I'm not open to the idea of a relationship with her. She seemed to understand. 

I barely hear anything about her nowadays. Only when my sisters really want to say something to me and there is no way not to include her. When I go home I stay with my grandparents and if she is joining us for something I suddenly have plans with old friends, sorry. My dad and sisters only visited me once, when I graduated. Could only invite a certain number of people and I have a big family besides my dad and sisters. They took priority so she did not go.

Basically, I haven’t met Lily in the four years she and dad have been together. Never even talked to her. Dad understands and the rest of my family or understands or doesn’t care. 

Well, last week I got a call from an unknown number. It was Lily. She was clearly upset. Said it has been years and that she is a part of my dad’s life and I was selfish for excluding her from one of the three most important things for him (me and my sisters). She said she wants to at least be my friend. Went on and on about not being fair to her that I don’t want anything to do with her. 

When I finally got to talk I was a mess so I only said “You are a part of my dad’s life, yes. You are his wife. And that’s all you are to me. I’m sorry but I have no interest in meeting you or talking to you again. Bye.” Finished the call and went to sleep. Slept for 14 hours.  

Apparently, she is unconsolable. Told my dad what happened. He didn’t know she would call. Dad is upset but understands. My boyfriend says I was completely in the right. But Lily absolutely thinks I’m the asshole. AITA, reddit?",2020-11-12 06:48:55,481,1084,0.94,136,21,65,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My sister, her husband and their son and daughter came to visit us for dinner yesterday where we had a bit of a disagreement. 

When we were growing up, our parents always taught us to speak properly and dress nicely, and their advice has been very helpful. We both got into top universities (sister went to Oxford) and now have great careers. Her husband is very working class and from the North of England, which is where they live now. 

Sister and I were both privately educated, but she and her husband chose to send their kids to a normal school. 

Their kids are 13 and 11, and have very thick accents. They don't swear or anything like that, but they do use a lot of regional slang, half of which I don't understand. 

As they were leaving, I had a word with my sister in private, saying that she should think about asking her kids to talk properly, that it will be a struggle for them later in life with strong accents and slang. 

My sister responded by asking what that was meant to mean, and said that how she chooses to parent her children is her business only. She didn't say goodbye and just left. 

I'm not sure how to feel about this. I feel like these kids - who are lovely, intelligent and well behaved - will miss out on a lot of opportunities because they aren't well spoken. My sister and I were both taught these lessons from a very early age, but she seems to have forgotten it all.

I have four children

* Adam - 21m
* Jude - 17m
* Alexis - 8f
* Jake - 5m

Jude has always had difficulty when it came to emotions. He was never an overly affectionate child. At around 5 or 6 he started trying to wriggle out of hugs, avoided kisses and would complain of someone was too close to him. I accepted this as just how he was and compromised. Instead of a hug/kiss, I'd give him a high five or a fist bump. His siblings are all very affectionate so I don't know what happened with him.

He's not completely emotionless but it's often pretty hard to tell what he's thinking/feeling at any given moment. If he's mad he'll leave the room to be alone or just ignore whoever is making him mad. He'll smile if he's happy of course and I have seen him cry a few times, like when the family dog passed away, but most of the time he's like a complete robot. He doesn't tell us that he loves us or compliment us at all. When Alexis did took part in her first school play, Jude gave her a high five after the show but he didn't *say* anything.

It bothers me but I have kept my mouth shut because overall Jude is a good boy. He's never hurt anyone, he does well in school and at his part time job (before covid hit) and never hesitates to help me around the house. But it just gets to me that he acts so emotionless all the time. It's like living with a cyborg.

So, two nights ago, my partner proposed to me. I was absolutely overjoyed and couldn't wait to tell the kids. I called them all down and let them know. All of them were thrilled and I was hugged and congratulated by each of them.

Except Jude.

He hung back a little bit before giving me a pat of the arm and saying ""that's great"". Now I know it was genuine. He smiled at me and I know if my boy is lying. But I was absolutely devastated. I had accepted the fact that Jude is not one for feelings but I had just hoped for once that he'd get over it and just congratulate me for once, give me a hug and act genuinely excited about the wedding. I couldn't help myself and I burst into tears and asked him why he couldn't just once act like a normal human being. Why he couldn't stop acting like a robot for once in his life.

It had come out before I even realised what I'd said. Jude just stood there in shock for a second before heading off to his bedroom and locking the door. I do feel sort of like TA here as Jude is a kind soul. He doesn't tell his siblings that he loves them but he makes up for it by showing them that he loves them (buying them presents he knows they'll like, helping them with their homework, helping them make costumes for Halloween etc.). But I also feel like he should be trying to get over this emotionless phase, he's 17 after all, he knows his behaviour just isn't normal. My fiance agrees with me though he does feel like I could have been a bit less harsh. AITA?",2020-11-20 18:23:32,387,468,0.83,202,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jt87l3/aita_daughter_says_i_have_no_right_to_be/,AITA: daughter says I have no right to be concerned about her eating habits,"I (36M) am a father to a 17 year old girl. She's my oldest of three children.

Two years ago, my daughter had a problem with eating large quantities of food in one sitting. It got to the point where she was eating other people's food and we even had to lock our pantry for quite a while because she would eat just for the sake of it when she was bored. That lasted until she found the key to the lock we used and helped herself knowing our rules. 

She didn't have a weight problem per-se but she did have a delusion. She thought she was underweight but in reality her weight was perfectly normal to that of her age group. Admittedly she grew up hearing comments from extended family about how skinny she was as a child, and she went on thinking she was still underweight in her teenage years despite having caught up.

One day we got into an argument about how much she ate and I made the decision to put her on a diet. Nothing major, just reducing how much she ate. I thought it was quite fair to say that she was to only eat three times a day. Breakfast, lunch and dinner. If we had pudding or something of the sort she would also be allowed to have a small snack after dinner.

This obviously started a heated argument, with her demanding to know why I was doing this and me saying that it was out of control and that she could end up gaining an unhealthy amount of weight. She responded by saying she was only 120 lbs, and without thinking I told her that when I was her age that was considered a bit big for a girl.

Fast forward two years later. Lately she's not been eating more than once a day and she waits until 10 PM to eat anything. She's definitely hungry before then but during a conversation with a friend she let it slip that she chews gum to minimize her stomach pain. Her weight has also dropped to only 110 lbs.

I grew concerned, and I told her it worried me how she was going about eating. She snapped immediately, called me an asshole and told me it's my fault because what I said to her two years ago had apparently stuck with her and then said since I'm the problem, I have no right to try to intervene. 

I told her I think it is incredibly unfair and manipulative for her to blame me for her own troubles with food. I told her I was sorry that she interpreted what I said as her needing to starve herself but that she needs to start taking responsibility for her own decisions.

My wife disagrees with me and basically has the mentality of ""you reap what you sow"" but I read that someone using a scapegoat for their eating disorder is very common and in that case the scapegoat happened to be me.

We live together. Once a month, she goes to her workplace's second location, which is about an hour away in a different city. 

Yesterday, I went to pick her up from work after her evening shift. She was going to take the bus, but called at the last minute to see if I could come get her because she was tired, and because it was dark out. 

When she got in the car, I made a joke about how she looked like a mess. I thought it was obvious that I was joking, but she got upset at me for saying it. We started to argue, so I said something along the lines of ""I didn't even get a thank you for going out of my way to come pick you up.""

My girlfriend responded with ""Fine, let me out at the next bus station, I'll take the bus instead."" I ignored her, but she kept repeating herself, so I pulled over on the side of the highway and told her to get out. 

She said she wasn't going to get out on the highway (not a real highway, just a long road that connects the cities), but I told her if she wanted to get out of the car so badly, she could get out here. She just stared at me and only got out once I started yelling. I pulled away and drove to the next bus station to wait for her, because I just wanted to teach her a lesson.

The station was a 15 minute walk, max. After 20 minutes of waiting she still hadn't gotten there, so I called her to make sure she was okay. She started crying on the phone and told me she had called a friend (who lives in the other city) to come pick her up, and that she was staying with her for the night. I tried to talk to her but she hung up. 

I drove out to pick her up this morning and we had a completely silent car ride. Once we got home, she called me an asshole and locked herself in our bedroom. She eventually came out and we fought over this. She said I'm a shitty person for stranding her on the side of the highway at night, and I told her she was the one who asked to get out of the car in the first place.

I take the bus to and from work (car got totaled about a month ago, still waiting on insurance to reimburse me so I can get a new one), and right now on public transit you have to social distance. This means limited seating.

At my job, I’m literally on my feet all day, and I work 10 hour shifts. It sucks but the pay is good, so I can deal, but after a long day, my feet are sore AF. I genuinely cherish the time I spend sitting on the bus ride home, knowing I have to walk another 15-20 minutes to my house from the bus stop. Which means more time on my feet.

So last night I’m on the bus, and a very heavily pregnant lady gets on. She looks around for a seat, only to find there are no available ones left. I’m the closest to her, so she starts giving me the imploring eyes. I had my headphones on and tried to pretend I couldn’t see her, but once she started talking to me it became inevitable. 

I wasn’t rude or anything, I just told her no, I’ve had a long day and my feet are sore. I don’t want to give up my seat. She started crying about how she’s a pregnant single mom, and I told her I’m sorry, but that was her personal choice and she can’t expect other people to accommodate her life choices. We live in a state where birth control and abortions are free, so I don’t know why this should be my problem. It’s not my fault she decided to have a baby when she can’t afford a car.

After going back and forth for a bit, an old man finally shouted that I’m a “worthless punk” and offered his seat to the lady. He started ranting and raving about the “damn millennials” and I just looked the other way and pretended I didn’t hear it. As they were trading seats, the bus driver had to slam the brakes for whatever reason, and the pregnant lady and the old man both fell. They started yelling at me, calling me all sorts of nasty names, but I just looked the other way and ignored it.

When I got home and told my sister, she flipped the fuck out and went crying to our parents, who also chewed my ass out. But I was tired and had a long day, and I don’t know why we need to keep perpetuating the idea that breeding somehow means your entitled to people’s seats. I’m tired, too, we’re all tired in this pandemic. AITA, though?",2020-10-23 02:36:03,1292,2042,0.85,69,1,78,11,,,,,,2,3,,,,1,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have a sister who has a horrible drug problem. She's a horrible burden on everyone and i think she's beyond help. She's went through rehab and everything. It's to the point where you almost never see her sober anymore. She lives with me and has no job whatsoever.

It seems like once a week, she'll go get wasted on pills and come back to the house and pass out. Same story last week, only that we had to call an ambulance and after she got home from the hospita, she promised she'd change. I was proud, until she came back with the same thing just a few days later. She came in mumbling, her eyes glazed over and sure enough, she passed out on her bed.

Nobody knows the real her. So, i was pretty angry about it, the way she lied to us all about changing. And disappointed, so i took a picture of her passed out and put it on Facebook. Her friends saw it, the commenters were all horrified. Sure enough, when she woke up, she got really angry and started airing all my dirty laundry on Facebook too. Mostly made up stuff and nobody believed her.

I know it was extreme, but was it justified? Because we've done literally everything we can do to help her. I've even gotten her a job which she blew off after a day. The one day she did show up, she just passed out at her cubicle.",2020-11-19 03:43:07,308,891,0.89,140,1,7,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For those in the extreme minority that said NTA, read the YTA comments and you should be easily swayed. 

Happened this morning. I (37M) am having a problem with my Internet and broadband, so I call the help desk and am going through the necessary checks when the call worker baffled me.

Now for context, my name is similar to Thomas Ryefield but I go as Tom, and you'll struggle to find someone with my surname unless we are related

The worker is asking me questions and asks me to confirm my name, to which I do and she says its wrong and doesn't match the account. I ask is she sure, she checks it again and says its wrong, and that I'll have to go to my account to update my details.

I'm completely baffled now as I've called a couple of times earlier this week. 

EDIT: We go back and forth checking but still no joy. 

Before I go and change my details, I check a final time:

""Is the surname on your record Ryefield?""

Yes, she says.

""Is the first name Thomas?""

No, she says.

""Is it a short form of my first name?""

No, she says.

""So it's not Tom then?""

Yes that's correct, thanks for confirming, she says. 

""Are you serious, Tom is the short form for Thomas!"" 

She tries to tell me that it's not, my own name! 

EDIT: There was no yelling involved. 
EDIT: she argued with me about my own name saying that the short form of my name is not the short form of my name.
EDIT: Subsequent staff had no issues accepting the short form of my name, she did not know that the short form of my name is the short form of my name.

We had all the same interest, same views, same goals in life. The only issue we had was how we felt about each other's appearance. I don't need a woman who hides herself with make up, in fact I oppose that, but I do like my woman to have her hair managed and does dress up a little when we go on dates. Now my then girlfriend wasn't like that - she had a masculine sense of fashion and let her frizzy hair wayward. After our talk we set some ground rules - we weren't going to change our appearances for one another, but there were factors we take into consideration; she liked a well trimmed beard and certain length hair cut so I made sure to maintain those things. I asked she put some effort into how she dressed on our date. I never said it had to be a dress, but just a nice blouse.

8 months in of dating we almost broke up because while I fulfilled my end of the bargain, she never did. I explained I didn't want her to be uncomfortable and what I want shouldn't come before that, so it was best we split. She decided she loved me and put in more of an effort.

We get married, move in together and life gets rolling. But as it does she went back into her old ways of never dressing up or managing her hair. I still keep my beard trim the way she likes it, along with my hair cut. When I mentioned it to her she shrugs and says, 'we're married now, it doesn't matter'. To me it does.

She has 2 close friends - both wives and moms too. Whenever I see them they're both dressed nicely and cleaned up. They invite my wife to get her hair trimmed with them or attend a yoga class but she always say no, she's pretty enough she doesn't need those things. It frustrates me. Yesterday she was mocking her friend for getting highlights in her hair, saying it was ridiculous and unnatural, and I snapped back I wish she would take care of herself like her friends do. She left for her parents, both who are blowing up my phone now and trying to get me to bring our son over.

I felt bad about saying no so I've always agreed if they're a close friend or family member. 

My wife just assumed I would make one now that she's pregnant, but I told her that I wouldn't this time because I hate these projects and have enough going on as is. They take away from other things I'd rather be doing instead, and it's tedious work that I don't enjoy. 

She didn't like my answer and thinks I'm an asshole for being willing to do it for others but not her or our baby. She feels like it's a sign I'm not committed or don't value our baby enough. My logic is that since it's my baby I should not have to do a project I hate, but she does not see it that way.

He is still around and pays child, but she's mostly raising the kids on her own.

She has been single for quite some time and recently tried to start dating again. My sister thinks of herself as a 'good catch' (college degree, well traveled, good job, above average looking) but after spending the last year not having much luck with dating she's getting frustrated. According to her only losers with credit card debt or a marijuana addiction are interested in her, and she asked me for a 'guy's opinion'. 

I told her she should get more realistic when it comes to her dating standards. While she has a lot of things going for her most guys don't want to date single moms. It’s not that it’s her fault, but there’s a host of shit a guy can end up having to deal with, like the ex being a fixture in your life, the kid giving you shit about not being their real dad, you not being her first priority, etc.

I literally pay for everything he owns.,"My wife(26) and I (M29) had our first son about 10 months ago. Because childcare is costly in my area, along with the obvious risks regarding daycares, we agreed that she’d be a SAHM. So i picked up more hours at work. I work the graveyard shift in a warehouse 12hrs a day Sunday night through Thursday night, and 6-8hrs on Friday night. For a grand total of 66-68hrs a week. 

By the time i come home in the morning my wife and son are both up and shes making breakfast for us while feeding our son. I’ll usually take my food into our bedroom and eat in there before winding down for bed. But I usually don’t fall asleep until around noon. So I don’t get much sleep.

Recently however she started bringing our son into the room with and asking me to play with him or give him a bottle and a change before i go to sleep. But i thought thats what she was for considering all she does is take care of him. Id do it usually but it’s been really irking me.

This morning it got heated when she tried to hand me my son as im getting ready to fall asleep. She said that i needed to “step up more as a father.” I laughed and pointed around and said “well im paying for this house we’re living in, the clothes our son is wearing. The formula and water that he eats and his baby food. We agreed that you’d do the house stuff, why is it now my responsibility and why right before im going to bed?!” 

She didn’t say anything and just took our son into his room and locked the door. I texted my mom and she started reaming me out. But honestly this was our original agreement so I don’t see a problem. This is extremely frustrating and i think i need someone from the outside to give me a perspective.

It wasn't even a big mountain. Basically I've been going on hikes alone on weekend mornings while my girlfriend eats pancakes.

On Sunday I went to do a peak that's easy if you're a vet like me but still takes a few hours. I went early so I could be back for the football game at one. I could not miss this game. So I woke up early to go and my girlfriend gets up with me and is like ""Let's do it"" and I was like what. She gives me this whole spiel about trying to better herself and her body which she gives me every year but I still felt obligated to bring her along.

Before I agreed I made sure she understood that it would be challenging and that I was going to be going at a brisk pace because I needed to be home in time for the game. I told her that if she wanted we could do some lighter hikes later this week so she can ease her self into it but she insisted she could keep up.

But of course it didn't go that way. She fell behind immediately, before the real ascent even began. I offered to turn around and tackle it another time but she insisted she just needed to adjust to the altitude change. Nope. It took us over two hours to get up, and she complained and begged for water the entire time.

We got to the top and I told her we needed to get down faster than we went up because if we didn't I was going to miss kickoff. She got all pissy over that and was like isn't spending time with me more important than the game. I knew this was bait so I just said back that I told her the conditions beforehand and it wasn't respectful of her to slow me down like this. Then she got real mad and basically shrieked across the entire peak that I might as well just leave her up there and I was so angered and embarrassed by her that I did.

I told her the descent down was easier and there were plenty of people around to help her if she needed it and I headed back down the mountain alone. I felt bad so I waited for her in the car and watched the game on my phone and she didn't make it down until the 4th quarter which I pointed out to her as soon as she opened the door.

Side note - her nickname is Baby Bird because she flaps her hands like little wings while she’s running and playing. Somebody made a comment I didn’t quite catch but it was about something my niece was doing and my SIL shrugged and passively said, “well, she might be autistic. This was the first time that had ever been mentioned and of course we all had questions. SIL said when she took the baby for her checkup, the pediatrician said she was showing signs of what may be autism. I asked her how she felt and if she was okay, and she laughed and said, “It’s a nonissue. We always knew she was a bit throwed off, we just have a name for it now!” 

Everyone laughed and I asked her what she meant by that. She described all the “autistic tendencies” (her words not mine), and said she didn’t care, she wouldn’t treat or love her any differently. I told her that was a horrible way to talk about her daughter. Everyone got quiet and just stared at me, and my husband was giving me a look like he wished a hole in the earth would swallow me. But I kept on. I told her she can’t treat her the same way, because she’ll have special needs and won’t function the same as other kids. I told her, she’s not “throwed off. She’s autistic.” 

My SIL stared at me for a moment, and then said, “thanks for that, Melanie Barnett” (which??? Wtf even is that???” And then left.

We moved into a house with 4 bedrooms: upstairs, large master and medium-ish bedroom, main level, large and small bedroom. The small bedroom was in the back corner of the house, and since April had a quiet voice we wanted her where we could hear her easily. Sam didn’t want the small bedroom (it was quite small) and thought this was unfair as she was much older, so we compromised by turning the small bedroom into an office. The girls shared a room. April was easily heard and Sam was only with me on weekends so it didn’t even make sense for her to take up a whole room all the time.

Sam was unhappy with this arrangement from the get-go. It didn’t help that she kept butting heads with her sister. April would push buttons, Sam would react, and it would turn into a sobbing mess. April, being six, would also sometimes make kid mistakes like doodling in Sam’s books, and this would cause Sam to melt down even when I tried to fix it. Sam complained that April had a larger bed than her. We had gotten a bunk bed for the room, and April was safer on the bottom bunk as she could have fallen out of the top. So Sam had the top bunk, which was smaller than the bottom. Also, again, she was only there on weekends.

I explained the reasons over and over again: she wasn’t here enough to warrant taking away my office, and I needed to be able to hear April. I told her if she spoke to her dad and started living with me during the week, we could turn the office into a bedroom. She agreed, after many of these discussions, and came to live with me. She got the small room and boom, angry again. She expected the big room. She never told me but I learned she was also angry as her (very high quality!) mattress sat on the floor for a while. It was a very good mattress and a frame would have taken up valuable space. She stayed with me for about two years before going back to her dad’s pretty much full time. No matter what I did she wasn't happy.

I haven’t heard from her in a couple years. We had a big fight. She wouldn’t tell me why she was so cold with me all the time, then she stopped talking to me. I found an old journal she’d forgotten at my house a few years back and I hadn’t read it, but very recently I missed her so much, I did. There was a lot, mostly rants and notes and some journal-type stuff. She wrote a rant about how I’d used a bedroom to “manipulate” her into living with me, how awful it was, and how it felt like a prison cell with “just a chunk of foam on the floor to lie on and a little desk in the corner.” She makes it sound like I tortured her with an expensive mattress and her own room, which I didn’t even need to give her. Lots of siblings have to share rooms for years.

I’m close to the limit so I guess now I just need to ask: AITA? Did I go too far in not giving her the room she wanted?",2020-11-18 22:27:03,412,411,0.83,111,0,2,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

H and I had only been on a few dates when I got pregnant. We were both childfree and I’m about to tell you why we kept S despite this.

H was going to split the cost of an abortion with me, but had to ask his mom for the money. You see, our parents respected our decision to be childfree, but we were their only kids and hopes at grandchildren. Basically H’s mom wanted a grandchild and so did my parents, who wouldn’t help me with the abortion fees but were willing to front a bunch of money for their future grandkid.

The money they were offering would have helped H and I pay off student loans and then had some change. And our parents were willing to help out with the kid while we finished college. So we took my parents’ money and had S, who was raised by his grandparents his first 4 years while we went to school.

When H and I graduated, we got decent jobs but couldn’t afford to live in a safe enough neighborhood. We had to use my parents’ money to be able to afford a big enough apartment in a nice safe area where S had other kids to play with too.

S had a decent childhood and H and I do love him but we’re depressed because we haven’t had our lives to ourselves. We literally only had this kid because of the payout. But we do our best to make sure he can’t pick up on it.

S graduated high school this year and plans to start college when the world is less shitty. He spent this past weekend at my parents’. They apparently told him about the money they gave H and I intended for him and he got all excited about his college fund.

The thing is, there’s only a few thousand of it left. It’s of course all his and we wouldn’t dream of touching it. But it’s not enough to cover his whole college. He flipped out when we explained this to him.

He began to scream at us for squandering his college fund and said we had no right. But we didn’t “squander” it. We used it on our debt, a big enough and safe place to stay, and some pricey extracurriculars he insisted on taking as a kid. We had to use that money to give him a stable childhood. We didn’t want to raise the kid while penny pinching and living in an unsafe environment.

Now my parents are starting to yell at me for wasting their money. But there was never a verbal or written agreement that the money was his college fund. It was “for him” and we used it to give him his secure childhood.

Are we assholes for not saving all of the money for when he went to college?

This happened a few years ago and it recently came up again. I don’t think I was TA here but I’ll let a collective third party judge. 

My daughter was set to graduate college and wasn’t too excited about attending her graduation. I thought this was unfair because I paid for her college and graduation is supposed to be fun and a chance to let loved ones celebrate too. So she agreed after I made that argument. 

A few weeks in advance, my daughter asked if I had invited anyone to her graduation because she wanted to go to a certain restaurant afterwards and they apparently book fast. I told her I only invited a couple of the neighbors and our family friends. 

The day of her graduation, we all went to the venue and waited for the ceremony to begin. After it did, I called my daughter asking if she could see me in the bleachers, and even waved so she could see me. I asked her to wave back but I couldn’t see her do so and she wouldn’t stay on the phone. 

After the ceremony, I had to call her multiple times because everyone there wanted to congratulate her. I saw her taking pictures with her friends I never liked and told her to hurry up because it’s rude to ignore your guests.

When she finally joined us, she saw there were more people than she booked a table for. She called the restaurant and they told her they couldn’t accommodate extra people, causing her to cancel her reservation. 

I immediately suggested another place which I knew had vegetarian options because all of us except my daughter are vegetarian. What if that place had limited vegetarian options?

We all went out to eat at the place I suggested and went home. That day was never spoken of again until recently. My younger daughter graduated over the spring but for obvious reasons, she didn’t get a graduation ceremony. The older one immediately said she’d trade if she could because it was a shitty day. 

I immediately asked her why she thought that and she snapped at me. She said she only went to her graduation because it was on Mother’s Day and it made me happy. And that the whole day was me calling the shots and blowing up her phone from start to finish. 

She also said she knew I was in the bleachers and she couldn’t just stand up and wave in the middle of the ceremony, that she at least wanted to take some pictures with her friends but I rushed her out of doing that, and deliberately schemed to make sure we went to the same place I always want to go to, whose dishes I make at home every day.

I told her that we, her family, cared more about her than her friends, and that she ended up going to the other restaurant with her friends for her birthday a few months later so it’s not like we prevented her from ever going to that restaurant. I also reminded her that her guests were vegetarians and asked what if they didn’t have any vegetarian options at her restaurant.

She said she didn’t want to argue over what’s already happened and left the room. So Reddit, who’s TA here?",2020-10-14 15:40:57,1361,3149,0.88,351,0,0,0,,,,,,,,2,3,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I told her as soon as she goes to sleep I would be headed home (8 minutes away from the hospital) and that she could call me for anything I wouldn’t be gone long.
I followed through with my plan and now she says I’m an asshole for “abandoning” her at the hospital and that I don’t care about her or the baby. 
I’m just trying to be functional, am I the asshole?

Lori came to work for us during WFH. No one got to know her other than the brief online introductions and things shared in the group chats. She was pretty funny in the group chats, but I noticed a trend.

Lori parrots everything you expect to see on Reddit pages, Tumblr, and FB. It's hard to explain, but stuff like ""Oatmeal raisin cookies are the reason I have trust issues"" and ""I don't trust people who don't like dogs"" and all that doggo pupper goo goo ga ga pibble wibble woo woo shit, even older, dated stuff like Epic Fail or But I am Le Tired? It's all she would say. 

Once we transitioned to being back in the office, I figured hey, I'm excited to get to know this woman because she must be different IRL. She's actually worse because while you expect some of the things Redditors or other ""online people"" say when you're online, in person it's just... awkward.

For example, when we were chatting in the break room (distanced, of course), she was showing pictures of her dog to people and she kept saying ""I don't trust people who don't LOVE dogs. Look at my doggo! He's such a good little pupper!"" and people were looking at her like... uh, okay. She turned to someone else and asked about their pets and the girl said ""Oh, I have a cat, here's a pic-"" and Lori just repeated ""UGH, I just do NOT trust people who don't like dogs. Whoever said cats were the new dog is *seriously disturbed*.""

People started to avoid her. At one point she sat with me at lunch and talked about how she might look for a new job because the people at ours are ""weird"" and ""kind of mean.""

I said to her, ""Didn't you basically yell at Jenny because she has a cat? You went on some weird awkward rant about people who don't like dogs. You think that could be part of the issue?""

She got quiet and said ""Well there's something seriously disturbed about people who don't like dogs. It's not my fault. I don't make the rules. Why, did someone say something?""

I thought for like 15 seconds and was like well, fuck it, I don't think anything is going to get through to this one. I said ""People don't like to talk to you because you act like a walking, talking Reddit meme page. Everything you say is just a tired, regurgitated joke from the internet. It's weird. Maybe if you stopped talking like someone who spends every day refreshing Reddit things would change?""

And of course, she started to cry. She left her lunch and just went back to her cubicle and grabbed her stuff and left. She ended up taking a few days off, and when she came back she was just quiet and didn't talk to anyone. I feel bad that she feels bad, but do I really have to?

He held a wedding this past weekend, (socially distant, everyone was spread out and it was entirely outdoors). In the weeks leading up to the wedding, I told my girlfriend to wear white as it was expected all the women would wear it. She was reluctant but I told her that it was just a quirky thing the bridge and groom were doing, so she said ""ok"" and bought a white dress.

When we got to the wedding, it was standard wedding attire and my girlfriend was mortified. When my best friend saw what I had done, he was cracking up and joked ""I guess you two are getting married instead of us!""

The bride was pissed off and made a huge deal out of it. Normally she is really chill so I was surprised by her anger. My friend even tried to calm her down and told her it was just clothing and it doesn't change anything.

He has some diet meals (Healthy Choice dinners) but gives into cravings a lot for the bad stuff, so they go unopened.

The main tiff between the fiancé and I at the moment is the bridal party, well the flower girl. He's 29 but has a much younger, biological sister whose 8. Because of the difference they're relationship is more uncle and niece then brother and sister. 

I have a niece from my older sister, whose nine, but I'm a big sister to her.

Getting engaged, I knew right away my niece was going to be my flower girl. Whenever my fiancé and I drop by his parents, his little sister asks if she can be flower girl. It's a little awkward. I'm not close to her. Again, my fiancé isn't close to her. I joke she's going to need to fight my niece over that.

My gf (24) and I (21M) had kids before we were financially stable, they were both oopsies and while we’re happy with our boys we struggle when unexpected expenses drop and we have no savings. 

My sister (29) raised my brother (16) and I and adopted us both, so don’t ask about my parents please. She and her husband send us money weekly and take our kids on a Fun Day once a month. They put aside some money for our sons adulthood, which I am ever so thankful for (they hold the saving accts.)

My gf has had issues with my sister since we announced we were expecting the first time. My sister has no poker face so it was obvious she was upset for a few hours despite her congratulations. I moved in with my gfs parents when I graduated and my son was born soon after so we had help, but GF expected sister to be more hands on. To this day gf thinks sister is trying to buy our sons love instead of taking care of them even half as often her parents do. I told her that wasn’t fair but it just starts an argument. 

More recently, my brother texted me “get your **nt gf back in line and raise your own failed pullouts” which is harsh for him. Turned out Gf had dropped the boys off at my sisters for a sleepover without asking and told her “to act like family”. TBH I don’t think gf told the full story coz later my sister called apologising for my childhood, she’s trying her best to keep me and my family happy and secure but she’s not Wonder Woman; she’s DONE raising other people’s kids (and my brother has been punished, a bit harshly imo). 

There’s tension coz my gf wants to cut contact with them coz of the text and call, but not before they transfer us our sons savings and agree to send the payments (her word) directly to us so they can’t be financially manipulative. I refuse: it’s beyond insulting, stupidly shortsighted, and I’m not cutting contact over this. 

My gf says it’s our kids money so we get final say in where it goes and we need it now so sister should respect that. I don’t want that, life isn’t lavish but our needs are met. I feel safer knowing my sister is saving for our sons futures: they’re putting in more money monthly than we could in 6. It’s self serving, I know that, but it’s true. But now gf calls my sister controlling and spiteful coz if she truly loved our sons and wanted what was best for them she would keep sending it even if we cut contact. 

I’m NOT cutting contact over teen angst that I chewed him out for and my sister shut down ASAP: I’ll ask for some distance but that’s it. Gf dropped it but is still asking for them to give us our sons savings. I’m scared of what backlash could be tbh, but gf is right, that money as an emergency fund would help us A LOT, we could breathe a bit easier at the end of the month, its the one thing her parents can’t help with. But it feels very wrong and dirty. 

So WIBTA for not asking (and hoping it calms down)?

Edit: ok the amount of negative comments is overwhelming. I get that my sister did a lot, but shouldn’t that make her more sympathetic to our situation? She has adhd and maybe autism, my gfs family are a lot more affectionate than she was, at least they say “I love you” almost daily. 

My sons are 3 and 1, they’re not the easiest ages to handle, some support from my side of the family would be nice, it’s always gfs family babysitting. I also don’t think my gf is toxic or entitled, just stressed and overwhelmed.

Edit 2: I wasn’t clear but the money likely comes from my sisters husband. He’s a coder, so he’s flushed, he moved her and my brother into his house, and she’s a waitress doing an online degree, so I don’t think she makes enough a ton? Also, she doesn’t want to be pregnant and her husband can’t have kids, so I think they’re childfree but not really because my brother calls him dad ? *and he’s always happy to see my kids, he’s always taking them to expensive places I know my sister can’t afford

**edit 3, probably final** the tide went from NTA to yta real fast. I feel like nothing here is straightforward and black and white. I feel like as much as I can appreciate my sister, I can feel sad that I missed out of the whole warm unconditionally loving nuclear family my gf had and introduced me to. They had a lot of questions about my sister and like I knew she wasn’t “normal”, but they seemed horrified at some of my stories? 

I know some (like having all 3 share a bed in a 1 bedroom apartment when she first “adopted” -it wasn’t legal yet she just snuck in, packed our bags and snuck us out) weren’t her fault per se, but it still made me realise that she did some shady stuff, she just always got lucky coz people pitied us. Even the landlord was nice about her having 2 kids im a 1 person rental and put a futon in there. And Like she used to steal food right? Then she got caught, and that dude set up her with an Italian restaurant (owned by the brother of the guy who caught her stealing!!) who gave her their leftovers, and even clothes the kids no longer wore, pads/tampons, toys for Xmas. It’s like she had her own private shelter and she even was a bridesmaid for that guys niece last year. Some real Oliver Twist shit I didn’t think actually happened irl. Even this one dealer would give her a free joint when he saw her, I don’t think she even knew his name. Stuff I found funny/sweet, my gfs family looked traumatised. So yea.... not a normal upbringing. 

I didn’t mean to bash my sister with the adhd comments, but I don’t know if you actually know what it’s like living with someone who shuts down when she’s overly stimulated or gets fits of energy and bugs out until she goes out for a walk, no matter time of day or weather. It doesn’t sound that bad, but it happens during dinner, movie time, homework help, in the middle of night.... plus there’s the whole start one thing and 3 hours later she’s actually started 5 others things, nothings finished and probably won’t be for like a week unless it’s urgent. It’s not abusive, it’s hist a lot to deal with you know?

I know it isn’t in her nature to be maternal and she admitted she’s not sure shes ever felt LOVE because she can’t relate to any media about it. (I know she does live us in her own way, but it’s hurts hearing her say that.) It’s complicated between us, but she is my sister/mother figure, even if the money stopped I wouldn’t want to lose contact. That was never an option in my mind. 

I understand where the comments related to money came from. For the record, I’m not keeping contact with my sister for the money. I don’t sound credible because I literally said it’s smarter to let her keep the account because she could put more into it, but hey, I’m an AH on behalf of my sons, not stupid.  With the money I was simply pointing out that I *understand* my gfs POV and some cash could help us (short term, not long term, I really do want my sons to have the full amount). No one in her family can help with it, my sister probably couldn’t/wouldn’t of her husband wasnt so chill. 

I asked my sister for money when we moved out of my in laws, and the second pregnancy was more complicated. She sent us money but after she got married she cut down her work hours yet the money I received tripled. I have thanked her and her husband and made them ty cards from my kids. I know this post made me sound really bad and money hungry, but please know this is just what’s going on recently, not reflective of the time before, I don’t take her money for granted and my sister knows this. But I’ll never be able to pay her back and they know it. 

I rarely think about the boys savings unless I stress over the boys futures. I certainly don’t consider it theirs, it’s legally my sisters until she gifts it. I hate that this is even a fight between gf and I because I get her POV but I can’t bring myself to ask my sister about it or ask for more money/loan I feel too guilty. I can’t ask her to stop the weekly help, we’re struggling without it some months. Someone asked, we get 250 a week. When she drew up the plans for my sons savings, she committed to 150/month but her husbands slipped once and said he sends in 500 (250 per child).

So like yea. some distance between my sister and gf for a bit would do some good. I’m going to have to explain to bf that my sister can’t be fill traditional aunt/grandma roles because while she’s both, she has very little free time. she’s trying to catch up her education and career (she’s transferring to a more reputable school with in person learning to finish her degree), and my brother has been really struggling with remote learning this year so she and her husband spend a lot of time helping him. My brother also has adhd so that’s got my sister very stressed, because they’ve yet to find meds that work for him. Just saying that stress may have led to the explosion. 

I don’t think my gf is toxic or manipulative, No more than my sister was at her age. Imma tell her to back off my sister and forget about the boys savings, we have a long way to go before it’s theirs, and it won’t be a life changing amount, just a boost to entre the adult world. But er, my gf holds grudges so the tension will be here for a while I think. If I ever throw her families lack of financial help in her face again I can kiss my sons goodbye, it’s a sore spot for her. 

Well. My question was “AITA for not asking my sister to transfer us our sons money”. Imma take it the verdict is “no, stand my ground, my sister is a modern day saint, I need to get my shit together”. Stuff I knew and unbiased brutal honesty is a real shake up I won’t lie. 

Maybe I’ll update if shit gets interesting. I’m really realllly hoping to get this behind us drama free though. Maybe I’ll answer more questions, but I got hat I came for

Edit 4: the bloody knife award? Realy? Ok 
How am. Still getting shit awards for this? Surely there’s more interesting posts?

I have a Son and a Daughter. I made a pact that I would help both of them with down payment for their house after marriage. 

My Daughter married a high earner, whereas my Son married a single mom with 2 kids. 

Both my Daughter and SIL work, so I figured they can manage easily to pay for their house. My Son on the other hand is the sole earner, and earns pretty mediocre, and helping him alone with the down payment seemed correct, so I did just that. 

Upon hearing what I did, my Daughter threw a hissy fit and demanded that I help her as well. I sat her down and explained her Brothers situation, and how he is struggling as a sole earner of the house. My Daughter doesn't have any kids, but my Son has two, so more reasoning went into this.

I told him a few months ago and he is trying to build a relationship with our son.

Last year he fell in love with Sabrina who he had known for while and got married. I kind of knew Sabrina from far and she looks like someone who thinks highly of herself, i never understood why Matt was crazy about her. The problem is she is probably infertile or at least has trouble conceiving that's why she is insecure and jealous of me. She tries to act civil but it's very clear she feels uncomfortable around me. I remember one incident when our son called us a family and she got visibly upset but tried to play it cool. Another time Matt's mother uploaded a picture of us 3, her and Matt's father her with the caption ""family"" and Sabrina got so upset that she made Matt confront his mom. She constantly calls Matt when he's spending time with us so you see she's a toxic woman. 
Recently she didn't come with us to Matt's mother's place and then called crying because she was scared about something which obviously was an act. So yeah she is kind of a toxic woman.A grown woman being so scared that she calls her husband crying?? Yeah right. And Matt went running to her. So I finally put my foot down and told Matt he needs to stop choosing her over us over and over again and I understand why she might be jealous of me but she can't keep getting away with this type of childish behavior he got mad and told he us doesn't want to hear a single word against her.

We're both in our 30s, so the plan had been to start trying for a baby right before our wedding. I wanted to delay that when the wedding was canceled since I didn't want her to be pregnant and unmarried, but she begged me to stick with the original plan due to our age and medical history and promised that if and when she got pregnant we'd have a civil ceremony. 

She got pregnant our first cycle but didn't want to have the ceremony right away. She said there was no rush. By August she had decided she instead wanted to do a small ceremony in December at her parents' house and didn't want a civil ceremony because she wanted our ceremony to be ""real."" Fine. 

\*\*\*Dispute:\*\*\* My fiancé's original dress won't work for our wedding in December because by then she'll be almost 30 weeks pregnant, so she had to find another that would work with her stomach. I haven't seen it, but when I asked her how it works, she told me it is form fitted.  I did ask her to clarify just to be sure I didn't have the wrong idea, and she told me that the dress isn't meant to hide her stomach. It is meant to compliment it.  

I am already uncomfortable with this situation, and I have family coming that are not happy with the way we've done things. I can deal with that, but I think this is too much. It's a bad look IMO that makes us look tacky. She, on the other hand, says it's fine and not a problem. 

\*\*\*Why I may be the asshole:\*\*\* I told her my thoughts and how I felt her flaunting her pregnancy while we're getting married would be a bad look. I said that wearing a dress like that would be tacky and begged her to choose something less form fitting. 

That really upset her, so now I am the asshole because I, in her words, am prioritizing the feelings of my family over her feelings and shaming her for being pregnant and treating her like an embarrassment. 

My intent wasn't to hurt her or make her feel like I am ashamed of her, but I want her to be reasonable and sensitive to the situation. I did offer to do a separate ceremony later after the baby is born, if we had eloped, but she declined; so I don't think she can say I didn't try to accommodate her and I don't feel like my ask is unreasonable given how flexible I've been until now.

We got married shortly after we graduated, settled down, and started a family. We have 3 kids (4M, 2F, and infant F). 3 kids under 5 is...hectic. Love my babies to pieces but I really wish we had spaced them out. 

I took a year off work when my youngest daughter was born. Quality childcare costs for 3 kids (especially a newborn) would've been nearly my entire paycheck. My oldest will start school next year so likely I'll go back to work then. 

I've been enjoying my time with the kids and been taking them to visit my family. My parents live half an hour away. I also have 2 sisters who live nearby with their families. We're constantly meeting up at my parent's house and spending time with the kids there.

My husband recently brought up that the kids should also see their paternal side, which I agree with. So I took them and we spent an afternoon. But then obviously we went back to our normal schedule (spending most days at my parent's house with my sisters & their kids). 

My husband said it was unfair that one side of the family is getting WAY more time with the grandkids. I said to him that, honestly, environment influences children and I think my family provides a better environment. They are all college graduates, working good jobs, do stuff like actually read books with their kids and it's not just constant chaos. 

Don't get me wrong, his family is a lot of fun but they're not role models. They don't have higher aspirations, only 1 college grad and that's my husband, and the kids are either watching TV or running around outside on the trampoline or the backyard. 

I definitely want my kids to see their dad's side often and I've made that happen because they're family and they're wonderful people. But as far as the role models my kids should be seeing during their formative years, shouldn't that be the side of the family that will push them to succeed?",2020-11-26 03:39:01,337,135,0.74,103,0,0,0,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She is 12 years old, and weighs 191 pounds. At 5'6"", I'm sure her BMI is high. She's never been gawky rail thin; I wasn't either as a kid, (I didn't pack on the pounds until college).



Her father and maternal grandmother are large people. Viking-like. My husband is overweight, but my mother in law is just big. Watches what she eats, works out daily. Tall, broad shoulders, wide hips.



Also, she had a hellacious growth spurt last year; grew five inches between 10 and 11.



I don't want to fat shame her. I don't want her to become anorexic or bulimic. I want her to be healthy. I don't want her to be bullied. I don't want her to struggle with her weight forever (once the ads find their mark, probably in the next year or two).



She won't go on walks with me, she won't join a sport in school. She's in anime club and choir.

She had a consultation with a surgeon, and to remove the skin it is going to be thousands of dollars that she’s going to have to pay out of pocket. 

When she told me this, I told her that I’m not okay with this. It’s a lot of money, and even though we both have a hefty savings, I don’t think it’s smart to drop that much money at once. 

She got a bit frustrated, and said that she feels extremely insecure and this is the only thing that will make her feel better about herself, and if I’m that worried then she can arrange paying the money back in installments.

I told her it’s not a good idea financially and that’s my final say, and if she decides to go through with the surgery then I’m going to be upset.

Our other daughter also got it (age 10) but survived thankfully. It was very hard on our family, honestly the grief is something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy and I never imagined losing my own child. 

I have been friends with Liz since 8th grade. We have always been very close and have always adored each other. 

We met up recently, both wearing our masks and social distancing. She started to complain about how she has gained weight during the quarantine, her kids gained some weight, are falling behind in school and don't leave her alone during the day, etc. I felt super uncomfortable, I didn't want to say anything at first but I was pissed.

It kind of just escalated, I put my mini backpack on and started to head out and she said ""Is every okay?"" and I said ""I don't know, I don't feel like hearing about how much you hate your kids while I had to bury my own"" to which she replied ""I'm just venting to you"" so I told her ""Liz shut the fuck up"" and left and cried in my car for a bit.

Listen, I know how stressful being a mother is. I am a mother of 4 (even though I lost one of them I will always have 4 children) 

It broke my heart to say something like that to a friend but it's been really upsetting seeing other friends posting stuff about how their kids have been bothering them during quarantine, even some making adoption jokes. Liz has so many other friends to vent to about her kids. But at the end of the day these parents will have zero idea what it's really like to lose a child and it's nothing fun at all, I would give anything to have my daughter back no matter how much stress she brought upon me.

Liz texted me back, saying she is sorry for making me feel bad but refused to apologize for venting about her children. I blocked her number. I asked another girl, Mia, who was part of our friend group in 8th grade if I was an AH and she said even if I am going through my own grieving period, I should allow my friend to rant to me (which is honestly ridiculous, I haven't responded to her and might block her)

I've been in a tough spot the past few days, in the back of my head I feel like I'm the AH.

My son and I had a rough few years. My wife had passed and it was very hard on him. Before her passing, we had a yearly thing where we would go to a local amusement park. It was sort of a father-son thing and my wife often didn't come along. We did plenty of other activities together as a family, but that was our special little thing.

With her passing and all, we didn't go the last two years but during that time I met a woman with a step daughter. For reference, my son is 10 and the daughter is 8. At first the new relationship was especially hard on my son, I always assured him that his mother will never be replaced, but to just think of it as an extended family.

I wanted to include my son as much as possible and I had the great idea of continuing our annual trips to the amusement park together to bring back some normalcy. Fortunately, it opened back up in limited capacity and I was able to get tickets.

When my step daughter heard we were going to the park, she begged to come along but I told her it was a father-son thing and we could always do something else together as a family later on. She cried and went through all the usual temper tantrums like ""it's not fair."" My wife yelled at me and told me to include her (she has to work so she can't come along). 

I think my wife is being totally unreasonable. This is just a way to bond with my son and it's something he expressed he wants to do together without his step-sister. Now obviously my son is my blood and I will definitely prioritize him over my step daughter, but I don't see the big deal in doing this with my son and spending time with my step daughter later on?",2020-11-02 15:29:52,519,1586,0.93,151,3,59,3,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
128,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/juxrfg/aita_for_defending_my_father_after_he_made_some/,AITA for defending my father after he made some comments about my wife breastfeeding but then apologized?,"So to be clear, I am NOT defending what he said. It was rude and I told that to him myself. What I am defending him on is the fact that he said it, apologized, my wife accepted, and then she followed up by sending a harsh message to him after the fact. My point to her, and where we disagree, is that after he apologized and she accepted that should have been the end of it. She says that what he said didn't fully register until after he'd apologized and she had more time to think about it, and she felt rushed into accepting his apology by both of us. That is why she did it without thinking.  

Now to the actual event. On Friday night my parents dropped by our house on short notice (literally as they were pulling up). We weren't really prepared for them but we let them in anyway. My wife was sitting in a chair in our living room breastfeeding our son when my dad walked in. He did not see anything other than my wife's boob (not nipple), but based on that he decided he had to comment so he told her that he could see why his grandson was so well fed. Then when my mom walked in he told her something like ""we don't have to worry about John starving by the looks of it."" My wife is very insecure about her body post-baby, so she was very upset and in tears.  

I told my dad that he owed my wife an apology and if he said more things like that to her he wouldn't be welcome in our home. My mom also called him out for this.  He quickly apologized and asked for her forgiveness. He also promised not to make comments like that again. 

My wife was still upset and not saying anything, and I did say to her that I thought my dad meant his apology and I hoped she could forgive him. I think this is what she means by saying she felt rushed. She said she accepted and he apologized again. Then my parents left. I thought that was the end of it because it seemed like we'd worked this out. 

I found out today that my wife sent my dad a message the next day raking him over the coals for what he said and telling him he was a pervert, disgusting and she didn't want him in her home again for a long time. My dad was definitely an asshole and probably deserved what she said, but I think it's an asshole move also to accept an apology and then bring the issue back up again, which is what I told her. I think she is entitled to say what she did but not after the fact and the issue was considered resolved. That is why I think she also crossed a line, although I think what she did was nothing close to being as bad as what he did. She was upset I defended him at all and said I was the asshole for not fully supporting her.

This was a time sensitive decision and after considering and having a few more heart to hearts with him, I told him to make arrangements for us to be in Philly together. 

I sat my daughter down and told her about the move. I said the school she was going to was a great school and she could always make more friends.

My wife, 26f wants to get a job so she has something to do. We have a small child who works need child care of she went to work, so I did all the math. I alone make too much to apply for subsidized childcare, and if she went out to get a job, the amount of would cost us for childcare would be more than she would make at the jobs she wants, so I told her if she wants the job she would have to figure out how to cover the deficit.

INFO

The deficit isn't as simple as ""oh we lose a little money ;-;"" it would be a significant amount, enough to make us over all struggle. I suppose saying ""I make good money"" was to broad a statement. I make enough to pay for our home, bills, groceries, insurances, vehicle, etc, while having enough money left over to do a few nice things, go to a movie, order food or go out to dinner, but I hardly make anything extravagant. 

Secondarily, a lot of people seem to think I have a problem with her getting a job at all, which is not the case? It's the math. When we first moved in with her, I told her she wouldn't need to work if she did not want too. If she wanted to, that was fine. We split the household accordingly. We had a kid, and she was still fine starting home. 

I have given her alternative options to make money and work that would allow us to not lose enough money every month that we would be scraping by each month but she refuses. I've asked her if she wants to go back to school to get a degree that would open her to to higher paying jobs, she just wants to go work at a, and I quote, Wendy's or a Walmart or something,"" so she refuses post secondary. 

To those of you saying ""your stay home and let her work,"" no? I am our financial foundation and the jobs she wants wouldn't give her the pay or the hours to support us. That's dumb. Cause if her job didn't work out we wouldn't be able to afford anything. Including our base bills

INFO 2
I've been messaged a few times by people suggesting I create a fund with the money I ""save"" on child care with her being the Sahm so if she wants a divorce she can leave without being worried about finances.

as part of a our marital agreement, since I am the primary income earner, I have a fund set aside so if she were to want a divorce she would be covered for 3 months rent, her basic needs met for a year, as well as child support. We even have a custody agreement, since I personally believe they are more important than a birth certificate stating we have 50/50 custody. Yes, you can get a custody agreement over a child even if you aren't splitting up. I suggest everyone gets one, because I don't want to deal with the stress of a custody battle, and I don't want our child to have to deal with the fallout of a custody battle. Same with divorce. It's entirely unnecessary.

When we got married, and when we had a kid, divorce and custody battle were possibilities that I wanted nothing more than too avoid. If they did happen however, I wanted it to be as easy as possible for everyone involved. I would rather have these things and not need them, then to not have them and need them.",2020-11-25 17:32:00,256,255,0.89,38,6,24,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know it isn't intentional from her side but it does annoy me anyway sometimes.

The last few weeks since we are sleeping in the same bed again, she usually falls asleep first and sleeps later. So I'm just laying on my phone and hear a lot of weird sleep comments. Some are making me uncomfortable. 

Examples:

""I don't want to have sex, you're gross"" (while touching me)

""Josh, you're so cute"" (my name is not Josh)

""Are you watching the baby"" (we don't have kids and don't want them)

""This cake tastes like puke"" (I have been baking for her recently)

It went on until she was 12, when the guy finally left my wife. Amanda has told me that this guy would emotionally abuse her and apparently gave her an eating disorder and insecurity issues. She would try to tell her mom all about this and she never did anything about it.

Recently, my wife got Amanda therapy after having some breakdowns. We got on the Zoom meeting, all three of us sat in front of the camera. Amanda told the therapist everything about the stuff she went through as a young child and how her mom put this guy before her. 

My wife was sobbing hearing all of this. It was well deserved but I instinctively started rubbing her shoulder and gave her a kiss. Amanda saw this on camera and freaked out and started screaming at me and said her mom deserved to feel like shit. And that her mom was only experiencing a small fraction of what she had to go through for 7 years.

Amanda came to me hours later to apologize for flipping out but said she still thinks I'm an AH for comforting her mom who has caused her so much pain.

I guess one of her friends was trying it and she wanted to see if it would work for her hair (it's wavy/curly). Since starting it, her hair is definitely way more curly and it does look nice.

However as we were talking about it she mentioned that she only washes her hair every 3-4 days and I  tried not to say anything but I definitely had a shocked look on my face so when she asked what was wrong I said I thought that was unhygenic. She said it's healtier for it and said it's not a big deal because ""it's not like her hair smells or anything"" which of course it's not going to smell bad when you're loading it up with a bunch of hair products every day.

On top of this I realized yesterday she doesn't even brush her hair anymore. She was cooking and I came up and rubbed her back a bit and my fingers ran through her hair a bit, she said ""ow"" and pulled back a bit and asked if I'd please be careful since it hurts when her hair is tugged on like that. I said sure, fine, don't want to cause her pain but I was also like ""What do you do when you need to brush it then?"" and she said she never brushes it, only uses a comb in the shower when her hair is wet. Meaning she only ever combs through it every 3-4 days. I was like ""what, are you trying to grow dreads??"" to which she just said ""That wouldn't even happen, I'm white"" which wasn't even my point but whatever. She was like ""what is wrong?"" and I said I just found it gross that she doesn't take basic care of her hair. She just laughed and said I didn't know what I was talking about so to not be a dick about it.

AITA? I don't think it's that ridiculous to be put off by someone not practicing regular hygeine but she is very proud of her hair lately.

EDIT: Thank you for your comments everyone, I accept I'm the AH here. I looked up the Curly Girl method some of you posted about and apologized to my girlfriend. She said that tomorrow after she washes her hair, I can watch her put the products in and see specifically how she mantains the hair, so I'm going to do that! All is well here again. :)

EDIT 2: Wow, this blew up. Again, I fully accept I was being an asshole and I completely understand why. To give some more context (with the permission of my gf), my gf also lives with bipolar type 2 and in the past, changes in hygiene have always been an indicator of a mood swing. Obviously that wasn't the case this time around but after talking it through i realized that this past experience is part of what informed my own concern. Obviously that doesn't excuse my judginess, but I was just glad that after talking it through I was able to figure out for myself what was actually poking at me--not the hair, but rather me worrying that something else was going on. I'm really glad I know about the CGM now, and I'm actually really excited for my gf to show me her routine tomorrow! Also, my gf is having a fun time reading through the comments and we're both laughing about how much of an ass i was about this. She also now wants to make a reddit account to join the curly girl subreddit, so thank you to everyone who suggested that!

I M33 been married to my wife for over three years. And I absolutely hated my (now) deceased mother in law for a number of reasons.

She hated me for no good reason and treated me horribly over the years. She insulted my family/my degree/my home constantly. She called me all kinds of bad names and was able to get the whole family convinced that I was some kind of a narcissistic,greedy asshole who only married her daughter for her money. I've endured years of being disrespected/belittled and being kicked out and told to never come back. All while she was dealing with cancer which my wife used as excuse to defend her and she never ever backed me up not even once. I was told to suck it up and keep my mouth shut.

Mother in law lost her battle with cancer last week. My wife spent the majority of her time with her since her golden child didn't bother to visit and take care of his mother.

My wife was with her when she passed away. My wife then came home and told me that her mom just died while I was in the kitchen. I looked at my wife and said “oh. Well...” my wife stared at me shocked. I could see she was crying because her face was red. She yelled at me asking me how i could be this cold towards a tragedy and that she just lost her mom. She kept yelling at me and started crying and calling me names.

She left after that and stayed there with her family and refused to come home after the funeral.

Made her cry.,"So my girlfriend made a handmade ravens blanket for me and has been working on it for about the past month. She also got me a matching teddybear. 
Her gifts are so embarrassing to me. I am a 29 year old man and do not need a blanket nor a teddybear. I told her that it was embarrassing and that she should know what I like and should stick to sportswear. Now she won't really talk to me because she said that I didn't appreciate her. The blanket is actually really nicely made and of my favorite football team but it's so embarrassing to have as a man. Should I just toss them out or donate them?

I want children, he's unsure. Not the case when we got married: both wanted around 3 children (I'm willing to bring it down to 1 now). We argue about this a lot, but have a pretty good marriage overall. Recently, something major happened with my family (health scare) and I realized that my husband is not capable of providing the physical or emotional support that it may take to raise a child. He's lazy and has a tendency to get touchy, but I'm okay with that up until a point. Not only do I not want to change him if he doesn't want to, but I also don't want him to regret making a major decision just to make me happy, or walk out on our child. I'm pretty stable and will be sad if we ended, but I'm okay to do what it takes to build the family I want.

He does has some abandonment issues as a result of his parents basically walking out on him as a child and we did move really fast in our relationship (house, car, marriage, etc.). So, he's a little overwhelmed and confused about whether he wants more responsibilities. We are working on things with a therapist, but she anticipates it will take years before he feels secure enough to have children given his reluctance to admit such problems. WIBTA if I told him I want to have a baby within 2 years but if he doesn't want to, we should go our separate ways?

Tl;dr: Want a baby, husband unsure. Should I give him an ultimatum?

&#x200B;

Update: Thank you, I've decided against the ultimatum.

I think I didn't explain it well enough in my original post, but he has not ever said that he does NOT want kids, just not sure anymore. We did and do communicate about this, just often times it ends in frustration. We diligently go to couples therapy each week because of this change of mind (and other things) and our therapist has struggled to get a straight answer out of him. Its not that he's this horrible human being that is incapable of being a father...it's just that he shows selfish tendencies like how I probably did at 20, except that he's 41 y/o...

It's not that I saw and realized he was this emotionally broken man and decided to take advantage of it. We both have our traumas and he carries himself well and felt that he addressed everything earlier in his life - which is why he said he was ready to marry and have children with me. We did discuss it thoroughly, including which parental techniques we would use. So, yes, it's been difficult and shocking, but I love him very much. I have mentioned that I would let him take some time to figure it out, but I don't know when that time should be up. We've also agreed that if he decides no, that we will divorce, but I'm afraid it's enabled him to hang in ""maybe"" for too long.

Anyways, I haven't decided what to do. I do love and care for him and worry most of all because I am the main breadwinner, but I will not simply walk out on him. I think we may need to part ways, which is why I want to be sure that I am not having isolated and bias thoughts. That's it - I still find reading all your comments very helpful.",2020-11-22 22:07:21,189,502,0.92,22,9,10,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I spent countless of hours preparing her birthday (Contacting her friends, blowing balloons, decorating house) only to be heavily criticised by my husband and relatives in the end. Let me explain what happened.

&#x200B;

I was responsible for purchasing the cake for my now 10 year old daughter. My daughter isn’t a big fan of chocolate cake especially if it contains walnuts and instead  wanted a simple strawberry cake with vanilla frosting. Guys, who eats such a cake? I am aware we don’t have to have the same preferences, but I can guarantee you that NO ONE I KNOW is a fan of strawberry cake EXCEPT her. I couldn’t let all the guests disappointed with the cake only because she wants strawberry cake, I had to think about the majority (and I’ll admit, I am crazy over chocolate) so instead I went with walnuts chocolate cake and politely asked the baker if she could add some strawberries on the top for my daughter.

&#x200B;

I didn’t really have the time to tell her that I didn’t get her the cake she wanted so she was really excited to eat the cake and asked us to start singing happy birthday 2 hours before the time we were supposed to. When she saw the cake she was really disappointed. She started screaming and crying. I whispered and begged her to stop because the guests were looking but she wasn’t stopping and I got so embarrassed. She ended up not eating the cake anymore and the guests left earlier than usual because my daughter was really upset over the cake and couldn’t get over it.

&#x200B;

I had a huge argument with my husband over this. Guys, don’t get me wrong, while I was aware she wasn’t a big fan of the cake, I had NO IDEA it was going to turn out like this. If I had known this I would have just bought her the strawberry cake. AITA here?

EDIT: Please stop cursing me in the comments and DM'S or else I will remain inactive in this forum. Thank you.",2020-10-10 10:06:55,1719,2061,0.8,182,0,0,0,,,1,,,,,1,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They're usually triggered by external stimuli, especially if it's related to my C-PTSD, but they can also happen seemingly out of nowhere. I was abused repeatedly as a child, and am still dealing with the fallout in adulthood.

Fast forward to last weekend. My GF's cousin (let's call her Susan) was getting married, and invited me to come to the wedding as a +1. It was a very small, intimate ceremony, but relatively safe given COVID restrictions. I'd already been feeling on edge earlier that morning after an argument with my dad, but decided to come anyway thinking being with my GF's family would help get my mind off things. Sadly, this ""on edge"" feeling didn't go away. I tried to ""hold in"" my anxiety to keep the peace, but it wasn't working. My GF tried calming me down, holding my hand and assuring me everything was ok. After a few minutes, I got up during the vows, and headed for the lobby to try and calm down. My GF got up with me. A few people stared at us as we left. After a while, I did feel better, and some relatives asked me if I was all right. It felt nice knowing these total strangers weren't going to judge me for a mental health crisis that I couldn't control.

Later that day, I was at my GF's apartment. While she was in the bathroom, her phone went off, revealing a string of texts from Susan. I didn't snoop through her phone; texts on iPhones appear briefly for a few seconds while on sleep mode. Due to post length rules, I'll give a brief summary. Susan thanked my GF for coming to her wedding, but added that it was very rude to just get up and leave in the middle of the ceremony. Susan said she worked her butt off to make the wedding happen in spite of COVID, my GF and I took attention away from her, and that I should've stayed home. I later told my GF about the texts, and she apologized profusely for Susan's behavior. She said she never remembered her cousin acting like this, and maybe she was just caught up in the heat of the wedding. I'm sure that's true, but Susan's not the first person bothered by my panic attacks, and she won't be the last.

Maybe I should've stayed home. I was already feeling panicky to begin with, but I left anyway because I love being around my GF and her family. Maybe it was selfish of me to do this on such a special occasion as a wedding. AITA?

Edit: I don't think I made a big scene or anything. I had some staggered breathing, tremors, and felt lightheaded. There were about 12-15 people in the audience.

Edit 2: I now see that ITA here,  but thanks for also being understanding of my disorder. I hope Susan will accept my apology. I never meant to ruin the wedding, but I shouldn't have used it as a way to make myself feel better. I should've stayed home, and found someone else to talk through my panic attack. I just thought my GF would've been the best person ATM.",2020-11-09 23:18:57,273,1315,0.94,69,7,34,2,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of my  bridesmaids, June, is pretty much the opposite of me. Shes very reserved whereas I am a party type gal--love going out to clubs with my fiance! Anyways, for my Bachelorette party, I wanted to go hire male strippers. Everyone thought it was a great idea...except June.

June said she was happy I was happy, but she wouldn't be attending that type of event. I asked her why, I made sure to plan it on a day everyone could come. She said it wasn't something she was comfortable with. I got upset and told her its not about her comfort, its about attending to support me.

She told me she would be very upset if her husband attended a party with strippers and so she woule never even ask to do the same. It would be ""hypocritical"" of her to hold him to those standards but expect to be able to do what she wanted just bc it was my Bachelorette. June told me she'd be happy to attend once they left but there was no way she'd disrespect her husband like that. She also said that even if he wasn't in the picture, shes not comfortable with it.

I got very upset and told her she was a bad friend for completely refusing to even ask her husband or to put aside her goody-two-shoes attitude for one night thats for ME, NOT her or her husband.

Aita for getting mad?

**Edit: Alright guys, I get it, Im a major asshole. I really didn't expect it to blow up this much. June ended up seeing it, I didn't know she had reddit. It hasn't gone well.

And it got brought up again today as we had a zoom meeting to celebrate my daughter's 18th birthday. 

My daughter, 16 at the time, and my niece went out to eat and listen to a live band at an Irish.
She was very exited because she only gets to see her cousin (21 at the time) every 2 or 3 years.

When I came home that afternoon my niece and daughter were upstairs getting ready. Now as a rule I don't allow my daughter to put on too much make up. Mascara and lipbalm is fine but not more. I just want her to have a normal childhood and not grow up too fast.

When she came down I was kind of shocked. She had on eyeshadow, eyeliner and mascara. It was very noticeable. At the time I didn't say much but I made a passive aggressive comment I have to admit.

When they left I called my nices mother and told her. My sister was just like ""relax"". But I don't agree. I don't want my daughter walking around like a slut.

When they came back I pulled my niece aside and basically reprimanded her and told her she would be barred from my place if she didn't respect my rules and forced things on my daughter that were not age apropriate. My niece basically said that she only did what my daughter asked her for and that she is 16. As long as she doesn't walk around naked, make up is her personal choice. I called her an Uber and told her she would be welcomed back as soon as she apologized to us.

My sister had been cold since then and my daughter has also been very pissed because I didn't let her cousin come over for the rest of her trip.

I won't be too specific, but it has to do with the effect of IT/technology and gamification on education and...    
    
It's just so stupid!    
    
We've talked about this for years, and I've always made it clear that I found gamification and (to an extent) the overuse of technology in educational settings to be detrimental to the entire ordeal. Not only have I struggled to find any (in my opinion) credible academic literature to support the subject, but having been a teacher for just shy of a decade, I've never seen a practical approach with those two elements that didn't crash and burn or, at the very least, only produced results similar to lesson plans without them present.    
    
Well, now that he's been accepted, he's really excited. In his own words, he was ""stuck"" in IT jobs (development, not support) for years, and he missed the human element of interviewing people and for his work to have a real impact on society besides adding to the bottomline of corporations.    
    
I can respect that, but since it's all he wants to talk about, and two night ago, we had some wine with dinner, and a few more after, and when he started talking about it again, I just couldn't. I snapped and told him to STFU with his pseudoscience.    
    
Well, the mood was ruined, and so was the weekend. He's barely spoken to me today, but his best friend reached out and asked if I actually said that. I was honest, and explained why, and all he could say was ""Wow""    
    
Just to be clear, I don't think I'm the asshole for expressing my view on his forthcoming research, but am I the asshole for the way I expressed it?

While none of us are star athletes, Sophie, Lucy, and I are more fit while Austin is on the heavier side. He also has mild asthma. 

A few weeks ago, the four of us went hiking. The trail was steep but Sophie, Lucy, and I were able to make it up without too many issues. However, we had to stop several times so Austin could catch his breath. At one point he told us to keep going without him and he’d meet us when we came back down the mountain. We kept encouraging him and he did make it to the top after some struggles. 

Sophie recently got asked on a hiking date and wanted to make sure she was prepared so she texted Lucy and I asking if we’d like to go hiking with her. She made it clear that she didn’t want to invite Austin as she wanted to be able to take a challenging trail without him slowing us down. Lucy and I agreed to hike with her. 

We had a lovely hike with nice views. I snapped a picture at one point and without thinking I posted it on my snapchat story. When I got home I noticed I had a message from Austin asking where I’d been. I told him I’d gone for a hike with Sophie and Lucy. He responded “Where was my invite?” I said that Sophie had texted Lucy and I and it had been a fairly last minute thing. He didn’t respond after that and I assumed he was done with the situation. 

The next day the four of us were hanging out together when Austin made a passive aggressive comment about how he “hoped we enjoyed yesterday’s hike without him.” Here’s where I think I may be TA: I stepped in immediately and told him the reason we didn’t invite him is because on the last hike he slowed us down a lot and we wanted to be able to be able to challenge ourselves. He seemed pretty upset and left. Lucy agrees with me while Sophie says I could’ve found a nicer way to phrase it. Did I go to far?

Edit: in a short amount of time this has already gathered a fair bit of attention. I accept that I am TA and I am going to apologize to Austin

Edit #2: I’m seeing a lot of comments of “Austin would’ve known it was too much for him and said no” but he is the type who wants to be part of everything and wouldn’t sit it out. We didn’t want to abandon him somewhere on the mountain. I am absolutely open to hiking with him in the future and beginning with some less challenging trails to help him build his stamina.

They have a tiny basement suite with a bedroom/bathroom that is kind of separate where I stay. We share common areas but I pay 200/month rent and help with chores, and we mostly stay out of each other's hair. 

My sister (25F) and her husband (27M) needed a place to stay in between moves so they've been in my parents guest room for 4 months. They were planning to move into their new place Dec 1

I do freelance work online, but my sister and parents physically go to work every day. My sister's husband recently lost his job so he is home too. We got to know each other a lot better with some one on one conversation and really got along. I honestly never spent much time with him before and it was super fun to hang out a bit and not feel so isolated all the time (not much, just having lunch in the kitchen together and occasionally watching a TV show on a break)

2 weeks ago I had a day off but everyone else was at work. My sister's husband said he had weed brownies and asked if I wanted to spend an afternoon being high and watching movies and I was curious as someone who doesn't try weed much so I agreed. We also had a few drinks. 

I feel like I got confused, but one thing led to another and we ended up having sex. It happened so fast and I didn't realize how awful it was until afterwards and told him that could never happen again and we have to stop hanging out. He agreed easily.

I guess he felt guilty because he ended up telling my sister, and she told our parents. Everyone is freaking out. My mom told me yesterday she wants me to move out, even though my sister decided she doesn't want to move with her husband anymore. I tried explaining so much but nobody will let me get my thoughts out - they just want me to leave.

I pay rent, so they can't kick me out over a personal issue. I accept that I did something wrong but I need time to set something up at least. And think they should at least listen to my apology even if not accept it.

I fucked up, and I will leave. I think my sister is going to take over the suite. Her husband already left somewhere. I don't have enough savings to just go immediately so I said I'm staying until things are easier for moving.

Nobody is talking to me now. I know I'm an AH for sleeping with my sister's husband, but am I also an AH for refusing to leave so suddenly?

I’ve been ordering pizza from them for years. Sadly, I know they are hanging on by a thread because of the pandemic, so I try to support them by giving in to my pizza cravings more often, tipping the driver more, ordering more add-ons, etc. Nothing extraordinary, just rooting for them to survive this thing. They appear on Grubhub, but they do all of their own deliveries.

A friend of mine left town for Thanksgiving (yeah, irresponsible, but not relevant for this post), so yesterday I was at her house to look in on her pets (cat and turtles). The cat seemed lonely, so I figured I’d order a pizza and chill with him for a while. I couldn’t order on Grubhub because my friend’s house is a couple of blocks outside the restaurant’s standard delivery area (less than half a mile). I called and told the employee that I understood I was slightly outside their delivery area but I’d be happy to pay ANY extra delivery fee they wanted and would tip the driver 30%. The employee pretty much said, “No, sorry, you’re outside our delivery area, bye” and hung up.

I’m pretty positive they weren’t busy (Tuesday afternoon during a pandemic), I literally told the employee that I’d pay extra AND tip 30%, and this is a casual family-owned pizza joint, not some corporate franchise with rigid, unbendable policies. I understand why the employee said no, but I also kinda feel like the owner should know what happened, so he can decide if he wants to train the staff to handle that kind of thing differently in the future. At least until he’s sure they’re going to survive the pandemic.

To be 100% clear, my goal isn’t to complain or be a “Karen”. It’s not even a complaint & I'll absolutely remain as loyal a customer as I've always been! I totally understand that the employee did not do ANYTHING wrong, and I'd never dream of telling the owner if the place weren't struggling so badly. I just think if I were the owner, I’d want a heads-up if my staff were turning down good business when the shop is SO close to shutting down, just to avoid driving a few extra blocks. That said, I feel like an AH to snitch on some random employee who’s probably making minimum wage, surely under enough stress, just trying to get through his shift. And maybe it would be wrong of me to encourage a business owner to push his employees to do more work than they signed up for. I’m really torn.

Earlier this year I got married to my then boyfriend of two years, who I'll call Oli. He's 34 and already has two kids, a boy and a daughter.

We moved in together in January. I had to move away from my hometown because Oli got a new job. I was a little unhappy about moving away, so to appease me Oli told me I could choose the house and decorate it.

I found this magnificent house and we moved in, along with his kids, who split their time between our house and their mom's. Since January I've been decorating and it looks gorgeous. 

Everything was going pretty well until earlier this week. When the kids came back from the weekend at their mom's, Oli's daughter, who is 11, was carrying a huge box. It was so big and heavy that she needed her older brother and Oli to help get it into the house. I asked her what was in it, and then she opened it and I saw that it was full of her pottery projects from the last five or so years of school.

I asked why she had brought them all, and she said that her mother told her to bring them because her mother is moving to a smaller apartment and so doesn't have room. I thought it was sort of odd but whatever. I asked her if she wanted me to help carry them into the basement or the attic. She said that no, she was going to put them in her room, so I helped bring them upstairs. She asked if she could leave her newest project downstairs to show it off. It looked alright so I let her put it somewhere out of the way that didn't clash too much with the decor.

Well, I guess she sent her mom a picture, because later that day her mom called me. She said that she wanted me to put up the rest of the pottery pieces around the house to show them off. I was sort of weirded out because we barely talk. I told her that and I explained how they didn't fit into the decor, so I would rather not. At no point did my step daughter ask to put any of the others up.

When Oli came home from work, he told me that his ex had called him to complain about not putting the pottery up. He asked me to just find places to put the rest up, because he was proud of how good they were. Honestly they were pretty terrible, so I told him no again, and I reminded him of how he promised I could decorate the house alone.

This devolved into a fight in which we both called each other some hurtful things. Now we're not talking. I guess I could put up the rest of the pottery, but it's more the principle of the thing that bothers me. I don't appreciate my husband's ex wife trying to come into my house and tell me how to decorate. Oli also promised me I would decorate and no one else, so I think it's unfair to renege on that promise. I don't want to be the evil stepmother, but I also refuse to be stepped on in my own house.

I (34M) don’t think I’m the asshole, but my mom said I’m lucky my wife (32F) didn’t crack me over the head with a frying pan, and my friend said I was being a dipshit.

Thanksgiving is a big deal in my family. My wife is a pediatric nurse on a cancer ward, and works every other year and it’s 12 hour shifts, so even if she does stop by, it’s somewhat late. This year it’s her year to work. My dad mentioned to me over the weekend that they found it disrespectful that she only came every other year. I reminded him she was a nurse, but he said she knew how important Thanksgiving was to our family and how she should work something out because our traditions are her traditions now. I agreed with that.

I mentioned trying to get every Thanksgiving off to my wife and she said it didn’t work that way schedule wise, and that even if she could get this year off, that would mean she’d have to give up Christmas and that’s the holiday that’s a big deal in her family. I told her that since she married me my families traditions should be more important to her. She got pretty aggravated at that, and walked away from me.

I called to tell my parents and my mom flipped out. Apparently, only my dad thinks that and my mom thinks I should go grovel for forgiveness for suggesting “such stupidity”. The thing is, I do kinda agree with my dad. My mom called my wife to apologize for our behavior and let her know she’d save her a plate if she wanted to stop by after work. I’m aggravated at my mom, and feel like she should have butt out because I don’t think this is an unreasonable request. So, AITA for wanting my wife to prioritize my family traditions?

However, he is not my 21 year old daughter’s father.

My daughter’s father died right after she was born. Because his parents were very well off, they wanted to make sure that my daughter was never going to go want for anything. 

Therefore, they set up a trust fund that would essentially give her $6,000 a month starting when she was 18 and would continue until she was 50. 

However I raised my daughter with the understanding that she should go to college and get a paying job after. 

My daughter took two gap years so this is her freshman year of college.

For her college, if you opted to be on campus, you had to pay for on campus housing as a freshman but they can’t force you to stay in it if you don’t want to.

We moved my daughter in, and she texted me a week later saying the dorm absolutely sucks. 

That the lighting is awful, the room is small, the building is old- she can see a lot of places where there are rust in the bathrooms, and her neighbors complain about her guitar playing even though she feels most creative later at night.

She said it was pretty hard to function in the dorms and asked that she be allowed to move to an off campus apartment. I took a look at the pictures she sent of the apartment she wanted to live in and thought it was beautiful. 

All modern amenities, contemporary decor, and a pretty large space. 

Because she’s in the city, one bedrooms run from $2,900 up. 

My husband said all her complaints were pretty ridiculous and that part of college is learning how to live with a community of people.

He also said that I should not pay for this apartment and that if she really wanted to move out of a habitable accommodation she should do it with her own money.

I work as well and have separate accounts from my husband. My stance was that the money from her grandma shouldn’t be used to pay for basic necessities. 

She buys most of her clothes and pays for her activities through her trust, and I don’t want her to have to worry about any college costs, since I promised to cover everything regarding her education.

So I ended up co-signing a lease to the apartment and paid for movers to bring her stuff from the dorm to her new apartment.

My husband said that was inappropriate and I should have asked him. I told him this was my daughter and it wasn’t up to him to determine what constituted spoiled and what didn’t.

She was and is extremely intelligent. She's practically a human calculator as well as being able to speak several languages fluently. Her talents came out when she was very young and she did extremely well academically, passing all her exams early and even getting university offers in her early teens. Her parents put a huge amount of pressure on her. They forced her to study constantly and refused to let her see any of her friends or even leave the house at all during some periods. 

Liz eventually ran away from home and lived with a friend's family. Unfortunately the scars from her childhood still affect her. With her mind and her academic achievements, she could do anything she wants. Instead she works at the checkout in a shop. She only ever wears plain clothes and never wears jewellery or makeup. Obviously it isn't my place to tell her what to wear, but Liz actively doesn't want to stand out. She wants to blend in and be as average as possible, the opposite of what her parents wanted. 

We have a daughter, Claire, who is 18, and we were both adamant that she would get a normal childhood. She's got her mother's talents. From her early school years she was always top of the class. Her teachers even offered her to move up a couple of years because she's so advanced, but she turned it down to stay with her friends, which we respected. 

Claire is a very outgoing person. She loves going to parties and spending time with her friends, and is a happy, bubbly kid. She's still a high achiever and has applied to an elite university to study mathematics. 

Like many girls her age Claire is into fashion and clothes and shoes etc. Yesterday she asked Liz for money to buy some new stuff, which resulted in an argument between them when Liz said she's asking too often (she bought a few dresses last week). 

Later Liz was still annoyed, saying that Claire takes everything for granted and that she doesn't understand how comfortable her childhood has been. I asked Liz if she was sure she wasn't jealous of Claire and if she doesn't wish she had the life we've given her. 

Liz got extremely upset and asked how I could say that to her. She stormed off, and when I went to bed, she was crying and told me she wanted to be alone.

Apartment prices where we live are not the best for what you get. Sam has been wanting a new bed for years especially over the last 18 months or so since the wooden slats on her bed keep falling off or breaking. Sam has told me she's fed up off having to mend her bed at 3am and waking up with a bad back, because I refuse to allow her to get a new bed.

I never allowed her to get a new bed because her room was a mess, i always told her if she'd clean up her room, i'd look into getting her new slats for her bed.

So this week Sam has cleaned her room completely moved some things around and when i questioned her, she said she's woke up one to many times with a broken bed and wants to at least get her bed fixed. She also mentioned at around the same time, that her boyfriend had bought her a big present. that she didn't know what he had bought her just that it was the anniversary, birthday and Christmas gift combined.

So today, she was on edge always looking for the delivery of the present, i went out to work and about an hour after i left, she called and said that the present her boyfriend got her was a bed and it's not a cheap one either. I was honestly expecting another single bed but was really annoyed to find a massive double bed taking up most of my front room. (I told her to leave it in the packaging until i got home)

I mentioned to her that a bed was a weird gift, especially since he's never seen the her room before. and asked her if she bought it, which she obviously denied, told me i can check her bank statments and call her boyfriend if I want to check out her story. I expressed concern on whether it would fit in her room and told her we might have to completely rearrange her room again. Sam just looked at me as if i was stupid and reminded me of the plans she had to move some of the shelves, in theory her plan works but i'm not 100% sold.

when we went back down stairs, i asked Sam again if she had bought it and again she said no. I told her having a double bed is something couples have and she was livid. Apparently her friends had double beds in highschool, to which i replied they had bigger houses, which according to Sam is not the point and I should get rid of my King size bed according to my logic since I'm single. Sam has called me an asshole because i've replaced my bed twice in the last 10 years, but she's been stuck with her childhood bed.

I resell jordans, so I recognized them. I was kind of surprised that he would be skating in shoes going upwards of 2,000 dollars. 

So I went up to him and asked him if he would be willing to sell them because they were still in really good condition. (Estimated he wore them max 3 times) He said something like “are you sure u want these bro, I’ve skated in them and shit”. I told him yea and asked him how much he wanted. At this point, I realized for sure that he didn’t know how much they were worth because he said “well I paid retail on them which was like 190, so how about 140 since I wore them a couple times”. I countered at 110$ and we ended up meeting at 125$. I wanted to make sure they were authentic so i Legit checked them then gave the kid the money.

I recorded the whole exchange and posted it(kids identify was not revealed and he said I could) and while most people thought it was funny, some are saying I took advantage of the kid and I’m an asshole. To me, that really doesn’t make any sense because we  both agreed to the sale. Everyone should know the value of what they are wearing. It’s common sense. 

But here’s where the problem is. The video blew up and he saw it and contacted me saying he wants to “trade back”. The thing is I already cleaned the shoes up and am planning on selling them tomorrow. (Not for the full amount since he didn’t have the box/extra laces, but for a very good price). I told him all trades are final, and that’s where some people are saying I’m an asshole if I don’t give them back. So AITA?

I have considered not telling her and just letting things play out on Christmas for a few reasons. I know our son will love it, and the ATV my parents bought is not that powerful so I don't have any real concerns about him getting hurt. I know my dad will watch him like a hawk, so I view it as unlikely he would ever get more than a scrap or bruise at this level.

My brother has a developmental disability and for whatever reason that makes him very socially awkward. When we were growing up he was just sort of there, and never shared anything with us.

So I don’t really ever know how to interact with him and my kids really don’t. He lives alone though and chooses to have no friends so I make sure to invite him to as much as possible.

And so as I was planning this festivity I told my kids that he would be there and they started to complain about how he’s weird and how he gets uncomfortable when they hug him and stuff like that.

I told them it was very rude that they’d think this way about someone different than them and they would perhaps should spend the whole day with him if they can’t be nice.

Well they gave up after that. We had a nice event and my brother seemed to have fun and my kids didn’t say much when he randomly left during conversations or when he didn’t get jokes, or even when he panicked when someone sat in his seat. I was really proud of my kids. 


After the event my oldest child came to me and said it was pretty bitchy to tell us we should be nice to someone who I considered a punishment to be around. 

My sister was still there and I asked her about it and she said that it wasn’t bad at all because he’s both family and truthfully quite painful to be around with his whines and staring and such.

Jake has a big, embracing family to say the least. His grandparents bought us the house that we’re living in, and since my oldest son’s dad isn’t in his life, Jake has completely stepped up.

Since the holidays are coming up and my mother won't be here to cook for the family this year, my wife has asked me to share my mom's recipes with her so she can make them. She loves to cook and would like to carry on my mom's traditions. I cook as well and had planned to take over the responsibilities myself, so I told her that there was no need for her to take over. She still wanted to help, but I told her that I could manage by myself. This led to an argument and eventually I had to admit that part of my reason for not sharing the recipes with her is to honor my mom's request.

She thinks I am being ridiculous by not sharing them with her, but my mom never gave her any of her recipes. If she wanted to share them, she would have.

Fast forward a little less than a year later, and we're ultimately in love and want to get married. I buy her a ring, we get engaged, and Covid really started to get going. So in September we decided to not wait any longer and just have a small wedding without a ceremony, only my and her parents. The word gets out, and somehow my friend gets the news without us telling him. He went nuts and debated our yearlong friendship, I'll spare you the details.

Me and wife think we did the right thing by not hurting his feelings, and as he's on the other side of the world it should be none of his concern anyway. I know it's a hard thing for him to deal with, but that's just life.

We rarely fight and we have a lot of trust for each other. She and I are going to married in a couple of months. We have an inside joke together that we’re allowed to fuck whoever we want the night before our wedding. We are both very aware it’s a joke and it’s not something we really want to try. 

We haven’t said actual names during the joke, yet but she was curious. She said she knows exactly who she would fuck. I asked her who, she said I’d have to tell her mine first. To be honest I had never really thought about who. But when she asked the first person that came to mind was her sister who is 5 years younger than her. I know this is probably fucked up. I rationalized by thing that since her sister looks like a younger version of her,  it’s like I’d just want to cheat on my fiancée with my fiancée when we first met.

I didn’t say, and said I didn’t really know. She didn’t believe me for a second and kept asking. At one point she jokingly said, “Who knows? I might be able to hook you up with her”.  I guess she could tell on my face that I felt bad about who I thought. She said it’s okay because it’s just a joke and she wouldn’t be mad. I against my better judgement blurted out her sisters name. She stopped smiling and asked me, “What the fuck did you just say?” I went into panic mode and said the name of a celebrity, that didn’t help the situation.

Our other two were also conceived quickly. The first was conceived in our second cycle of trying and the second in our first. This child was also conceived in our first cycle of trying. It's honestly shocking given how many couples we know that were past six months when they finally conceived. 

I don't want to seem ungrateful, because I know many couples would be thrilled with our luck, but I feel like we (or at least I) missed out on the fun part of trying to conceive since it happened so quickly and then everything shifted into pregnancy/baby mode. In addition, typically there's been no boost to my wife's sex drive during pregnancy, so we didn't even get to experience that. I wouldn't change anything if I could just so we're clear, but I am still disappointed that we didn't get to have more carefree sex. 

Ever since my wife told me she was pregnant again, I haven't been able to stop thinking about this and my disappointment. I've tried to avoid it and not dwell on it, but evidently I didn't do a good job of either because it's still there and I can't help but feel that I missed out. It may be worse this time because I know that the door is closed now and that's it. 

My wife could tell I was ""off"" and kept pressing. I didn't want to admit what was bothering me because I felt like she'd think I was being petty, but after she started to worry that I might not want the baby I told the truth. It helped but she still was upset, as I expected. She said that this was an incredibly selfish view to have because it was me prioritizing sex over her well being (i.e. TTC is stressful for her so I was in a way willing to trade her mental wellbeing for pleasure).

I don't agree with that view at all. In fact, I think it's a pretty ridiculous way to look at the situation and probably is the most negative take on my feelings. I'm saying ideally we could have had more carefree sex and enjoyed this experience more, which also includes no stress or anxiety. I would never trade pleasure for her mental health, so I'm surprised that she really thinks I would do that if given the choice. I just think she's taken my feelings completely out of context and has unfairly labeled me the asshole.

Back in August, I took my girlfriend engagement ring shopping. After a couple of stores, we found the perfect one—we both really love it and it’ll be the ring I eventually buy for her. We’ve been talking more seriously about getting engaged since June. 

A few weeks after we picked out the ring (I haven’t bought it yet), she asked me if I knew when I was going to propose. I said that I hadn’t given the timeline a ton of thought, which was the truth. She was upset about that and told me that it was unfair for me to get her hopes up by going ring shopping, but she dropped it after I told her I’d propose “soon.” Fast forward to last week, she asked me again, and I told her I wasn’t sure when. She wasn’t happy with that answer. She again said that I had gotten her hopes up and it was unfair to shop for a ring if I wasn’t going to propose soon or if I didn’t have a plan.

I love my girlfriend. She’s amazing and I could go on for days about how lucky I am to have her. I am going to propose to her one day, I’m just don’t know when. She is uncomfortable with not knowing when things will happen in her life so I’m not exactly surprised by her response. We’ve had the same argument about her moving in (she’s been staying with me pretty much exclusively since August, but I haven’t asked her to officially move in yet, so she still has her place). I want her to live with me, it be been going well so far, I just don’t have a timeline in my head if when she should officially move in. She’s on a month by month lease so it’s not like we need to really plan anything out as long as we give her landlord 30 days notice. 

I was talking to my friend and his wife about this and they think I’m being unfair. But I’m just not the kind of person to make plans ahead of time. In my mind, when it’s the right time to propose, I’ll just know and then it’ll happen. I don’t feel like I should have to plan out a timeline. My girlfriend says that she feels like I’m leaving her hanging off a cliff and that it’s hard for her to have this much uncertainty. I think she’s being a bit insecure.",2020-11-23 14:57:23,170,339,0.92,96,4,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My friend thinks so.,"I'm the child of  immigrants that has lived his entire life in the US  so I've always been one of those bilingual and bicultural kids. Recently I've started to appreciate the privileges presented to you when  you're from an immigrant family. The biggest one by far is that your world is much bigger than that of other people's. I have both US and EU citizenship which is basically most of the developed world and I have all the sweet benefits offered to the citizens of both places.

I will graduate college in May 2021 but I've been dreading the thought of paying off my student loans for a while now. However, I found a pretty sweet loophole which is only available for people in my shoes; I can simply emigrate from the US to Europe, ""pay off"" my loans through IBR (aka- legally not pay anything), and just enjoy life in Europe. My plan is both legitimate and legal.

When I told my plans to my college friend he thought I was joking and then he got mad at me when he realized that I'm serious. He basically said that my actions are unfair to those who can't leave America and have to live with their loans for decades. Although he's more progressive than me politically he said I will be a burden on American taxpayers who will have to pay for me and other people from immigrant families who take advantage of the good things America offers and then go back when it is time to return the favor.

So my friend basically that that I'm using my ""child of immigrants"" privilege to work my way around the system, but I feel like what I'm doing is totally legitimate. It's not like the entire student loans crisis is the fault of people like me. It's the fault of the system which encourages young people to make financially life altering decisions at an age when they should only be focused on their education. Ever since I was young it was pumped into me that I need to go to college to have a chance at having a good life. So I went to college, I'll soon get my degree, and I will now do what I must to have that good life.

Edit: Some of the answers have forced to me to reflect on my decision. I think overall I am asshole simply because I am not paying back what I owe to the US as a whole. It's not something I want to do but it's my best option and I feel like if I stay I'm being an asshole to my parents with whom I'll have to live with for the next decade or more. I would go back in time and do my bachelors in Europe if I could but I can't change the past and I can only work to make the future better. The student loan crisis in America is a travesty and I wish that all students could just finish their studies and not have to be in debt for decades.

Instead they did a lottery for each game. I've entered several times but haven't been selected. The same is true for a friend of mine until this past week. He got tickets to the game yesterday and asked me if I wanted to go. It was fine with my wife because we didn't have plans, so I told him that would be fine. 

My wife and I have been trying for a baby, and as luck would have it, she found out yesterday morning before I left. She told me right away and we had a little time to celebrate, but then I had to leave to meet my friend. I asked her before I left if she wanted me to stay, and she said no. Go to the game and have fun. Under different circumstances I would have stayed and spent the day focusing on her pregnancy news, but this is probably the only game I'll attend this year and I doubt I'll attend any next year since we'll have a baby. 

I went but when I got home she was cold and distant. Then when I woke up this morning she'd left and gone over to her mom's, which is where she spent the day. She didn't talk to me much when she got home, but she was upset because I went to the game instead of celebrating my wife's pregnancy. She thinks I should have insisted that I stay home and focus on that instead. 

The thing is, we could have celebrated today as well. We could have even done it last night. Nothing prevented that except her bad mood. I think her attitude about the whole situation is ridiculous and she has no right to call me the asshole because there were plenty of ways we could have celebrated and she even told me to go. It seems like she's really upset with herself and blaming me, but that's not my fault, I think.

164,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jnlb10/aita_for_buying_an_investment_property_and/,AITA for buying an investment property and kicking out a tenant?,"Hello reddit,

I'm a young person and I'm looking to buy a rental property as an investment. After searching for months, I've found an incredible opportunity with a specific property. It has 4 units which are all currently rented out. 3 of those units have fair market rent and 1 of those units has an individual who is paying 50% of market rent for the unit because he's been there for 10 years. He knows the previous landlord well and was able to get a great deal when he first moved in and the seller hasn't raised the rent on him since.

Now, in order for the investment to be worthwhile for me I would need to evict this tenant in order to raise the rents. I can evict the tenant legally by claiming to move in, moving in for a while and then turning around and re-renting the unit once he's gone. I wouldn't mind moving in temporarily either while I find someone else to rent, I could use the time to paint and modernize the unit.

That being said, I could just opt to invest in another property where I don't have to evict someone from their unit. This would mean I would make less money but there are still other profitable units out there. Realistically, any other investor would do the same but I'm questioning whether I want to participate in this type of behavior.

AITA for wanting to invest in this property, leading to this guy getting evicted out of his apartment?

**Edit**: Specifically, I know that this is the way life and capitalism are but I'd like to engage the question on a moral level? Am I doing some unethical?

**Edit x2:** To clarify, I haven't done this yet and I'm asking because I'm conflicted. I know for a fact that there are other offers on the property that stipulate this tenant needs to leave before assuming the property. There is also the point to consider that because I am sensitive to this, I would give this tenant time and flexibility to leave whereas others might be more draconian in their approach. Either way, I'm asking this because I don't feel comfortable and am trying to examine the ethicality of the situation.

**Edit x3:** Wow.. the responses have been overwhelming to say the least. Let me clarify a few things that I've seen come up a few times in the comments.

1. In my jurisdiction, I can't simply raise the rent to market rates when the tenant's lease is up. There is a maximum rent increase of 2.5%/year here. If I tried to raise the rent by the legal limit, it would take me until 2050 to reach 2020 market rent, not factoring inflation.
2. I know the tenant has a stable job with decent pay and could afford to pay market rents.
3. I wouldn't be doing anything that is illegal. I would move into the unit as my full-time place of residence for as long as legally required. Sorry if this wasn't clear in the original post.

**Finally, I have decided NOT to pursue this investment**. For me, the most important argument is that I will be causing this tenant great discomfort by uprooting them from the life that they've become so familiar with. And further, I'd only be doing it to make some extra money which I'm fortunate enough to not need. No, I'm not ""rich"" by any means but I do have enough to cover my needs and have some runway in case of emergencies. I'd much rather make less money (or no money) in an ethical way and hopefully a better opportunity will come along in the future.",2020-11-03 23:16:21,437,874,0.9,124,11,41,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,

My twin brother was a hot mess and died of a drug overdose in 2009. His girlfriend announced she was pregnant and gave birth in back of an abandon bus. Obviously she lost custody. I was next of kin so I adopted my nephew although we refer each other as father/son and he is doted by everyone.

My son was diagnosed with a rare form of diabetes (diabetes inspidious) last year which his doctor told him was genetic. I have NO one with that in my family I mentioned it was probably from his mother's side. That sparked an interest in learning about his family tree. He asked for a 23andme DNA test which I gladly bought for him knowing it would show people from our side of the family. Nothing shocking.

Well I was SHOCKED. When his results were ready, I viewed them before he did. He is not blood related. He is basically Russian and  Ashkenazi on the paternal side when it shows German and English on my side. It made sense. He looks nothing like me or his birth mom. This doesn't change anything, but it would destroy him to find out. He was wishing that there would be one family member  with their shit together and maybe give him a sense of history.

My kid wanted to see the results himself so I showed him mine pretending it was his. He thought it was the coolest thing ever.

I feel guilty beyond belief because he and I have always had a transparent relationship and I am here deceiving him.",2020-11-13 03:41:45,171,1449,0.96,56,14,18,0,,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,

He came out as bisexual to his parents and unfortunately for him, it didn't go down to well. My wife (his blood aunt) was too kind to just stand by and watch her nephew struggle so we took him in.

He was great at first. He is 17 so our kids (5F, 8M & 10M) took to him instantly and saw him as their ""cool"" cousin. He is great with the kids and had no issues babysitting them for us. I can't really complain about the boys behaviour. He's polite, kind and just generally a nice boy.

Everything was absolutely fine for the first month but after a while, my middle son started acting up. Andy has very long (often dyed) hair, around waist length. Our 8yo started asking if he was allowed to have hair like his cousins. He would complain constantly that he didn't have ""cool"" hair and whenever we told him he can't grow his hair out at the minute, he'd have a complete tantrum (he's 8, not a baby). Andy and our 10yo were the only two that could calm him down from these tantrums as he didn't want to speak to us, we were the ones that told him no after all. He, like our other kids, goes to a private school and whilst long hair is not against any rules, it is frowned upon as they don't think it looks very smart.

Anyway, this continued for a long while. Until a couple of days ago. My 8yo all but strutted into the room and told us that he can have his hair however he wants when he's bigger and there's nothing his ""stupid mum and dad"" can do about it. When I asked him where he got that idea from, he said Andy told him.

I spoke to Andy and (though I know he didn't say the stupid mum and dad part) he admitted that he'd told his cousin that when he was older he'd be able to do whatever he wants with his hair. Which is fine, he can have long hair when he's older if he wants, but our 8yo has started telling us all of the things he can do when he's older and how we can't do anything about it. Just generally getting quite an attitude. I do blame Andy for this, he should've just told him that he couldn't have long hair. It all came to a head yesterday when I snapped at Andy when he was brushing out his hair (and getting comments from our son about how jealous he was of his hair). I was sick of all the hair talk so I yelled at my nephew and told him he could either get his hair cut to an normal length or he could find somewhere else to stay. I was sick of my son acting like a jealous little girl. No kid should be that fixated on hair for god's sake.

My wife and I had a fight, she thinks I was completely in the wrong. Andy hasn't spoken to me at all. He didn't even argue back. That's what makes me regret my outburst a bit, he looked so sad. I didn't mean it and if he tries to speak to me I will apologise sincerely. But I do think the silent treatment is a bit over the top, he knows I wouldn't try to hurt him on purpose. AITA?

Edit/Small update -

Okay I tried to read all the comments. It hurts to read all the YTA's but you guys are right. I was an absolute asshole. I let my wife read through some of them and she agrees with what you guys are saying.

I decided to be the adult and go talk to Andy. I apologised for what I did and told him that I really don't have any issue with his hair, I was just stressed out with my 8yo's behaviour and I lashed out at him. It was not right and I should never have done it, I wish I could take it back but I can't.  In turn, Andy told me that he'd been absolutely terrified that he was going to get kicked out, poor boy even had a bag pack just waiting for me to ask him to leave. He told me he felt that I didn't want him in my house and that I thought he was a burden.  I have never felt more disgusted in myself, I have unintentionally been making him think that he wasn't welcome, way before I lashed out at him.

I had a chat with my wife (apologised to her) and we're currently looking online for new wallpaper and stuff, we want to decorate the guest bedroom that Andy's staying in to make it his bedroom, then hopefully he'll feel more welcome in his new home. I admit it was my wife's idea but I wholeheartedly support it. Andy and I are going to go out shopping for some smaller things for his room (posters,lamps etc.) and just have some time to bond.

Things are going a lot better. I spoke to my 8yo about his attitude problem. Like someone suggested, I told him he can grow his hair out over the summer holidays if he wants but he has to stop being so cheeky to myself and his mum and the tantrums have to stop. This has cheered him up a great deal.

Over all I am glad I posted here, I really needed the reality check. I know I got pretty defensive at first, I hope you folks can forgive me for that. Thank you all, seriously.",2020-11-04 23:44:23,351,1272,0.92,216,0,4,0,,,,1,,,2,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm retired and live on my own. My granddaughter moved from across the country before Coronavirus began, and when it started, she moved in with me to keep me company. She has a dog and a cat that have moved with her. She pays me $100 a week for board & lodgings.

Since July, she's been going to study four days a week, 9-3, and since September, one day of study, 9-1, and four days of work practical, 8.30-5.30.

I make her smoothies in the morning every day, but when she's at home on the weekends, she always conveniently forgets to wash out the blender. And when she has a plate of hers to wash, she never does any of the other dishes in the sink. I cook most nights and she does the dishes afterwards, but I've told her that she is to start cooking on Mondays too, since she finishes study at 1pm.

I do all the cleaning, except every second Saturday, she mops the whole house. She is to keep her two rooms clean and vacuum the floors and keep the windows open for fresh air. I do all the washing and maintenance around the house. She is to fold up her own clothes and put them away. Her dog and cat are her responsibility, she has to feed them, wash them, and clean up their poop.

But when she gets home, she immediately leaves the house to avoid helping me with cooking or folding clothes and goes for a ride with her dog. After she returns, she just eats dinner, does the dishes, and goes on her computer for the rest of the night! And on the weekends, she's always in the spare room on her computer playing games or out on her scooter with her dog.

She never says goodnight and I find her already asleep when I check in on her. She always says she's tired from practical or doing her assessments, and then she drives an hour to the city to hang out with friends or get a haircut.

She never wants to help out and it's already a hassle to get her to cook one meal a week. I started telling her to do her own washing loads, and she says she doesn't have the time or energy to do it. And when I asked her to start gardening as well, she flat out refused and said I should do it because I'm home all the time.

It had been a very stressful year for her because her father had passed(not due to the pandemic) so she kinda wanted to let loose a bit and try drinking. She liked the taste of my margarita  so she got some herself. She was gulping them down like juice because”This is good! It doesn’t even really taste too alcoholly.” We tried to warn her but to no avail. She gulps a couple down much quicker than you should and gets drunk as fuck. My normally sweet and shy gf apparently is a freak on the inside because it gets let loose.

My wife and I have a values difference regarding pets, combined with a health issue, which has left us at an impasse.

The getting-a-dog part of the story:

(Note: the following is simplified)

A few years ago, my wife and son decided in favor of getting a dog ""eventually."" We weren't going to go dog shopping or anything, but we'd keep our eyes open for a good opportunity. I was ecstatic - I love dogs and have wanted one for a while.

About a year ago, I found a few puppies being mistreated near my work. Long story short, she agreed to keep the one I'd gotten attached to. I knew she wasn't exactly enthusiastic, but I figured that was mostly due to the surprise factor.

Since she wasn't hugely into the idea of getting a dog, the deal was that the dog would be a combination of my and our son's responsibility. He's 9, so naturally, more on me. I readily agreed.

For many months, this went great. We had long walks together, I took care of all the training and stuff, things were going wonderfully. My wife even grew to ""appreciate"" the dog, even if not exactly love him.

So, I'd believed that she had fully agreed to the commitment that is getting a dog, even if things didn't go quite like we'd envisioned.

The problem:

A few months ago, a weird nerve thing happened in my back/leg and it's causing me a hell of a lot of trouble. Walking is really difficult. I've got an MRI scheduled, but it's months away, since it's non emergency.

We're in our 30's, and my health isn't exactly fantastic, so we're worried that this isn't going to be fixable, and it'll be my new normal. At the moment, that means my wife has to pick up the dog walking duty. My son's too young to do that on his own. I'm still doing everything else.

She didn't ""sign up for this,"" and doesn't want to do it. She wants to get rid of him. (Note: not get rid of him *now.* But if I don't recover and can't resume walks. This is a future possibility, not an immediate thing.)

To me, once you get a pet, that pet is family. You don't get rid of a pet for any reason short of ""we really have no choice."" Now, this really isn't ideal, and I get that.

Her perspective is: it would be bad for him to not get regular walks. Thus, that would be mistreating him. Thus, it would be better to get rid of him. She sees it as 3 options - we mistreat her (by forcing her to go on walks), we mistreat the dog, or we let him go.

Which I totally, completely understand. That said... deep down, I feel like that's just not something that's done. You don't get rid of pets if it's reasonably possible to keep them.

FWIW, my son is also firmly against getting rid of the dog.

We have come up with a tentative arrangement until the MRI results come in, at least. So it's not immediate.

I want to push to keep finding arrangements that involve us keeping the dog, even if he doesn't get as many walks as is ideal, even if it puts extra responsibilities on my wife. (We've ""traded"" some chores, so she doesn't have a net increase of responsibility. She just doesn't like spending time with him. She likes watching us play with him, but doesn't want to do anything with him herself.)

WIBTA for pushing for that outcome?

(Note: specifically, I'm asking if my feelings / values are a valid moral foundation. Is it reasonable to treat this as a moral issue, as opposed to pure logistics. I'm not asking if it's okay to force her to do things. That's obviously not okay. If she puts her foot down, obviously she is the priority here.)

INFO: since it's been brought up a bit, I figured I'd mention that the dog is a big (80 lbs) husky cross. (Note: he's a mutt. We believe he has a decent chunk (no more than 1/4) of husky or Malamute, but it's a guess)  A little neighborhood walk doesn't do any good. Seriously, 2 hours and he's still full of energy. His walks are off leash in the woods, only thing that wears him out. That's why my son can't walk him.

And we can't afford a dog walker, aside from occasionally.",2020-11-24 02:09:15,220,167,0.93,33,15,22,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They have 12 subjects but they would be reduced to 8. My son likes Physics but in a couple of years physics will get much harder, so I removed Physics and he would do Biology and Chemistry. He likes Computer Science but Business and Accounting has more career opportunities so I removed Computer Science, I had to choose between Geography and Christianity , he is Christian so I selected that. Apparently he did not like this subjects and he came to my room in panic that he had been told he had to do Biology, Business and Accounting and Christianity instead of his favourite subjects. I admitted it that I chose it for him and he begged me to change it. I changed it but my wife keeps telling me that I am terrible and that I broke my son's trust. In my opinion I just chose what I thought was best for him but she says that it was so messed up of me to do it without asking him. I do not think I broke his trust and I rectified m problem so I do not think I am the asshole but my wife keeps insisting I am. So AITA for choosing my sons subjects for him. BTW  these subjects influence what you can choose as a career and my son wants to be a software engineer so that is why my wife thinks I broke his trust and I am the asshole.

EDIT: I talked to my son after he finished playing games with his friends, I apologised and we discussed what he wants to do. He wants to do software engineering. I understand why the statistics for CS students are bad now. We have about 2 million graduates every year from high school and most of them chose CS as it is considered easier and less boring. They go to university and then flood the job market. The number of jobs are not very high  but higher than B&A . Many of them remain unemployed because all of the jobs are taken. B&A are much less and  get job easily. It makes sense now . My son wants to move to Germany and apply for citizenship. I will get him a tutor to teach him German, I bought him a Udemy course for now. I think I will be able to support him moving there because  we got  an education plan when he was a child and it has enough money to let him live there. I also got him a subscription to brilliant, which is something he has wanted since he was 11. I am going to take him to code camp after covid( spend 2 months learning how to code).

My friend (27F) and I (24F) were at my apartment just hanging out and talking about stuff when my boyfriend came and asked if I needed anything because he was going out to check on his friend who recently gave birth. I said no and he left. My friend 'Ally' then said how she hates how lucky some people are and unlucky she is. I asked what she was talking about and she said her inability to have her own children and the endless hoops she needs to jump to adopt when all she really wants is a child and now because the timing is perfect and her life will be afterwards (she's infertile due to a childhood accident). I joked about how much I'd hate being pregnant or being a mother. I've practically raised my siblings and that's my fair share for this lifetime. She said that I was lucky and that wished she could get pregnant like me. So I said that I considered her lucky and wished that I could be infertile so my boyfriend and I wouldn't have to be so crazy with this double protection thing since we both don't want kids but I don't want to be put in the position to abort because I honestly don't know what I'd do. 

She just stared at me and said that what I said was a bitch thing to say since I know how much she wants children yet I'm acting like it's comparable to to me not wanting kids when mines a choice, and all so my boyfriend and I could ""fuck raw"". I said that was disgusting and 'kicked' her out (told her to leave). Our friends have been on my arse though about how insensitive and inconsiderate I was to her condition by saying I wished I was infertile and had the audacity to kick her out when she pointed out my behavior.

I (22M) live in an 'indoor' apartment building, like the kind you see on FRIENDS. My next door neighbor is heavily pregnant, and the father of her baby (and on-and-off boyfriend) dumped her a few weeks prior to my making this post. 

How do I know this? Well, it's just one of the many personal things that she told me. 

My neighbor, who I shall call Lynne, is always lingering around my apartment, and always somehow knows when I'm leaving. Whenever I go to grocery shop, Lynne manages to catch me both on the exit and return trip, and talks my ear off. Whenever I go to my friends' house for band practice (five times a week, but possibly all seven, depending) she is right there in the hallway. She has told me many personal things that I have no business knowing, and quite frankly, don't wanna know, such as - her rocky childhood, previous boyfriends that have been abusive, her recent ex who dumped her, her 'sexcapades', and so many other things. 

I have tried to be friendly and politely remove myself from the situation, but there's a reason that I live alone, and I just couldn't anymore. Multiple times, I have used the fire escape outside of my window just to be left alone. I feel sorry for Lynne, but I don't actually like her, and don't have any interest in hearing her talk whatsoever. Does that make me a jerk? Possibly. But just you wait-

Lynne has, multiple times, knocked on my door, asking if she could have some of the meals that I make because she can smell them through the vents. She has asked that I stay over with her at night because she's scared to be alone since we live in a horrible part of the city, and then when I try to refuse, cries and whines until I agree. I have gone to the store several times for her, I've somehow ended up at a few ultrasound appointments (I think that's the correct term) and have even lended her money for baby supplies. 

Earlier today, she approached me while I was leaving to check the mail and started to talk about her mom, who doesn't seem like a pleasant lady but is, apparently, 'stable'. She ranted and raved for a few minutes before I finally said - (I'm paraphrasing here, since I can't remember exactly) - ""Can you just shut the fuck up and leave me alone already? I'm not your husband."" 

As you can expect, she got quite upset, and went back into her apartment. I don't know how I should feel about that, but I'm feeling a little guilty. I know that I'm a jerk, but am I the asshole here?

EDIT- For everybody who keeps theorizing that I'm the dad of this baby - I'm asexual, and haven't had sex in two years. SHE WAS PREGNANT WHEN SHE MOVED IN! 

Also, I accept my judgement.",2020-10-16 22:17:35,545,5195,0.96,148,3,62,54,,,,1,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
176,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jiizu6/aita_for_giving_an_engagement_gift_to_only_the/,AITA for giving an ‘engagement gift’ to only the groom-to-be and not giving anything to his fiancé?,"So I (28F) been close friends with my friend Jack (27M) for more than a decade. He lives in a different city now while I still live in our hometown, but we still talk everyday and are basically each other’s confidantes.

Last year Jack began dating Ashley (26F) and within two months of seeing each other, they moved in together and Jack told me that he really thinks that Ashley is the one. I was happy for Jack because he’s been through a string of toxic relationships before Ashley, and based on the things he tells me about her, she seems like a stable and sweet person. 

To this day, I have never met nor talked to Ashley for even 15 seconds. Whenever Jack visits our hometown to see his mother, he goes alone or when he’s with Ashley they just stay for just a few hours and Jack never invites me or our other friends to meet Ashley. I don’t ask if I could meet up with them because Jack’s mother is going through chemo so I thought maybe Jack wants to spend the limited time they have with his mom.

Jack, his friend Tom and I also play video games online regularly, but he doesn’t include Ashley in our conversations when we do voice coms, even though I know she’s just nearby because I can hear her talking to him. Sometimes I say “Hi Ashley!” when I hear her in the background and she replies with “Hello Nikki!”, but that’s it. Neither of us has really made any effort to know the other better - I guess we were fine with just knowing each other as Jack's girlfriend and Jack's friend.

So a few weeks ago Jack suddenly messaged me asking about engagement rings. I asked if he was popping the question to Ashley, and he said yes. I was really happy for Jack, and I decided that I would buy the watch that he wants but hasn’t been able to afford. That way, he can have something he wants for himself after shelling out three grand for an engagement ring. The watch is about $800, which was not spare change for me, but it’s for someone I consider to be my younger brother so I’m fine with spending a bit this time.

Jack proposed to Ashley last Friday (October 23). I ordered the watch in October 9 and it arrived at Jack’s house last Sunday. While he sounded excited when he thanked me for my gift, Tom later told me that Jack and Ashley fought about it. Apparently Ashley got mad because I gave Jack an ‘engagement gift’ while I didn’t get her anything.

My boyfriend told me that what I did was insensitive, I should apologize to Ashley and send her something. To be honest, I don’t understand it though. I didn’t send them an engagement gift that only Jack can use, I just sent my friend a personal gift. I will get them an engagement gift that is for both of them and both of them can use when they have their engagement party. I don’t know why Ashley expects me to send her a personal gift either if that’s the case, because we don’t even have a relationship.

They wanted it to be a family naming thing where both families sat and brainstormed names to help connect us more through their son. They came over to my wife and I's house and we started talking names. Her family is Turkish so they were suggesting these Turkish names and we were suggesting English names and neither were unanimously happy with any name. Then my DIL suggested the name ""Kaaniel"". I repeated it and she 'corrected' me by saying it in the exact same way I did. I said that sounded weird and I asked what it meant and she just paused and kept looking left and right so I asked if it was some made up name because I didn't want my grandson walking around with some nonsensical name just so he could be different. 

I believe that my tone wasn't that strong or intense but she looked down and then awkwardly left the room. Then my son explained that the name was a combination of Kaan (Turkish) and ""iel"" (from Gabriel or Daniel) which would roughly mean ""God is my ruler"" if I remember correctly and my dil's mother then said the name again with better pronunciation like ""kaan*yal*"" which was different to my DIL's ""aa"" sound which was short like ""kan"" and ""eel"" instead of ""yal"". Hard to explain the linguistics but it sounded better and we all liked the meaning. We then spoke about other things.

Later I find out that DIL was crying where she was because she felt I was insulting her idea by calling it nonsensical, making her feel stupid and apparently shut it down as if I actually had vetoing powers when it came to the name. I don't get the point of suggestions if she's going to get upset over mine and if I was honestly that dismissive her mother would've said something but I had no objections apologizing if she was that upset by it. That was until my son mentioned that she doesn't want to use the name now because I can't call something nonsense then flip the script and like it. Furthermore she'd like my wife and I not to be involved in the naming process until I've apologized and 'showed understanding of my role'.

She refuses to do the simplest, most reasonable tasks. I’ll lay out every way she misbehaves; 

1.) She never wears her eye contacts (which she needs to see) even though I nag her to all of the time

2.) She locks herself in her room all of the time 

3.) She either doesn’t eat with us (my family) at dinner or she doesn’t eat dinner at all (she takes her food up to her room with her and sometimes she eats it, most of the time she leaves it in a drawer or something). 

4.) She refuses to wear anything less than a long-sleeved shirt, pants and socks even during summer. Often wearing ratty old clothes over and over again. This makes it difficult for my family to go out and do anything if it isn’t winter because it is too hot for her to come dressed like that. 

5.) She does poorly at school and wastes her education, she often doesn’t even hand in assignments on time and skips class (causing me to have to speak to her teachers about it), some days she outright refuses to go to school. 

6.) On top of all this, you can’t have a conversation with her at all, it is like talking to a brick wall... a brick wall that can’t stand a second talking to you. You can just tell she can’t stand you or anyone in the family for that matter. She is always curt and angry with me. Sometimes she is huffing and puffing in anger, but she always talks to me in an angry, curt tone.

Family is very important to most of my, well, family. The exception is my sister who developed a different sort of values system once she left home. I still love her absolutely but there's some friction there to start with.

A few years ago she and her husband adopted a child. She's perfectly capable of having biological children and she and her husband would make amazing parents, this was some sort of 'moral' choice on their part but I think calling it a 'protest' would be more accurate.

The kid came with a name that's traditional to where it came from and definitely stands out as non-native where I live. (Before the Americans start, no, this isn't a black vs white thing. Think more Wojciech vs. Walter.) She refused any advice to rename him.

The issue then: when I'm talking to friends and colleagues I use a different name for my nephew. One that's traditional to our country and that fits in with the names of the rest of my family. It saves having to answer awkward questions or talk about the adoption and is just easier all round. These are people who 100% are never going to meet this kid, it doesn't effect him or my sister in any way at all.

My sister found out (through some thoughtless comment from our father) and was incredibly angry, went on a huge rant that unnecessarily dragged up a lot of her other general issues about me and our family and is refusing to come to Christmas. Not sure what her husband thinks as we don't get on too well to begin with.

She also tried to argue that this has something to do with the fact that he's adopted, but if she'd named a biological child this I'd have done exactly the same thing. Whether it's fine to name your child anything you want is something different people seem to disagree on (not many people are going to defend a name like Sephiroth right?) which is another reason I'm asking here.

Obviously I understand names and identity are important, or I wouldn't have done this to begin with. But I never use this 'fake' name when I see my nephew or my sister. He's totally unaware, it's a completely victimless crime and she could just think of it as a harmless nickname without melting down like this. I want to keep the peace but it seems ridiculous to go back to all these people who, again, are never going to meet my nephew and issue a redaction.

I'd like to add, which I forgot to originally, when they adopted him he was too young to know his own name.

I think I might be the asshole because I did realize my sister probably wouldn't be happy if she found out and I really *don't* want to upset her. But otoh feels like a mountain/molehill situation at this point.

Reddit verdict then? AITA for not always using my nephew's birth name?

Edit: People keep commenting on the 'it' thing so I just wanted to clarify, it was bad grammar on my part, the 'it' was supposed to be referring to the name, not my nephew.

Edit 2: Just for the record, I do love my nephew and consider him very much part of our family - our culture *is* his culture now, using a different name is a reflection of that. I don't expect verdicts to change, just don't want people to think I don't' care about the little guy.

Edit 3: I know how frustrating it is reading posts where the person just refuses to accept their verdict so I just wanted to say - I've read most of your replies and I'm going to try and come to some sort of understanding with my sister. Family is the most important thing and if I hurt her I need to put other things aside. ",2020-11-17 19:46:58,288,217,0.78,123,0,4,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A little backstory: I live with my husband and 2 stepchildren. I can’t get pregnant and I’ve been a mother figure in his kids lives for the past 10 years or so. They are 17 and 13. I’ll call the 17 year old Jason. We have been living in our current house since 2014 and are still the newest to the block. We are on good terms with the neighbors, but not necessarily friends besides one couple. They are all very good people and always willing to lend a hand. 

Our neighbors from 4 houses down are a younger husband and wife. They have 2 little girls that stepdaughter babysits for pretty frequently. Maybe not weekly but biweekly atleast. The husband is a police officer for the next town over, and the wife has actually gone out with me and the other neighbor I’m friends with before. My family knows who all of them are and they know who all of us are. 

2 days ago, Jason comes home from his friends house around 11 pm. He is cursing and flinging stuff around in the kitchen, managing to wake up my husband and I. We went down to see what was going on, pretty upset due to the noise. He then handed us a ticket, and said “Mr. Lastname pulled me over and gave me a speeding ticket.” We both were angry at him, until we saw he was going 32 in a 25. My husband and I looked at eachother and immediately started ranting about how that’s absolute bullshit. He knows exactly who our son is, and he was going 7 over. We have other friends in law enforcement who say there’s sort of an unwritten rule that says 12 over is when you stop someone. 

I told SD I don’t want her to babysit for them until I talk to them. The next day i went outside as she was taking their dog for a walk, and asked her what was up with her husband giving Jason a ticket. She claimed she had no knowledge of it. I explained the situation and she apologized profusely and admitted that was an AH thing for husband to do. I could tell she was very embarrassed and now I feel a little bad. She said she would even talk to him about dropping it. Was I wrong to confront her about this?",2020-10-14 19:10:04,900,2081,0.89,288,0,1,0,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We'd already bought plane tickets and booked the hotel in advance etc. 

Then her mother died and she had to go home (from Maine to North Carolina) for the funeral. I don't know her family so I figured it would be weird and pointless for me to go with her. 

Girlfriend said she still wanted to come back in time go on the trip but I knew she'd be depressed and down the whole time so it wouldn't be any fun anyways. So I told her to just forget about it, and I'd cancel the trip. 

But instead I asked my sister [21F] if she wanted to go since I already had the two tickets booked and the hotel booked and didn't actually want to waste the money. She said yes, so we went. I told her not to tell my girlfriend or anyone else, and not to post any pictures on social media or anything. No one else knew we were even going, so that was fine. As far as my GF knew I cancelled the trip, and by the time we got back from Hawaii she was still with her family in NC. Since GF thought the trip was cancelled she stayed there even longer than she would have, otherwise. She finally returned home about a week later, and never figured out I'd left at all, and I figured 'what she doesn't know can't hurt her.' 

Well anyways last week my sister finally slipped up and mentioned 'our trip to Hawaii last year,' and my girlfriend figured it out pretty quick was furious that I went on the trip without her while she was at a funeral.

I told her I didn't even see how it mattered because I wasn't going with her to the funeral anyways, so there was literally no difference on her end between me sitting at home while she was at the funeral and me going to Hawaii. She said that wasn't the point and the point was that I lied to her so I didn't have to take her with me, which is technically true, but only because I knew it would have just ruined the trip anyways since she would have been depressed the whole time. She also said it was 'weird' that I took family on what was supposed to be a 'romantic' trip (people seriously think siblings doing *anything* together is weird these days -- Game of Thrones has broken everyone's brains I swear).

She said that if I didn’t trust her to not be a wh*re that maybe we need to rethink our relationship. I told Brit that it wasn’t about me distrusting her, that I thought it be a good idea for anyone. I said that everyone that gets cheated on trusts their partner, and that people that think their partners are going to cheat on them end the relationships. She argued that if I wanted a pregnancy test, that literally means I have doubts that the baby is mine. I said that as a man I really don’t have much of a way to know if a baby that she gives birth to is mine or not, and that it doesn’t hurt to just see it written out.

She said she didn’t want to talk about it for a while, and said she needed to think about our relationship since we’re “lacking trust of one another”. She’s still pretty sore at me for this. I spoke to my older sister about this and she called me and d!ck for saying what I did.

Husband and I have been married 11 years. We recently went through a relationship transition where we are no longer intimate or romantic. We raise kids together; he is what I consider a ""nest partner.""

The reason this happened is because he has had a lot of trouble owning his personal self over these last 11 years. When I met him, he was very teenage-like (at 30) but none of that has really changed over the years (now 43.) It has been years of emotional immaturity, lying, and avoiding conflict and I am finished with it. But we remain partners for the kids and the necessity of nostalgia and economy.

Anyhow, so one thing he has struggled with is his drinking. There have been times where he has managed it but most of the time, it's a disaster. It's especially bad when he's bored or stressed out. Right now he is on leave from the Navy because he has to use all his leave days before next fiscal year. So he's bored.

So, I bought a few beers for him and my boyfriend last night (my boyfriend lives with us.) I also bought myself a 2L of my favourite cider to have later this week. Well, at 3am, my boyfriend (who likes to snack at night) tells me that the beer fridge has completely been emptied of all swill, including my cider. I'm annoyed but whatever, nothing new when my husband's drinking (he just consumes everything.)

So (getting to the AITA part,) I go to get a cat litter scoop from my husband's room and it's a disaster this morning. We have 2 old cats (the 16 year old cat is my baby and he has IBD, diabetes, and renal failure) so we have to have CLEAN litter boxes all over the place, including our rooms upstairs. I glance down at the litter box in his room and it's FULL. Like, it's full like someone poured a whole jug of water in it full. His room had been closed all night and I'm pretty sure his little 19 year old void cat didn't make that much piss.

So I asked him outright, ""Did you piss in the cat litter box???""

He tried to deny it at first but then had to fess up because there was no way he was going to explain it. And I flipped out!!! Like, seriously, I'm managing the entire house, kids, boyfriend, old sick cats, bills, meals...and my 43 year old husband can't take his drunk ass downstairs to take a piss?????? Am I the asshole here? And he acts like it's not a big deal, like I should just get over it and let it go. He hasn't given me any hope in the last 11 years that his behaviour is getting any safer or better (he's driven drunk recently, which he has never done and he's hurt himself a few times falling and stumbling.)

I'm just tired of the antics.",2020-11-26 18:30:34,139,238,0.88,24,0,13,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I asked my GF if she could cover my half of the rent while I searched for a new job. She knows that finding a job can be difficult for me due to a felony I received when I was young and full of mistakes. 
She told me she wouldn’t be able to make enough money because she’s in college full time at the moment. I told her to take a break for the time being so she could support us through this tough time. She told me absolutely no that her degree is what’s most important. She told me if I wasn’t able to cover the rent she would just move back to her parents. (She’s not on the lease)
I told her she made a commitment to me when she moved in. That we were partners living together in this apartment and I expected her to be there for me.

187,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jlltvt/aita_for_telling_my_mother_that_i_had_it_worse/,AITA for telling my mother that I had it worse when our father (her husband) died?,"At thirteen (now 26), I lost my dad. His death was especially hard on me. I was the only kid still in the house, my siblings are older. My father’s death destroyed my mother. For months she neglected me. She made little effort to tend to me, and she spent most of her time crying alone in her room or with her sisters (who cared for me since my mother would not). I understand that she lost her spouse, but she was still a parent, and I feel that she failed to parent me in that time.

Since then, our relationship has not been great. She knows I hold her behavior against her and considers me selfish for it. I think the same of her. My siblings are sympathetic to both of us, but each leans toward agreeing with me or my mom. I have done therapy, and it was moderately helpful. Before, I wasn’t able to understand her perspective at all. Now, I see how this was difficult for her, but I still feel that she failed me. However, it did help, and things were mostly friendly between us up until a few weeks ago. 

These issues resurfaced recently because I am  pregnant. I was over at my mom’s talking to her and my sister and I asked my sister if, when she was pregnant, she thought about our dad and was she afraid of her children having to lose her early and go through what we went through. I started to talk about all the important life events my dad missed out on, and about how painful that time period was for me. At this point, my mother chimed in, saying that it was the hardest time in her life, and that watching us struggle made it even harder.

I thought it was incredibly rude of her to make a comment like that, knowing that she did nothing to make my dad’s death easier for me. So I said something like, “Well you sure didn’t show it.” She asked what I meant, and I told her that she completely neglected me, and that I Felt like I lost both parents. My mom started to cry and said that my dad’s death almost broke her. She said that she could barely take care of herself, and that she did her best to make sure that other people were supporting me. I told her that her grief over losing her husband, who she had 25 years with, couldn’t compare to me losing my dad so early. She actually got really mad and asked me to leave.

That was three weeks ago, and I haven’t heard from her since, but I’ve reached out. My siblings are torn, but my husband thinks that my mom is right and that I should apologize. He says that if I lost him, I may have a hard time functioning normally too. I say that he hasn’t lost a parent, especially so young, and he has no idea what it feels like to be ignored by your only living parent. Even if I was too harsh, I think that she is using this as another opportunity to act like a child instead of a parent. I’d like to know what other people who are removed from the situation think, since I am getting mixed feedback from my family. AITA?

ETA: first I want to thank everyone for replying. This has been a useful exercise and I can definitely acknowledge that I have to continue therapy. I want to be clear about a couple of things though so that my anger makes more sense, because I think that a lot of people are blowing it out of proportion (seriously suggesting that I can’t be a parent...?). When I said that my aunts took care of me, they handled me on a basic level. I ate and went to school. I have always had an allowance so it’s not as if I was in danger of starving or anything like that. However, I was thirteen years old and had never lost a loved one. I hadn’t even had a period yet and one of my worst memories is of when I got it and started crying and my mom came into my room for the first time since his passing to tell me to be quiet because I was being insensitive. My mother was checked out most of the time and would only engage if it was relevant to her own grief. Imagine having two parents one day, and no one the next. I was heartbroken and thought it was my fault at first. My aunts did not provide me emotional support; that was mostly my sibling closest in age who took a semester away from college so that I wouldn’t be literally by myself all day every day. For what it’s worth, of my four siblings, he is one of the two who sides strongly with my mom.

You will continue calling me the asshole and I will continue to consider it. I just don’t want people thinking that I made a comment like that because my mom was just “sad.”

ETA again: thank you all again for commenting. I can see that I was 100% the asshole to compare, and I am looking into sorting through my anger and pain. Hopefully with an apology from me, I will be able to open up the conversation with my mom again with a bit more willingness to truly empathize with her, because I understand now that I haven’t actually moved on.",2020-10-31 16:57:31,447,1076,0.93,73,23,46,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We told her that she could stay in the house until the end of the year till she could figure out alternative living arrangements, but we would be selling it early next year so that we can buy a new house in Texas.

Simply put my (30F) little sister 'Mary' (23F) is the sweetest, kindest, most naïve person I've ever met. Sometimes I swear she's a cartoon character. Shortly before everything went more to hell than usual, she got a new girlfriend, 'Susan' who's a lawyer, 50, and a millionaire. My little sister is a *film student* (no, I don't know why she felt okay studying that) who works at Starbucks.

My sister fell hard and fast, and from the times I've seen them together I see why. Susan is very affectionate and caring for my little sis. But...I don't trust her. No matter what I do, I can't wrap my head around *why* she's dating Mary. My sister has a lot of great qualities, don't get me wrong, but c'mon. 50 year old millionaires don't date film student baristas who are less than half their age. It's not a sugar baby situation, I've seen Mary push back on expensive gifts \*and\* she's talked to me about Susan being 'too eager' to pamper her. So it's not a sugar baby thing, and it's probably not just trophy/arm candy. 

But I just...there's no reason for a woman like Susan to want to date a girl so young who legitimately owns more Harley Quinn themed t-shirts than she does real shirts. Nobody in their 50s dates someone in their 20s unless they're a predator/abusive or there's money and status being exchanged. Since to the best of my knowledge it's not the latter, I feel safe in assuming it's the former, and I (as gently as I could) told Mary that. She, perhaps unsurprisingly, did not take it well. But neither did our parents, which *did* surprise me. Neither of them are doing well health wise, so I think they're just relieved Mary's got a stable and well off partner and don't care about the long term, but I'm getting frustrated with all the crap I'm getting, so I bring this to you Reddit.

So I (26f) had acquired a free hotel stay at a hotel with a swim park.  I invited my friend (27f) and her kids (5f and 10f) to come and stay there with me for the night so we all could swim at the swim park together.  Might I add that I invited them even though her kids can be bratty. I was just wanting to be nice. 

So, after we were done swimming we go back to the hotel room to shower and get changed into pajamas and order pizza. As my friend was helping the 5 y/o get dressed, the 5 y/o was dramatically acting pouty and just blurted out ""I don't like Nicole!"" In a bratty voice. (Let's call myself Nicole). 

I was immediately insulted because I invited them to stay with me there for free so we could all have fun, and  *this* is the thanks I get?? 

My friend asked her why, and the 5 year old said ""Because Nicole kept splashing me when I didn't want her to do it"" 

Then, THEN the 10 year old turns on me too (surprise surprise🙄) and takes the 5 year old's side. And said that I kept splashing her even though she was crying. (She's a dramatic brat, so it was most likely 99% crocodile tears) besides, IT'S A POOL! People get splashed. If you don't like getting splashed, then don't go swimming! 

I felt like I wasted my free pass on these two ungrateful kids (I'm not surprised to tell you the truth) 

My friend didn't tell her to apologize to me and just continued to get the 5 year old dressed and acted like she didn't hear the 5 year old insult me. 

I spoke up for my self and reminded them that If it wasn't for me they wouldn't be swimming and staying in a nice hotel and that they are being ungrateful and owed me an apology. My friend said and I quote ""She's 5, and frankly has a valid reason to not like you at the moment"" 

I told her my sentiments about it's expected to get splashed in a pool, and it was just harmless fun. My friend stuck to her guns and still wouldn't make her daughter apologize to me. 

We argued for half an hour with her telling me to just drop it, but why should I?? I don't appreciate being treated like trash after I do a nice thing for them. 

I then told her that I was going to drive home (leaving them there to figure out how to get home (no uber in that town)since I drove them there with MY car and MY gas money) because I was just done being used and treated like trash. If it were up to me, I wouldn't have shared my pizza with them either,  but to be fair, my friend paid for half of it. 

We ended up just going to bed. When we got up the next day, we were barely speaking and I drove them home. We haven't spoken since. So, am I the asshole in all this?? Or is she for not making her kid apologize?",2020-11-08 23:07:15,320,571,0.84,167,0,4,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My boyfriend knows I’ve been struggling with student loans for the last couple of years. I graduated with 95k in student loans and I make about 50k a year but between rent, my car, etc.. I still have so much left to pay. I’ve held off on getting a masters because of this debt. My boyfriend makes almost three times as much as me but we’ve always split bills 50/50.

We don't live together, she spends about half the week at mine every week because I have my own place.

When I first bought the safe I hadn't decided exactly where I was gonna house it. She asked if I was planning to bolt it to the floor or wall and when I told her I had no plans to do that, she became upset because she figured the safe was obviously not to protect my stuff from being stolen in the event of a burglary but rather to keep the contents away from her. it caused an argument.

during that argument I made it clear that my view is we both have a right to privacy. just because we're in a relationship doesn't mean we own each other and have to share every single thing with the other; I'm allowed to have things that are private, for my eyes only.

she disagrees and feels that it's unacceptable. she says that there could be alcohol and/or condoms in there for all she knows, which could be ""evidence of cheating."" for the record there has been no history of cheating whatsoever in our relationship, and I have a drinks cupboard in plain view in the kitchen

she has said that when we live together, me having a private safe that she doesn't know what's in it will not be acceptable. I feel that if I want one then that's my prerogative. AITA?

I guess I didn't really care either way about her at first, but the more she was around the more my disdain grew.

She's very fake cutesy and loud, frankly I find her outright repellent. I don't get exactly why they're together and I've outright told him that I don't like her and that I find her annoying. His only response has been I just have to deal with her being around. But I live here too and that just doesn't seem fair. 

The worst thing about this situation is that she's started playing our video games just cause she saw that my roommate and I play them. She made a League account where she mostly goofs off in TFT but duos with my roommate in blinds sometimes, he's trying to teach her how to play Guilty Gear and Mortal Kombat, and he has her over almost nightly to watch her slowly run through Dragon Quest XI. She's pretty awful at all these games and I kind of hate how she acts when playing, again very ditzy and obnoxious.

Since she started she's been asking I wanted to play with them ever I always reject cause I just don't want to be around them when they're together. Last night, they were playing League and I could hear her *screeching* through a call and ramble about things she just didn't understand about the game. I keep walking in while my roommate was playing, and I guess he thought I was signaling something because he asked if I wanted to join them. For the the first time I agreed because I hadn't played with him in a while so I was kind of missing it.

We started playing and I was trying to enjoy the game with my roommate, but her lingering presence kept my mood down. Whenever I tried to correct her on things or teach her about the game she seemed to be half listening or just forgets a couple minutes later. Most the time the two of them talked with each other, which made me wonder why I was even here in the first place. 

Eventually, by like game 5 I was completely frustrated. I picked Anivia (for those who don't get it, she's a character who can make walls that even your teammates can't walk through) and spent the game blocking her off from teamfights, leaving her behind walls, and overall just trying to get her to die as much as possible. This finally got her attention and she started getting sad and pretty distressed. My roommate was also tilting and tried to get me to stop. In the moment I didn't really care, I just wanted her to have as little fun as I was having. We ended up surrendering at the 20 minute mark and she was done for the night.

He came in my room to yell at me about the whole thing. I told him it was just a game anyways and she shouldn't be so sensitive about trolling in multiplayer games if she plans on playing them. He didn't want to hear my side of things and just went to bed.

I get that I frustrated them but it was only because she was annoying me first. I saw the whole thing as making her feel the same way I was feeling when I'm forced to be around her.",2020-11-21 12:30:36,169,283,0.82,89,0,3,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have always made sure that he gets his hair cut to an acceptable length and he has never had any complaints about it before. I don't see anything wrong with this as I am the same with his other siblings as well, I just want them to look smart and presentable.

However, lately he has been going through a goth phase. He's always wanted dark clothes, ""guyliner"", jewellery and absurd hairstyles. But now that he's older now and has his own money, he has started getting a bit more rebellious and has started dressing the complete opposite of the way he normally dresses. I have given in a lot when it came to the clothes, allowing black ripped jeans and horror t shirts, but I always drew the line at really long sweaters and certain things that look more like they are made for women. He has always had anxiety and self confidence issues so I just want to avoid any bullying about him looking like a girl. This then continued to his hair as well and he started growing it out.

As many people know, when going from a really short hairstyle to something long, there is a point in time where it starts to look really messy. A few of my friends mentioned how messy his hair looked but I assured them that it was just a phase and that he'd be back to his usual self in no time. But he didn't go back. The hair got longer and messier, I even heard a few of his weird friends saying he looked ""adorable"" with the messy hair.

Eventually I lost my patience and told him he either fixed his hair or started tying it up. He complained that it would look stupid tied back as it isn't long enough yet. But I was persistent about it. We had no barbers as this was during lock down but I was more than happy to cut his hair myself.

A few months ago, he came to me and asked me to shave his hair off, like I'd done with his brother (his brother was really happy with how his hair turned out). I complied. Immediately afterwards, my son started wearing a beanie. All the time. Even in the house. He refuses to take it off.

Last  night we had an argument and he brought up how disgusting and ugly he felt with short hair and how I'd taken away the one thing he actually liked about himself. I don't understand this, I think all my children are beautiful. He also brought up how his friend's parents let them express themselves and didn't judge them for their appearance. I tried to argue that I was just looking out for him, he'd been so happy since starting college and I didn't want that to be ruined by bullies. He has a very feminine face and long hair will just cause confusion and get him picked on. He left and hasn't spoken to me all day today. I think he's overreacting, especially considering it was him that came to me and asked me to shave his head, but my husband thinks I've been a little harsh.

AITA?

Edit 1

I'm getting a lot of responses from people saying that I am being overprotective. I think I have every right to be. When he was 18, not long after  I started to allow him to stay out at night as long as he told me who he was with, where he was, when he'd be back and what he was doing. He started to abuse this privilege and started sleeping around with several men, age of consent here is 16. He knew them beforehand and used protection but I was still furious. Word somehow got out and the neighbours opinions of him changed from him just being a weird quiet boy to a whore.

I think he did it to spite me and when I confronted him about it, he snapped at me that at least they made him feel loved and he actually felt good about himself when he was with them.

This has been the only other incident where my son has had the nerve to yell at me after disobeying me. I felt terrible that he thought I didn't love him so I have started reminding him that I love him everyday. I feel like I am justified to be protective of him as I don't want this to happen ever again.

I think I am as good a mother as I can be.

Edit 2

Okay I get it. ""I'm a terrible mother"" and don't deserve my son. He's an ""angel"" that can't do anything wrong.

Well I tried to apologise last night and he didn't accept it and when I get frustrated he walked away. I went to check on him later on and he'd cried himself to sleep. So thanks for the advice, it really helped.

Real last edit

I admit that IATA. My son had a full on panic attack because of me. I know I was extremely defensive in my comments and my post but I want to take the time to apologise. I'm sorry, you guys were 100% right. I am a terrible mother, I am going to end up losing my child and I need to step up.

He doesn't want to speak to me right now so I'm giving him time to himself something needs to be done. My husband was very blunt with me that I am not as good of a mother as I liked to think. ",2020-10-31 19:47:53,608,460,0.77,275,0,3,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are an Armenian family in France, and our membership in the Armenian Orthodox church is very important to our faith and to our family's social standing in the community.

Lately, my daughter has been reading atheist blogs and has been arguing with us about religion. I remind her that our religion is an important aspect of who we are and we expect her to attend church weekly as long as she is living with us.

This morning, she announced that she is done going to church since she wants to officially declare herself as secular. I reminded her once again that church attendance is a condition on her living with us as her not going would be a shame for the family within the Armenia community. I also reminded her that while our homeland is being attacked, the least she can do is pray.

She called me ridiculous and said that she can't wait to move out. I told her okay, so she has 12 days to pack up her things and find another living arrangement. She cried hysterically about how this was abusive during a pandemic. I said this is tough love and that is what it is like to live without a strong community (which will happens if she leaves the church).

She was only about 13 at the time but she took on all the household duties. My dad had to work double and was depressed after my mom died so we barely saw him.

She did the cooking and cleaning, with a bit of help from my older brother who was 11 at the time, when I started school she tutored me, didn't do extracurricular activities so she could be at my games and come home early. Even though she wanted to go to an out of province university she enrolled in one closer so she could take care of me. I'm grateful really but I feel kind of disappointed with our current relationship. See my sister really was a mom to me, she'd lecture me, punish me and annoy the heck out of me until I'd do my homework.

Even though she's married and has a kid now, she still acts like MY mom. She'll call me every few days to check up on me, she always wants to know my grades and she'll pop in with some food. She treats my older rother extremely differently though! When the three of go hiking together, she's making fun of my brother the whole time. She cheers me on, gives me an excess amount of water, makes us take multiple breaks so I can ""Rest for a moment"". I also want to have that sister-brother bond with her, I don't want her to be motherly anymore.

So I addressed my concerns with her about, she looked sad but said she'd try. For two weeks she was ok, a few mess up here and there but we were making progress but after that it just went back to the way it used to be. She thinks I haven't ate? Brings over some food. Asks me about me financial situation and my school life excessively and lectures me about how my house isn't clean enough(to her credit she was right it wasn't). Anyways after two weeks passed over her motherly shenanigans I snapped on a phone call and told her that I didn't not like our relationship at all.

She cried and I hung up. She's been texting me but I've been ignoring her, I just don't feel calm enough to deal with this. Half of me thinks she's trying her best and the other thinks she isn't. I love my sister and I don't want to snap at her, but when I was venting to my brother and some of my friends they told me I was the asshole. While others told me she was the asshole.

My wife (34f) and I (36m) have been married for six years with two sons (5 and 3). We are both members of the congregation of a comparatively progressive church and attended mass whenever we got the chance before the pandemic.

Flashback to April of this year. As per most Sunday mornings, my wife, kids, and I were attending weekly mass, though it was virtual now. Our priest, who we'll call Father Joseph, announced that our church would be hosting a Zoom event on Easter Sunday. After the service, him and I were messaging about the event. He seemed rather excited about the event, and since he always loved when I brought my sons to services I told him I would attend.

Now of course, as an avid Christian man and lover of holiday spirit, I decided that I would go all out for my sons and decorate the house so that this year's Easter as well as the event would still feel special for them despite what we were going through with it having been still around the beginning of the pandemic.

For the next few weeks leading up to Easter Sunday, my wife would sometimes ask me about what we were planning to do that day. I kept telling her not to worry, and that I had something planned. I wanted my big Easter plans to surprise her too, and she deserved a break. She didn't need to have the stress of planning a holiday for our sons on her shoulders too.

Skip to the morning of Easter Sunday. I was awake much earlier than the rest of the family, having been setting up my decorations and getting ready for the Zoom event. My wife came into the living room to see all of the pastel decorations and balloons, as well as the breakfast I had made especially for the kids. I stopped her when she went to eat the kid's breakfast, and she asked me why she couldn't eat it. I told her that I wanted everything to look perfect for the kids when they woke up, and that I had saved some extra pancakes for us.

Apparently that was the wrong answer.

My wife's birthday fell on the same day as Easter Sunday that year, and I got too caught up in trying to do something nice for the kids to pay attention to the date. Because of the pandemic, we have been spending much more time together now than ever before, and I am afraid that this mistake is causing a rift in our marriage. I really need to get an outside opinion on this, but I am not comfortable talking to anyone I know about this.",2020-11-05 03:09:57,387,505,0.87,201,2,3,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So my wife’s best friends got a divorce. She was really nasty about it and turned her kid against the husband. She ended up getting 8 k a month in child support. Yes 8 k a month like a average living wage for doing nothing. I thought she was going to use it for the child and to care for him and put half of the money into a index fund for him so he’s got 1.3 million by the time is 18 at a 8 percent return. But no she spent it on herself because she was too lazy to get a job. So I told her it’s  supposed to be used for the child and not her lazy ass.

I (32F) run a spirituality and witchcraft based group on Facebook and we've previously had meetups before Covid. It's a fun and educational space that many benefit from and we do our best to give info to those who can't access it themselves. 

We had a member (19F, joined at 18) who's been with us for a year. She started out as a fun member and was getting along great with everyone. All was well! 

That is, until we mentioned last week how we're going to be making and selling dreamcatchers as a way to raise money for a group event. She suddenly was quiet and messaged me personally (as I am admin) with concerns of """"""appropriation"""""". She said she was native American, and that her people make them and that they're sacred to her and she feels they shouldn't be made by us (since we're white people I bet 🙄). I had no prior knowledge of her apparent native American heritage. It seemed to come out of the blue. She's very light skinned and has short hair-something I've heard native Americans don't have as it's frowned upon in their culture to cut hair. She also doesn't talk or act any differently despite her apparent heritage. 

She told me that she lived on a reservation most of her life and only recently moved away. I didn't know of it, any of it. Quite frankly, it doesn't seem genuine to me. 

I told her it wasn't right to gatekeep the spiritually and practices of ""her people"" just because they MIGHT have originated with them, and that these things call to people from all walks of life. 

She argued with me, and ended up making a post asking for support and calling me racist because I told her I didn't believe she was actually Indian and didn't support her rude behaviour. 

My group ripped her apart 😂 Excepting a few other ""native Americans"" (only one I actually know is genuinely Indian) who said I was in the wrong. I didn't want politics or gatekeeping in my group. We are a space for positivity and kindness, not limiting and racially segregating. That's the true racism. I am an advocate for humans to be one race and to care for one another regardless of skin tone. 

I banned her and her defenders from my group, and made a firm rule against what she was advocating for. We will be non divisive. 

Well, she messaged me and sent me paragraphs on paragraphs explaining to me (in a way I felt patronizing, she assumed I knew nothing) her perspective and trying to ""educate"" me. I blocked her. 

I'm now receiving people attempting to join my group and deface my name as well as harass my group members and make my sanctuary into a chaotic place of negativity for no real reason. That leads me to believe that she posted screenshots somewhere. 

So tell me, am I REALLY the asshole? I think I might be the asshole because so many are now against me and making me feel awful for something that shouldn't have been an issue to begin with.

EDIT: I'll check back for the general consensus in a few hours once this group of reactionary and sensitive people passes... It's not fair how I'm being treated over this and I feel like a lot of you are just trolling me for being white.",2020-11-18 02:55:33,334,118,0.65,121,0,2,0,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have 3 daughters. Oldest (Ava, 18) middle (Emma, 16) and youngest (Lily, 12).  Ava and Lily are both very talkative and social. Emma used to be like that when she was little. We used to call her CNN because she’d tell everyone everything. If she heard me say I gained 5 pounds she’d tell grandma. If we bought someone a gift she’d tell them the price, where, and when we got it. She told us to stop calling her that but we felt it wasn’t a big deal. 

Eventually she stopped talking so much and started staying in her room all day. She leaves for school then goes straight to her room when she gets home and won’t come out until dinner. I want her to be more outgoing and talkative like her sisters and her sisters, my husband, and I started telling her she needs to get out of her room. It was to the point where she’d sleep at her grandparents house and none of us would notice. 

Over quarantine she never left her room except for food, water, and to get to the bathroom. We asked her why she never comes out to hang out with us and she said her sisters are loud and obnoxious and she doesn’t like to be around them. We felt that was very rude and grounded her. Her sisters are loud and like to do things like loudly sing or yell songs and play rap music (which Emma hates but she sings musical songs in her room so we feel it’s about even) but they’re not doing anything to her. 

Emma went to sleep at her grandparents house on Wednesday and while she was gone I locked the door to her room (I have the only key. When Emma came back and couldn’t get into her room I told her she was going to hang out with us. She was furious. She called her grandparents to pick her up and hasn’t spoken to me since.

Edit: I realized the timeline wasn’t too clear. Everyone’s saying she’s quiet because she’s a teenager but she’s been quiet and reserved since she was probably 8. 

And she’s allowed to go to her grandparents house whenever she wants. She still talks to them but refuses to talk to us. She’s been staying at their house since Wednesday.

And people are saying to learn about her interests. She loves musical theater. We all think it’s annoying and hate the songs and refuse to watch the videos and don’t talk about it.

Update: Emma’s grandpa came today to get the rest of Emma’s clothes and her medicines. He told us she’s trying to get emancipated and they’ve uninvited us from thanksgiving. I hope y’all are happy now.",2020-11-21 23:54:13,215,151,0.71,105,0,1,0,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's going to be a cultural wedding with people flying in from Nigeria; if you know anything about Nigerian (and other cultural) weddings, they're close to impossible to do on the cheap but we're going to do what we can to make it a positive and authentic experience without living beyond our means.

My fiancé's side is Nigerian and is willing to help out with some of the costs. It's super kind of them, not asked of them, and not expected of them. Nor is it ""traditional"" for the groom's side to help out, although in 2020 tradition is mostly irrelevant even if there are cultural dynamics in play. 

I never asked my parents for any financial contribution to the wedding, but I did reach out to my mom recently to confirm she's not paying a dime. We need to set a serious budget so costs don't balloon. When I got engaged she adopted this silly ""joking"" tone about how she had to clothe and feed my siblings and I for XX years so she's not going to pay a dime for our wedding. 

I chatted with her recently and it's the same tone - no contribution, it's apparently comical that I even brought it up, and she has no problem being transparent with my MIL that they're not helping. 

No problem! I'm not entitled to anything - just wanted to confirm that she's indeed serious and okay with the other side knowing that. 

I'm actively planning out stuff with my MIL and my mom has asked a few questions, like how things are going, what venue we're interested in, etc. I don't want to share in the planning with her.

My buddy Leah's been single for about three years now and is trying out Hinge.  I noticed that she tends to pass on the more ""masculine"" looking guys. Like, she'll message the more skinny, feminine looking dudes and skip over the bigger guys or dudes with beards or body hair.  Not to judge her, but guys are going to look like guys and she's going to be single for a long ass time if she keeps swiping on guys just because she doesn't want to date a lumberjack. 

Well, I set her up with my friend Alex recently.  They have a lot of things in common, even if he looks like a biker with a shaved head and beard combo.  Only their date didn't go so well.  Alex admitted he wasn't attracted to Leah, but Leah blew up on me and told me to never pull that kind of stunt on her again.

Me, getting pissed on Alex's behalf because he's my best friend and she blew him off on their date, told her, ""well if you're so hung up on femme guys, why don't you start dating women instead?""

I honestly don't know what I did wrong because now Leah, Alex, and a bunch of our other friends are pissed at me.  Some of them say that who Leah is attracted to is no one's business but her own and others because they think I'm trying to force her to be a lesbian.  Meanwhile, I think Leah needs to get over her hangup over big guys with beards because we live in fucking Portland, Oregon and it's lumberjack/hipster/bear type central up here.  

Is that really an asshole move?

Edit: Okay, fine.  I'm an asshole.  I'll go apologize to Leah if she'll have me.  Not my fault if she's going to be forever alone.",2020-11-23 01:47:58,242,68,0.62,78,0,1,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She divorced my father when I was a teenager, but I chose to stay mostly with her because dad was not too good to us. I am now 23, living alone and I visit her every time I get the chance. She's always been a good friend to me, but there's something that has always bothered me about her. You see... I am a Christian man and she's always been into rock music, she dresses almost always in black, in men's clothes, she wears chains, necklaces, bracelets, skulls, you name it.  In her spare time, she likes to paint disturbing pictures with blood and gore and lots of profanity, which she kept from me until a few years ago. She has several trinkets around the house too, I recently learned that one of them is a statue of Baphomet. I've always tried to guide her in the right direction, to help her see the light, to read about God, but she ignores me every time. It's like trying to talk to a teenager that is stuck in the goth phase and I don't know how to approach her anymore. 

Forward to two days ago, I visited her like usual and confronted her about the statue and her ""preferences"". She just told me that that's just how she likes to express herself and, about the statue, that she's a satanist. I was baffled and hurt and she noticed it, so she explained me what it was all about, that she's an atheist and got ""unbaptized"", then turned to satanism to be ""her own god"". Each explanation was worse than the other. That day I also leanred that I am not baptized, I asked her why and she told me that she wanted me to choose what to follow when I grew up instead of forcing any beliefs on me. While it makes sense, I felt betrayed. Most of my friends wre baptized when they were babies, so I felt like my own mom set me up to be a heretic or something. I told her that I am worried about her future and I feel unheard... but she got upset and told me to respect people's choices. I said that I only wanted her to be more normal and maybe dad left because he was also tired like me (he is a christian too). She got very angry and told me to leave her house and not come back until I quit my ""judgemental crap"".

Not like completely in your face, women are less than men sexist but still a sexist. He believes in a lot of gender role bs and can occasionally make shitty sexist jokes that he says are”jUsT jOkEs!” Surprising because he is only 26 and grew up on a much more left area of the US. I knew he was like this but I thought he was just being immature and having bad taste in jokes and would out grow it. And because I loved him for everything else. Well we have twin 6 year old daughters and a 4 year old boy. And he Is still the same way. I decided that I would have to do something about this that would fix my husbands stupid views. So I told my husband that I will be giving him a bunch of material on feminism/sexism/gender roles and that I will be quizzing him on the material. If he doesn’t pass(and trust me, it isn’t difficult material. Only way for him to fail would be for him to not actually read the stuff) or refuses to partake I told them that”We will have serious problems.” 

We got through one test and he barely passed. Sigh. He asked me how many more of these we will do and I told him until I felt comfortable in his knowledge and saw an improvement in his words and actions. He threw a bit of a tantrum here “You got to be kidding me. You’re giving me quizzes over here like I’m a fucking child. I’m not sexist.” Well I tell him his actions say differently and remind him of the consequences. He huffs and puffs and  says this is all so stupid before getting up. I obviously didn’t like his reaction to this. It’s safe to say he didn’t get any that night or the following morning. I told him his next test would be in two days and he rolled his eyes.

Blair’s birth father is unknown to her, and says her step-father or his family never treated her like a member of their family, but I think she’s being dramatic! Blair certainly accepted the countless birthday and Christmas gifts from her birth mother and step-father over the years. 

In the obituary, Blair asked if she could be listed as her grandfather’s daughter because he was the only real father she knew. This pissed me off because I think Blair just wants attention and I find this disrespectful to my mother and my aunt. I was trying to discuss this with another cousin and accidentally sent a text message to Blair saying “Can you believe Blair wants to be listed as a daughter in Grandpa’s obituary?” 

Now I’m getting passive aggressive text messages from Blair and my grandmother about how I have no consideration for my cousin’s feelings.

Both of our names are on the lease, just so you guys know. I have two younger siblings, one who is irrelevant to the story and Sara (19F). 

Sara recently asked me if she could move in with my boyfriend and I because our parents were being 'unreasonable'. I talked with my boyfriend, he agreed, and she moved in about two weeks ago. 

Things have been fine, although I have noticed that my boyfriend has started to avoid my sister at all costs. My sister said that this makes her feel bad, so I sat my boyfriend down and told him to stop because it was upsetting to my sister. But I noticed that he hasn't stopped. 

Today, I arrived home and my boyfriend and sister were arguing. I got between them and demanded to know what was wrong. My boyfriend started talking about how my sister had made 'unwanted advances' towards him and was 'peeping' in on him while he was changing. My sister was close to tears and denied the allegations. 

I could tell that my sister was upset, and she is NOT a liar, so I told my boyfriend that until I made up my mind on who to trust, then he was going to have to stay at a friend's house while I sorted out my feelings. He got angry and said that it was his apartment first, so I had no right to kick him out. 

I threatened to leave with my sister if he didn't, and that deemed to knock the sense into him. He packed a bag and left, probably to a friend's house, while I sat down with my sister, but she still denied anything. 

I called my boyfriend to tell him that I needed for him to stay away for a few days while I got everything sorted our and he just went off, yelling about how I had no right and that my sister was in the wrong until I just hung up because I didn't want to fight. 

But the longer we go without talking, the more I feel bad for kicking him out.

We met in college and are in our late twenties now.  

He's been a great boyfriend, albeit a bit immature for his age but it's something I've learned to deal with.  My biggest problem is how he dresses. 

I'm going to get so much shit for this, but I hate how my boyfriend dresses.  He still wears the same baggy anime t-shirts and sweatpants and baggy jeans from when we first met.  Everything he owns doesn't fit him properly and some of his shirts are starting to have holes in them.  This isn't an issue with him because he works from home and hasn't really left the house since March.

I honestly feel more self conscious being around him.  We had a Zoom meetup with some friends recently and I couldn't help but notice how put together everyone was.  None of the guys were wearing t-shirts.  Their hair neat and they looked like they were taking care of themselves.  Meanwhile, Gerald was wearing the same Nartuo shirt he's been wearing for the last week and had a five o'clock shadow and his hair was really shaggy and looked like he needed to run a comb through it.  Next to them, he still looked the same as in his high school photos.

I've been trying to get him to update his wardrobe but he's won't budge on the issue.  He likes what he wears and doesn't see the point in changing how he looks when he's going to be working from home indefinetly.  He also pointed out if he had extra money, he'd be spending it on collectibles or games instead of clothes.

So for his birthday, I got him a $500 giftcard to a clothing store.  Gerald was pissed when he opened the envelope and saw the card and not the game he wanted.  We got into a fight and now I've been staying with a friend for the last couple of days.  He doesn't want to update his clothes, and thinks I am a bitch for dictating what he can and can't wear.  Meanwhile, I just want a boyfriend who can act and dress his age.  I love him, but I don't want to date a version of him that still looks and acts the same as when we were college freshmen.  

So, AITA for getting my boyfriend a gift card to a clothing store instead of video games?

Edit: I think I really need to emphasize this.  Most of his clothes, if not all, have holes or stains on them.  He once spent a week wearing a shirt with this huge hole in the armpit.  He once went to the store wearing sweatpants with a hole large enough you could see his boxers.

And while we're at it, there is no way in hell I'm getting him a stupid game after his Among Us tantrum.

My sister has always been a very career-driven woman and before she fell pregnant, she was working as a lawyer. Her husband works from home due to Covid.

Recently, my sister has been complaining to me and my mom that she feels like her baby doesn't like her and likes her husband more. I actually think this is true since when we've visited them, the baby always fusses when my sister's holding her and immediately shuts up when her husband takes her. She's been crawling and will never crawl towards my sister, always her husband. She'll talk to the baby, but she barely registers her (she just stares blankly or starts showing signs of distress). Meanwhile, the baby is always cooing happily and babbling around her dad.

Now, I'm not saying that my sister dislikes her baby, but I think she severely underestimated how big of a commitment having a child was. She had a host of physical problems during her pregnancy. She also had a difficult labor and first month. Her baby was a big crier and would apparently would wake her 5-6 times a night. After a month, my sister cited that she would go back to work since she was feeling extremely suffocated at home and that she was hated being nagged by the baby constantly. Her and her husband worked this out so she started going back to work at the firm while he took care of the baby during a big chunk of the day. They've kept this up since.

Personally, I think it's very normal that the baby is exhibiting signs of liking her father more and coldness towards my sister. She hasn't been there for her baby and they haven't had time to form a strong attachment bond. So when my sister was complaining again at a family dinner last week, I told her ""I think you should stop complaining because I think this behavior is normal given \[the reasons I stated above\]. It's your fault that your baby likes \[dad\] more because you chose your career over spending more time with your child. You chose to go back to work to avoid spending time with her because you find her annoying."" Well, she did not take that well and actually started crying at the dinner table.

She has always had problems with anxiety, but I honestly didn't realize that this would be a problem. I regret doing that and see now that it was cruel, but I can't redo the past. By the time she had recovered, gotten her makeup redone, and gotten through vows, there was time for either pictures or signing the marriage license.

The next day didn't happen as it was the weekend, but neither did the next week. We had to delay our honeymoon to take her to the hospital for severe stomach pain.

Together, they make significantly more money than I do, and they’ve been mentors to me at various points in my career. Both are conventionally attractive and aware that I’m bisexual.

We used to go out to dinner once a week and talk about work as well as personal stuff. I’ve also been to their house several times, and have babysat their kids. However, since the pandemic started, we’ve just been Zooming once a week instead. I enjoy socializing with them and consider them to be among my closest friends.

On a recent call, however, they said they wanted to discuss the possibility of “something more serious than friendship.”

I immediately got angry. I said that, even though I’m bi, I’m neither a prostitute nor a toy, and I’m certainly not down for threesomes. They said, “No, no, that’s not what we mean,” then told me they were looking a long-term relationship, not a threesome.

I told them that, even if I were down for a polyamorous relationship, it was still unfair of them to expect me to enter a relationship where power is distributed unequally (after all, they’re much wealthier than I am and have been married for a decade, meaning every decision would be them against me). I told them to go fuck themselves and ended the call.

Since then, Jennifer has texted me several times and her husband has texted me once. I haven’t answered. I’m still angry about this, but now I worry I overreacted. Was I being an AH or what? Should I have been more polite?

Anyway, every year for our birthday the three of us always have a special gathering. Usually it’s themed. This year we are turning 20 and Hannah and I want to celebrate by taking a 2 month road trip. Going to several states, camping, and enjoying nature.
Because of Graces physical delays it would be impossible for her to go with us. We plan to have a small dinner at home then head out our trip.  Grace doesn’t know about it. I know she would want to go. 
We’ve been on a few “hiking” trips with her but my sister and I want to do something more intense. 
But would we be assholes if we celebrated without her?

We ended up telling Grace about the road trip today . And she went into her regular rant. She told mom and dad that we can’t go. Grace doesn’t want to join on the hiking she called it “only for (homophobic slur)but she doesn’t want us to copy her trip (Grace and her friends did a similar trip two years go for our birthday)

She called us the usual bad names. Insulted Hannah by using homophobic slurs(Hannah is bisexual)

We told her that she could join us for the hospital thing but she said she would come only if she can bring her friends and boyfriend 

Now Mom and Dad are working on booking tickets for them to (probably) meet us for the trip

This weekend, my aunt came to visit. This was the first time she was meeting my husband besides very briefly at our wedding. 

Before he came home I pulled her aside and asked that she not let anything slip about the fact I have a 12 year old daughter out there. 

She was shocked I never told him and said that it was unfair to him. I got pretty pissed and reminded my aunt that after my ex contacted me several times through the years, he had finally said he never wanted to deal with me again.

And that to want me to drag up inconvenient pieces of information regarding a mistake I had made in my past was insensitive. 

I asked why she would try to ruin both my marriage and my working relationship with my husband when we all have things from the past we’d like to change. 

AITA? My aunt is upset with me but says she won’t rock the boat.",2020-10-11 21:06:47,737,1993,0.88,317,0,1,0,,1,,,,1,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m recently retired and my husband passed away 10 years ago. Finances wise, I do enough to keep myself happy, but I don’t have a ton of money or assets at all. 

Anyways, I have two older sons who are now in their 30s who got married 3-5 years ago. They both married women from fairly wealthy families. So their weddings were all very extravagant in the 70-90k range. Imagine 250 people weddings in the center of a big city. 

Now, my youngest is 26 and getting married next year. Her fiancé is still in graduate school and his parents are just middle class. They said they can’t contribute because they’re in quite a lot of debt as well. I can’t contribute anything beyond a few thousand dollars. 

A few nights ago my daughter called me crying. She said she’s upset thinking about how little they have to pay for this wedding, and it’s worse knowing her brothers had these amazing events and she’ll only have a dinky, backyard thing. She said her dream was to have the kind of grand wedding her brothers had but she would walk the aisle this time. She asked me if I thought she was a failure in life and it just broke my heart. 

So yesterday I called my sons and asked them to consider paying the bulk of their sister’s wedding so she can have a beautiful one like they did. Immediately they start giving excuses so I got mad and told them this isn’t how they treat family and to think of their baby sister and the wedding she should deserve. 

AITA for asking? They are both doing very well in life and lucked out in not having to pay for their own weddings. I felt like it would be more than reasonable to chip in for their baby sister’s wedding, who does not have the same privileges as them but still deserves the same as them.",2020-10-12 22:59:37,693,1836,0.9,301,4,4,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
