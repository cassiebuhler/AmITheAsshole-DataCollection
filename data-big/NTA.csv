We're both vegans, and although we don't judge those who are not vegan, we wanted to serve vegan food at our wedding. We found a vegan caterer.

When we sent out invitations, we added a note saying that the food will be vegan. We also asked that everyone who has any specific dietary requirements let us know. The note made it clear that anyone who needed a specific diet would be catered for. 

Soon after the invitations went out, my aunt phoned us in a huff. My uncle does not want vegan food; he needs to eat meat, she said. I asked what his dietary requirements are, thinking that he has a specific medical condition and cannot eat a vegan meal. She said his reasons are ""cultural"" and he must eat meat. I said that's not really a good enough reason, we all come from the same culture and it's not like it's a sin to not eat meat with every single meal. 

I explained to her that I wouldn't really mind him eating meat but 1) it means I'll have to bring in a new caterer for one meal, which will be expensive and 2) I don't want to pay for meat if I don't have to. Again, I'm not judging non-vegans, but it doesn't sit right with me. 

Weeks went by. The only people who had dietary requirements were three cousins, who eat a low-carb diet. My vegan caterer came up with vegan, low-carb meals, and my cousins were happy with this plan. Upon hearing this, my aunt phoned me again, angrier this time, asking why my uncle can't be catered for because he ""doesn't like"" vegan food.

I refused again. I told her that the food consists of things I KNOW he eats anyway: vegetables, coconut, nuts, etc. I went through a list of ingredients I knew would be in the food and she admitted he has no intolerances/allergies to any of that stuff. What's the big deal with him skipping meat one time? I told her that if he's so adamant about the meat he can buy himself McDonalds and eat it at the kiddy table.

Now my aunt isn't talking to me, and is instead talking shit about me to all my family members. I told her that they are welcome to simply not attend the wedding if they're going to bitch about the food.

I understand that veganism is not possible or sustainable for many people in the long-term but come on - it's ONE meal, that is FREE. 

AITA? I don't want to seem like a ""pushy vegan"" but I also don't want to pay for meat unless I have to. Again, it's one meal out of their whole life.",2020-11-25 07:50:47,3024,23421,0.92,1,0,65,0,1,25,20,21,21,1,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Someone else always hosts (we typically help ""sponsor"" the host by paying for clean-up, etc, our home is just too small to host the 30+ folks who typically show up through the day). This year that's obviously not happening.

Other than us talking about not doing the usual, Thanksgiving didn't come up until yesterday. My kids have the week off from online school, and I was doing a puzzle with them before dinner when my husband walks in after work and says: ""So did we get a turkey?""

I looked at him and said ""Well, I know I didn't. Did you?""

He stared at me blankly and said ""No. What do you mean? Do we need to get one still? Is it being delivered?""

I shrugged and said ""I don't know nothing about no turkey.""

The kids and he looked so confused, so I helped them along and said ""I didn't buy anything. I didn't plan anything. No one said anything to me about Thanksgiving. Nobody offered to help meal plan, cook anything, do anything.""

He blew up yelling at me about how I should have obviously known.

I said, why? I've literally never planned or made a Thanksgiving dinner in my life. The most I've ever done was help clean up or maybe peel the potato. I asked him why didn't ***HE*** plan anything, why didn't the kids plan anything? Why is everyone waiting until the last minute and dumping it on me?

He just sputtered and yelled and stormed off to his ""office"" and left me with the kids. We all had dinner, the kids cleaned up, and I was relaxing with some wine and a book after they all went to bed. My husband tore into me about how he can't believe I left this all to the last minute, now there will be no Thanksgiving, how could I know be heartbroken to do this to the kids, etc.

So I just looked at him and said ""Why didn't you plan? Why did you wait to the last minute to ask me?""

He told me I was being a fucking bitch for no reason and stomped off to go sleep in his office. He left without saying a word this morning. I followed up with my kids and asked them if they wanted Thanksgiving. They said they didn't care because the food isn't that good most of the time anyway.

Before you ask, yup, I work as well. We split chores but there's no hardline. I do some, he does some. We both cook, and the oldest cooks as well. I just don't get why Thanksgiving is on my plate. Why, just because I'm a woman? Lmao fuck that.

AITA?

**ETA:** Thanks for the judgments, all. A lot of people seem to think that my kids are like, toddlers or something. They're old enough to help make the menu for dinners, help with cooking, etc. It's weird how many people came up with info here, like I was ""getting down on the floor playing"" rather than me and the kids... sitting at the table doing a puzzle.

Anyway, I told my husband that if he wants to do some traditional Thanksgiving with all the fattening, carby, salty, beige food, he can go ahead and plan it and I'll help in the same capacity as always. If he wants me and the kids to cook something together (aka a normal, average Thursday) I'll continue with what was scheduled.

The kids genuinely do not care. Thanksgiving doesn't mean anything to them. One of them has been asking for us to stay home for years. One of them barely touches the food as it, and the other one only likes to go so she can see her cousins, and she sees them all the time anyway. The middle kid already dug out another puzzle for us and they're just happy they're off school.

Also, we don't do Christmas.

2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jx90uv/aita_for_leaving_my_husband_in_the_grocery_store/,AITA for leaving my husband in the grocery store because he started acting like a toddler?,"We all go through phases and pick up annoying habits, and sometimes we just need our loved ones to gently tell us if we've picked up a particularly egregious habit.

Sometime in the last year, my husband has picked up a habit where he talks like a baby. At first it was funny, but passed into embarrassing, cringeworthy behavior quickly.

Examples: doggo, pupper, woofer/subwoofer, pibble, hooty-boy, peepo, birb, meowmeow, sammy, sammiches, sammywhammy, chicky nuggies, chicky tendies, adding a toddleresque ""lisp"" to words, and the ones that really get gross are childish euphemisms for genitalia or sex.

I cannot emphasize this enough: it is not endearing or sexy to have my husband talk about my ""boobies"" and his ""weiner"" and ""weenie"" and ""wee wee"", ""hoohas"" and ""bajingos"" (Nostalgia for Scrubs be damned). We have not had sex for six months because he cannot stop talking about my ""boobies"" and it makes me sick.

Just before the pandemic hit, we were out at a restaurant with some friends, he actually ordered a ""chicky sammy"" like, said that exact phrase. Chicky. Sammy. Look, it's totally fine that he ordered the chicken sandwich. That's not the issue. Our friends noticed the baby talk, because he insisted on continuing the ""joke"" and even started talking with this god awful toddler... lilt? Accent?

After that, I just couldn't stomach the idea of going out with him to adult places. I'd go out to the brewery with friends, but god forbid he join me and say ""Me wanty 'nother beer!"" or something.

I don't know where it came from. I don't know why he's doing this. I finally hit my limit when we were grocery shopping and everything seemed normal and fine until he gasped like a kid, ran to the ice cream section and jumped up and down yelling ""ICE CWEAM ICE CWEAM! I WANT CHOCWIT!""

I was *MORTIFIED*. People were staring at him and me. He kept going and kept saying ""CAN WE GET POPSICOOOS?"" and I just said ""Either talk to me like an adult or I'm leaving.""

He started saying OOOOOO YOU MUST BE FUN AT PARTIES and LIGHTEN UP, WILL YOU? And shit like that. I just said fuck it, and left the store, leaving him to walk home (like a mile, it was fine) because I couldn't even look at him.

Since then, things have been very tense, and he keeps telling me that he wants an apology for embarrassing him by leaving him in the store. I told him that people don't get to demand apologies, if someone wants to apologize, it's up to them, and I am absolutely not going to apologize for saving myself the embarrassment of a 35 year old man with a mortgage and retirement account asking for ""CHOCWIT ICE CWEAM.""

He got his fucking Mom involved, no joke. She keeps telling me it's just a phase and that he's probably bored and I should be happy this is his midlife crisis, rather than him fucking 19 year olds at the local bar.

I'm going crazy. AITA? Do I really just need to let my husband continuously embarrass me like this?

**Edit:** Sorry, there was only so much space. I *have* talked to him. Multiple times. Especially about the sexual comments. I've made it extremely, abundantly clear that him using terms like ""boobies"" and ""wee wee"" are absolutely *repulsive* to me, among other things he says.

**INFO:** Does he have a job? Yes, and he acts completely normal as far as I know. He worked from home for a while during lockdown, and I never heard him talk like this to anyone he worked with. 

**Does he do it with friends?** Sometimes, and it's generally meant to annoy them or gross them out, but he stops. He has friends where they think its ""cute"" to embarrass each other. 

**Is this a kink/fetish?:** If so, I'm absolutely done. (Edited because it was offensive)

**Has he seen a doctor?**: No, but I've asked him if he needed to talk to someone because he was acting strange, and he accused me of being stuck up and judgmental. Given that he doesn't act like this with his coworkers, or his family, and only jokes around with his friends, I'm willing to bet that this is an indication that he's trying to force this fetish on me nonconsensually, or trying to get me to leave.

**Is it a tumor?**: I don't know. Like I said above, I asked him if he needed to see someone. I can't force him (even if I want to, just find out if there's any way we can salvage this), but after this post closes I will try to get him to. Maybe his sister can encourage him, even though he acts completely normal around them.

**Does he have childhood trauma?:** As far as I know, and I'm relatively close to his family and would likely know, the most traumatic thing he had happen was a minor car accident when he was around 13 years old. No injuries, no death, etc. He hasn't been in a car accident in the past two years or anything like that, and I haven't, and AFAIK no one else in his family has been, etc.

**I want to send you a chat instead of my comment getting lost**: Please don't. I've had a number of people repost this to make fun of me because I didn't respond the way they wanted, etc. Just comment, I can at least to respond to those and help others get an idea of what's going on.",2020-11-19 19:08:36,4114,23962,0.95,0,0,67,0,1,17,16,9,19,,30,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k1z30n/aita_for_being_too_honest_about_why_i_dont_drink/,AITA for being “too honest” about why I don’t drink?,"I’m 33 and I had a serious drinking problem since a young age. My dad was an alcoholic so booze never lacked in our house. It nearly killed me when I was only 27 and was in the ER for alcohol poisoning. 
It was too close a call and after that things had to change. With my wife’s support, I went to rehab and proud to say I’ve been sober 5 1/2yrs. 

My flatmate invited our friends over yesterday. It was 7 of us in total, including his friend, “Mark.” I’ve met Mark maybe 3-4 times over the last 2 years and while we’re “friendly” i honestly don’t know him that well. But you can tell he’s a party-guy. Likes to get loud, take shots, makes gross comments sometimes, etc.

Mark brought several cases of beer and a bottle of tequila with him so everyone was drinking and having a good time. 

Mark kept offering me drinks the entire night, which I’d politely decline. It’s like he made it his personal mission to get me to drink by egging me on, saying everytime he sees me I’m either drinking a soda/water and it’s okay to let loose sometimes. He resorted to teasing me into drinking, calling me “princess”; I don’t know what that had to do with not wanting to drink.

All my friends there knew what I was like before, how bad my drinking was so they kept trying to steer the conversation so he’d forget about me. But every now and then he’d hand me a shot glass or a beer and would not let it go even after telling him yet again that I didn’t want to drink. 

My wife became uncomfortable with his behavior (I think she was worried I’d actually drink). She grabbed the shot glass from me, dumped it in the sink and told him to stop it already. He looked between us and grinned like he “understood now”. 

Mark joked that maybe we should get my wife drunk first, then that’ll get her to loosen up the leash she has on me. I’ll admit, that made me see red. I got in his face and told him, “actually I don’t drink because last time I did I almost f*cking died so unless you want me puking everywhere and having seizures you should shut up and leave my wife out of this.”

Wiped the smile off him real quick and he apologized. The rest of night went on and he finally left me alone. 

Our flatmate did confront me in the morning because he thinks I was too honest with Mark and it wasn’t his fault he didn’t know; he was just joking around and I made him feel bad. Our other friends agree he was being too pushy and deserved being told off, my wife agrees so he’s the only one right now that’s taking Mark’s side.

He said I could’ve ignored him until he gave up instead of bringing up an uncomfortable truth from my past. 

Now yes I could’ve just told Mark the truth without full details but felt that’s none of his business and a “no” should’ve been enough. 

I only got carried away when he decided to include my wife in his jokes. So yes I am wondering if I was a bit of an a-hole for what I told him instead of keeping the peace.",2020-11-27 10:52:39,2138,22008,0.93,1,0,166,0,,6,8,6,11,,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While I was there, I was window shopping and saw that they had a computer for $89. I only really use a computer for youtube or websites and my laptop is pretty old so I tested this computer, everything worked so I bought it. The next day, I got a call and it was from the manager of the shop. He was very rude from the start and told me that the computer was labeled incorrectly and told me(didn't ask, rudely ordered me) to come in that day and either A.) return the computer or B.) pay the difference. I asked that the difference was and he said over $800. I guess it was supposed to be labeled $899. 

&#x200B;

I said I'd think about it and he said that if I wasn't in by the end of the day, he'd just charge my card the amount. I told him that he can't do that and he said if I didn't bring it in, or pay the difference, he was gonna ban me from the store and also call the police for theft. I just said I'd thnk about it again. I think he was mad cause the last thing he said to me was ""listen, b\*\*\*ch, either bring it in or go to jail, your choice"". Or ""you decide"". Something like that. Then ended the call. I don't think the police can even do anything cause the price sticker is still on the computer and I have a receipt of the transaction for the $89 and there's probably also camera footage of me buying it and he must have a record of the purchase too. 

&#x200B;

It's not my fault that him or an employee labeled it incorrectly and it's not like I knew it was a wrong price when I bought it. I just saw a cheap computer that worked and bought it. I asked my friend who's into computers to look at it and see if it's actually worth that much or if this guy's just trying to scam me or something and he said that the parts are pretty high end and expensive. I don't think I did anything wrong but my friend said that I should take it back so idk.",2020-11-24 01:09:32,2340,20196,0.97,0,0,64,1,,5,6,1,3,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k2flj8/aita_for_having_kicked_my_dil_out_of_my/,AITA for having kicked my DIL out of my Thanksgiving meal after her vegan feast fiasco?,"My daughter (21) lives with us while finishing college. My son (27) lives in the same city and I babysit his children (3 and 4), so we are bubbled. My sister, who drove three hours with her husband and son (16) to come and see us, has been taking extra precautions prior to this event. Everyone was safe.

DIL and I don't get along for many reasons I won't go into. She's also just one of those condescending people who thinks that constantly looks down on others, especially because of her veganism. Last Thanksgiving, she raised hell over me making a turkey, and claimed there weren't really any vegan options. There were.

Last week, DIL contacts me on FB asking for the ""menu"", and then telling me what ""will"" and ""won't"" work. She also sent me many replication recipes  to make for her, with expensive specialty items in all of them, many I didn't even know what they were. This annoyed me, because I had already made sure to give my son, her, and her kids vegan options for the day, but it wasn't good enough. I finally just told her to go pound sand, and that she could bring her own dish for her family if she'd be that picky.

Thanksgiving happens. They arrive late with a *ton* of food dishes, parading them in, all with this vindictive grin on her face. Turns out, she, out of spite, took the *exact* menu, and made her own version of every single dish. Needless to say, I was livid, but I held my tongue. My sister and daughter in particular did try the food and enjoy it. Every time they complimented her, she would give me this look as she received her thanks, before tacking on something like ""I just wanted to make a Thanksgiving meal that *everyone* could enjoy.""

The part where I finally snapped was at dessert. We have a family tradition where right before we sit down and say what we're thankful for. Its usually for family, or being able to gather. When at her turn, she got the same smug, vindictive grin on her face, and in the most condescending way, said ""I'm thankful for starting the *new* tradition of a cruelty free, inclusive Thanksgiving, and I hope it continues next year!""

Reddit, I saw red. I waited until my turn, and then said, as calmly as I could, that I was thankful that this would be the last Thanksgiving I'd be spending with her.  It took them a moment to catch on, and soon enough nasty words were being exchanged on both sides. I finally kicked them out.

I didn't think about it until this evening, when my son sent me a text telling me that he would not be letting his children come over until I personally apologize to his wife. He said that while he sees my side, she ""didn't mean it"", and that I took it way too far by publicly embarrassing her, when she spent so much time making food for everyone.  My husband is telling me I should just apologize, because it was rude of me and isn't worth it. He doesn't really get why it hurt me so much that she copied my meal to ""one up"" me, and thinks the more food, the merrier.

AITA here? Let me know.

&#x200B;

Edit for info: word count is limiting!

I absolutely had vegan options for them to begin with. I had an entree for them (plus some backup nuggets for the kdis), a few side dishes (most were vegan with nonvegan addons), and a dessert that I made. She told me that those were fine, but the other entrees ""wouldn't work"" and that I needed to make them all vegan. It wasn't a request to make something in particular, it was a demand that I redo everything. My son let it slip that she spent ""hundreds of dollars"" on the food to make what she did, and he seemed to blame me for that.

Another note is that although the threat of the grandchildren hurts every time, it isn't the first time. Last time she made it two weeks and gave in, because they rely on the free child care four times a week while she's working.

I did not literally tell her to go pound sand. That is an expression. I told her that was the menu, and it will not be changed, but she was welcome to bring her own dish for her family.

**Another edit:**

Wow! This really blew up! I have a mini update. I've spoken with my husband, and I've told him that I flatout feel unappreciated. I spent *days* making this meal, and for him, who watched me struggle, to blow it off as nothing was honestly hurtful. I additionally reminded him of the other issues we've had, and have informed that I'm no longer going to be taking this from her *or* my son. He is welcome to talk to them if he likes, but I, personally, am done. I am done being their free labor. I am done being her punching bag and power step. I am done just all around. We talked it a bit more, and he respects my choice and has apologized for his part in this.

Next, I told my son that if he wants to continue to try and manipulate me with his grandchildren, then I think its best we cut contact for a while, because I'm beyond hurt. I have explained my side to him (in tears), and it was met with an ""I know, but"". I just told him to stop. He gets free childcare. Its manipulative. He claims he isn't a part of it and its just his wife and ""I know how she is"", but I'm realizing that he's actually a huge part of it for enabling. I've told him that I'm always there for his children, but that for now, I'd rather not have contact with them unless there's a dire emergency with no other options, or they *both* apologized, and that includes the consistent free labor. His response was that I was making it difficult, because his wife would be upset if he apologized to me. That solidified my decision, and I've cut contact.

My daughter is aware of what is happening. She's taken my side on this.

**PLEASE DO NOT SEND ME HATE DMS ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL OPINION OVER ME NOT BEING VEGAN. YOU WILL SIMPLY BE REPORTED AND BLOCKED. I WILL NOT BE ANSWERING.

I was raised in foster care, and so my friends are my family. I met my late husband in college. He was just raised by his mother, who had abandoned him and later died (no adoptive family). As an adult, I've looked into both trees and our biological ancestors are, to put it mildly, really dangerous people and/or dead. My late husband and older son died in a car crash.

My daughter is in kindergarten and she, more accurately me, was supposed to do a family tree project for school. I tried speaking to her teacher that this was not going to be a Pollyanna report, but she is one of those people that can't comprehend that sometimes family is a dark subject, and insisted that it needed to be biological. So, I did it.

Some of them, like her father and my son, I have actual information for aside from that they're dead. But for most of my family and her paternal family, I literally only have birth date, death date, when they would have had their kids, and cemetery information, unless they were cremated.

It was supposed to have 10 pictures, but most of the pictures I have of any ancestors are just headstones. I made a trip when my husband and I first married to take pictures of the headstones, so I included those in there. I only have 3 pictures total of my biological family, and most of them are group shots where I could only label maybe 3 people. I don't have any pictures of my late husband's family from before me and my kids, but I put some of the old ones in there too.

So while the other kids had long family trees, my daughter was basically introducing the concept of death to her kindergarten class. Now I'm getting slammed with calls from other parents, the teacher, and the principal. They're appalled that I allowed such a ""morbid"" report and are saying I traumatized their children. I don't think I did anything wrong. They wanted a report on her biological ancestors, I gave it, and kept it G-rated. I just didn't lie that people were alive when they weren't. I don't raise her to think that death is taboo or something to be ashamed of anyway. Death is part of life. Most of her/my family is dead, so talking about family just means talking about death, and it's just something you have to accept.

Not too long ago, one of my close friends who also recently had a child approached me to tell me that my sister is in a mothers group on Facebook and she's posting photos of Kaia and she's calling my daughter HERS and she's also calling her by a different name. My friend sent me screenshots of my sister's posts and I was completely disturbed so I spoke to my fiancé and we both decided we had to take action immediately. I went over to my sister's and asked her directly about what she was posting on Facebook, she did not deny it and also had no explanation.

I was in public today when a small girl (maybe 5?) asked me what happened to my leg. I whispered “I’m secretly a robot, shhh, don’t tell anyone.” Her eyes went real wide and she whispered back “okay” and scurried back to her mom. I always get a kick out of little kids reactions. But then the lady standing behind me told me that I shouldn’t lie to children like that and instead teach them “acceptance and body positivity.”

I told her it’s great to teach children that, but I just like to get a laugh when I can.

I only do this sometimes when kids ask, it’s really funny to see their reactions.

I usually just let things go and try to keep the piece. We both have sons who are around the same age. My nephew is 13 and my son just turned 11. For my sons birthday I bought him the new gaming system he has been wanting. He was absolutely thrilled and he plays nonstop. 

My sister is bad with money. I usually have to lend her money for bills and stuff for my nephew. I know my nephew doesn’t always get the best Christmas gifts so this year I went a little crazy and I purchased the same gaming system for him for Christmas. I already had it ready and wrapped under my tree.

Yesterday my sisters family came to visit. My son asked me if they could go play video games. I said yes and reminded them to be careful. About 30 minutes later my son comes running to me crying. I asked him what was wrong and he led me to the front hall. When we get to the stairs I see the new system smashed on the floor. Someone had thrown it from the upstairs and it was now smashed to pieces.

I asked my son what happened and he sobbed and pointed at his cousin. I asked my nephew if he did this and he started to laugh. He said that it was a “stupid baby toy” and that he saw people break them online. 

My sister came in and I told her what happened. I explained that this was an expensive system and that her son needs to be disaplined for what he did. I told her I wanted her to pay for what her son broke.

She laughed and said no. She says I shouldn’t have let them play unsupervised. That it was my fault and that I am a bad parent. She said my son will get over it and that it was not important. 

Seeing my son sitting on the ground next to his broken system trying to put the pieces back together tore my heart out. I walked over to the Christmas tree and grabbed the system that was meant for my nephew. I pulled the gift wrap off and it gave it to son and told him to go upstairs and set it up.

My sister asked me why I was making such a big deal when I had another one already. I than laughed and told her that was her sons Christmas gift. That since it wasn’t important and it was just a stupid baby toy than they obviously won’t miss it. I than told them to leave.

My nephew realized what happened and began to cry that my son had stole his system. I said no his was the one that he smashed. My sister was livid and told me that I will never see them again. I just said okay and slammed the door.

Other family members have now been calling me nonstop and saying I am an asshole and that I ruined my nephews Christmas. I don’t think so though. My nephew is 13. He is not a stupid kid and he knew what he was doing. I don’t care that it was over jealousy, he is old enough to know better. My sister was not going to make the situation right so I just did what I had to do.

They all think I should buy another new system for him but I don’t have that kind of money. I’m starting to feel bad about this and I am wondering AITA?",2020-11-15 17:14:37,2653,30976,0.94,4,0,69,1,1,36,16,29,39,,33,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,1,,1,1,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When we were younger he'd go out of his way to make my life a living hell. To my parent's credit they did tell him off for it when they caught him but they both worked long hours and didn't have the energy to deal with our arguments. This continued into adulthood. He was salty that he failed his college course the first time around.

There was a bad argument in our family a while ago and, I shit you not, it all started because I refused the decorate my brothers living room. I wont go into too much detail but he wanted a pretty hefty discount, I said no and he threw a tantrum.

You really need to meet my brother to understand just how bad he is. But hopefully this post will do it some justice. Instead of being a grown up and talking to me, he decided to hook up with my toxic ex girlfriend and the mother of my child. Due to the rules here I can't go into a lot of detail about what she was like but she was not a nice person. She never really bonded with our son when he was born and I was left to do everything by myself. She eventually walked out on us and refused to have any contact with our son. She'll post on Facebook now and then about her beautiful baby boy to get sympathy votes but that's about it.

I have been a single dad for almost three years now and I absolutely adore my son but it hurts to think that one day he might question why his mum didn't want anything to do with him. How am I supposed to explain that to him?

Anyway, it bothered me when my brother told me they'd hooked up together. It hurt even more when he started dating her. It had taken me so long to get over what she did to me and my child and now my own brother was bringing her back into my life.

Yesterday we had a family video call (parents are high risk and we're not taking any chances) when my brother decided to announce that he and my ex were expecting.

I just froze, I didn't know what to do or think. I could feel myself starting to cry a little bit and it got a bit harder to breathe. Eventually I decided to just congratulate them and then made up some lie about needing to put my son down for a nap and left.

I received a bunch of messages from my brother and his gf telling me that I stole their thunder. After I left, my parents and some other family members started worrying if I was okay and not really focusing on their news. My uncle told me that I should've just ""been a man"" and stuck it out instead of making excuses to get out of it, after all it was expected that our kids would be raised around each other.

I feel like maybe I shouldn't have left the call but at the same time it would've been worse if I'd stayed and had a full blown panic attack in front of everyone. Some of the family members are split and have argued that I won't be able to avoid my brother and his family forever but others believe I was in the right to leave that situation. I don't know what to think

EDIT

I just wanted to say thank you first of all for all the support. I fell asleep last night and woke up to so many kind and supportive comments.  

A lot of people have been asking how my parents feel about this. They aren't happy but they don't have the energy to deal with all the hassle my brother would cause. They actually cut him off for a little wile when he started dating my ex but he phoned them constantly and, again can't go into much detail, but he said he'd do something not so good. They keep him at arms length but I have told them not to cut contact because of me. If they want to cut contact on their own accord then that's fine but I do not want to be the reason that they have to deal with his tantrums.

The rest of the family, for the most part, weren't happy about it but accepted it (or pretended to) when they started getting a bit more serious. My uncle )who told me to be a man) thought it was funny, that's just the kind of person he is.

I think as hard as it might be, I am going to cut off contact with my brother and ex. As a lot of people pointed out, not for my sake but for the sake of my son. I don't want to put him through all that.

We're struggling so much trying to do everything we can to help him deal and cope with his condition. It's been difficult enough without my mother in law getting involved and making decisions without talking to me and my husband first. She'd completely disregard our fears and concerns as parents and claim we don't know what's best for her grandson by trying to control doctors appointments/arguing with doctors. Criticizing and telling them how to do their job/ bringing medication that her friend doctor prescribed without even diagnosing my son.

She'd get mad if we don't comply and do what she tells us. Her latest stunt was showing up at my son's appointment and making a scene resulting in me and my husband going no contact and changing the clinic by having my son's medical file transformed to another clinic.

My mother in law was removed from any emergency contact we had before and we made it clear to the new doctor to not share our son's medical information. My mother in law kept trying to find out what clinic/which doctor our son goes to and she tried to guilty tip my husband and also get the family to pressure us into letting her know. No one realized the negative affect she had on my son's health and progress and the family kept calling me awful and resentful because she's just worried for her grandson.

Last week. I found out that my mother in law was at the clinic and was speaking to my son's pediatrician about my son's condition. My husband told me his mom called and told him she was talking to the doctor discussing our son's condition. He told me he didn't want to speak to his mom but she called to let him know that she has a right to take part in her grandson's care and that we shouldn't try to hide things from her since she eventually was able to find out.

I was livid. I was so angry I went to talk to the doctor about the conversation she had with my mother in law and the fact that she disclosed medical information after being told several times that this would cause us plenty of issues because of my mother in law's behavior. Mother in law is already trying to get involved and I just couldn't take it. I reported the doctor and filled an HIPAA complaint.

I was told to back off but I couldn't take this massive lack of professionalism on the doctor's part and the fact that now I'm having to deal with my mother in law's attempts to control the situation.

My mother in law spread the news about the doctor and the whole family was stunned saying my bitterness jeopardized the doctor's career and that she only shared information with my son's grandmother not some stranger. Also said that I'm not being focused on my son and choosing to start arguments instead. Basically made it look like it's my fault. I'm so tired and I can't take it anymore. My husband agrees that I shouldn't have filed a complaint like he has no problem with his mother now showing up at the clinic and causing scenes.


Information to add here: my son goes to a licensed medical doctor. Mother in law says she knows a doctor that happens to be friend of hers but I'm not sure if he even has a license or even work at the hospital or clinic we were never told who he was nor even met him before. But that was before the fight we had with her. She no longer mentions him and is focused on getting directly involved with my son's care.",2020-11-22 17:37:29,1834,19759,0.94,12,0,69,2,,11,4,8,5,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I (24m) have never been like the other men in my family. I'm introverted, artistic, and would rather cosplay than play sports. At age 14 my great-grandmother moved in with us and she taught me how to crochet. I loved it but my brothers, Jim (27m) and Tim (27m), used to tease me constantly for it when she wasn't around and whenever I would complain my dad told me that life's full of people that are going to call me names and that I need to ""toughen"" up. I honestly think he was just disappointed that I wasn't an extroverted jock like him and his other sons, felt like he could just pressure me into becoming more like him.

When my great-grandmother died she didn't have much but she specifically left me her crochet ""hooks"" and I was very touched. She also left my cousin an unfinished baby socks that she was crocheting for the my cousin's baby, and I could tell my cousin was disappointed. We kind of had this tradition of our great-grandmother making things for the coming babies. I offered to finish what our great-grandmother started, using her hooks, and my cousin was thrilled at the gesture.

After that I kinda inherited the position of crocheting things for any new babies in the family and I rather enjoyed it because I felt as if I was carrying on a legacy. Although, it did nothing to stop my mediate family from making jokes and calling me names. Despite the constant attacks against my sexuality Jim, ironically, came out as gay and has since apologized for his past treatment of me so we're on good terms but Tim is still a jerk to me.

When I went to college I went low-contact with Tim and my father and would just tolerate them at family events. Last week Tim announced that he and his girlfriend, Tina (24f) were engaged and expecting their first child over social media and everyone was thrilled. During a zoom meeting with the family Tina said she would love a matching blanket, little hat and shoes for the baby from me, and I asked her to send me a copy of her registry for baby clothes. Tim laughed and said everyone knows that it's tradition that I make the items. I told him flat out that he doesn't get to make fun of my skills as a crocheter and then expect free labor from me.

My dad said that I was being rude and needed to apologize. I countered that if Tim was hurt by my refusal to crochet for him then he should just ""toughen"" up and get over it and then left the call. Since then I've been getting text messages from my parents and Tim saying that I'm being petty and a jerk to Tina and the baby, but I haven't responded. AITA for refusing to crochet something for my brother's baby after years of teasing?

Edit: Okay since I keep seeing this I'm just going to give some info. Yes I am aware that you crochet with HOOKS and not ""needles."" When my great-grandmother was teaching me she referred to them as a ""needle."" Granted she obviously made a mistake but when I was first learning it just stuck so that what I always refer to them personally and I will correct it.

Edit For More Info: For more information the last time my dad and Tim made fun of /harassed me crocheting something was last year at Christmas. It's not like they stopped teasing me, calling me rude names, or questioning my manhood when I went to college.",2020-11-18 08:39:14,2137,25599,0.96,0,0,126,0,1,11,11,13,16,,23,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has been causing a conflict with my entire family. And they think that I'm being selfish and unreasonable. Let me explain first.

I M39 lost my son in 2019 due to a chronic heart condition. He was 15 years old. It was devastating and I just couldn't take it especially when my family did little to nothing to support me during these difficult times. They didn't bring my son meals when he was at the hospital. They didn't let me go home and rest even for a few hours. They didn't take care of other things while I had a lot to deal with I wasn't offered any help just words. They'd just talk but do nothing.

Despite the struggle. I've created an account for my son's college fund and kept putting whatever I could get at the time and me and my son would talk about that a lot. He was depressed but always believed that he was going to get better and continue his education and attend college.

I started saving money To keep him motivated and to make him feel like he could be like any other kid with hopes for a good future. He had a very close friend that's about the same age as him. They were friends for 5 years, and I can't express how his presence in my son's life helped him through the worst days, sometimes his friend would spend the night with us and try to get my son to do activities and lighten up his mood all the time. To be frank his friend was closer to him than his own family.

He never stopped visiting and asking how I'm doing after my son's death. He'd show me handmade projects he made for my son and as a way to remember him and we'd sometimes just sit and talk together or cry together. 

Last week. While I was with my family my sister asked me what I was going to do with my son's college money. I didn't wanna mention this but since she asked I told her that I will be giving the money to my son's friend. She barely even recognized his friend and was confused and said that my nephew deserves this money since he's family. My mom agreed that I wasn't thinking straight and that I should help the people close to me-family and that my nephew has a right to go to college and I was wrong for giving this ""opportunity"" away to someone else.

I didn't know what to say they kept pointing out that I was making a mistake and how my nephew will resent me if he finds out. Thing is my nephew wasn't close to my son I don't even know why he'd be bothered. My sister went on about not being able to afford my nephew's college I told her this was my decision and I felt more comfortable that way. She started lashing out, constantly texting me constantly wanting to talk to me and ending up arguing. When I snapped she had my mom calling me basically guilttripping me and telling me I'm wrong and that I needed to think about this.

It's just too much pressure and I'm feeling lost and unable to figure out how to deal with this.",2020-11-10 19:27:03,3339,30676,0.97,0,1,225,0,1,43,45,45,54,,97,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,1,3,1,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My cousin Amy (25F) has (6M) twins and has a nasty habit of dumping them onto relatives to babysit for the entire day without any warning or regard for their time. I (27F) have a very strained relationship with her but because my mom's side of the family demands that we all remain close-knit, so I have no choice to tolerate her.

When she initially gave birth to them, she teased me that I'll have to take on babysitting duty from now on. I'm no good with kids, so I remarked to her that if I ever have them, I'll train them, not babysit. She brushed me off.

The kids now are hella destructive and loud. Pulling out stuffing inside furniture, holes inside walls, smashing anything glass and porcelain, screaming louder than a fire alarm, you name it. When it was my first turn to deal with them, I immediately walked with them to the store and grabbed the biggest bag of M&M's I could find and trained them so that every time they follow my orders and behave, they get one. If they misbehave, I get one.

Soon enough, every time the kids were dumped on me, they went with my guidelines and behaved. Whenever I say sit, they sit at the table. When I say stay, they don't leave that spot, etc.

Two days ago there was a party planned with the whole extended family (I know, pandemic. Didn't want to, but mom insisted) and I grabbed the M&M's since the twins were there. Arrived, twins were being so destructive (an entire tray of food was spilled) that all the adults had enough and yelled at Amy to control them. She vomited the same excuse of them just being kids and they'll grow out of it eventually.

I shouted the twins' names and shook my M&M bag. They came running over to me and I popped 6  pieces into my mouth for their misbehavior. I told them to go clean up the mess or no candy all night. They do so.

Halfway through the party, every time something similar came up or they just weren't behaving, I was the one able to calm them down. When Amy saw what I was doing, she got angry and started yelling at me about how her children aren't animals and that I shouldn't be giving them so much candy anyway. I told her that I'm their aunt, not their parent, why am I the one disciplining them? Isn't that her job?

She screamed the same argument at me and since she's their mother, to stop giving them candy. One of the twins overheard and went apeshit. Dashed straight into the kitchen and started shattering anything they can get his hands on, shouting over and over that he wants candy. His twin joined him soon after. 

I repeated that she's their mother, and just sat in the living room watching it all unfold. At the end, Amy blamed me for them turning out this way. The other relatives she dumped them on (a majority) disagreed, but when I told a friend about the situation, he told me that the training I did can really fuck up the kids mentally later in life.

Not sure if that's the best word for what I actually feel but oh well. Betrayed, I guess.

So.. I got into some pretty childish social media drama last month. It was nothing that I personally started. I had commented on a friends post who had just had a break up and was just offering support. Well, some woman that I dont know and have never heard of messaged me in response to my comment saying ""Dont give out relationship advice when your own relationship is trash."" Or something to that affect. Like I said, I had no idea who this woman was. So, all I responded with was ""Who are you and what are you even talking about? My relationship is great and I wasnt forcing advice onto anyone."" She never responded.

So, I show my husband the message and he immediately gets weird. Apparently he knows this woman from years ago and she is a ""really nice person"" so ""someone must have hacked her account because she would never be mean or rude"". The thing is, he only hung out with her twice, nearly 12 years ago and spoke to her once online since that point so he truly does not know this woman at all.

So I simply asked him why he was trying to defend a woman who had reached out to ME being nasty instead of defending and taking my back. His response was ""I just dont think that it's her. I really dont."" He then messaged her himself and asked her if it was her and she said ""You know me just about well enough to know that I wouldnt say that. My son was using my phone. It was probably him."" Her son is 9 (I creeped), so I call bullshit. 

Anyways, he continued defending her. So I told him that it was extremely disrespectful to me that he is defending this woman and turning his back on me when I had done no wrong. He says I'm an AH for not dropping it and that she said it wasnt her so it wasnt. He also said ""Just because I married you doesnt mean that I cant defend another woman. I dont always have to agree with you."" Which was not the point I was trying to get at, obviously.

AITA?

To include: it reeks of affair, I know. But the woman lives 6 states over so that's impossible.

We've been homeless together, lost a baby together and slowly built our lives back up. He never liked the idea of marriage, saying, ""I don't see why the gov't has to be involved & why we should have to prove our love to anyone."" I get it, but marriage/a proposal are very important to me. He said he'd marry me because he plans on being with me indefinitely anyway & because he thinks it'd be good for our son. During my pregnancy he mentioned several times that he wanted to get married before our son was born. I waited but never got a proposal or anything. 

Last month was our 5 year anniversary & I thought it'd be great to get married that day. I was heartbroken he still never proposed, especially because he proposed to his last gf before me with a ring & everything. I let the idea of a romantic proposal go & reminded myself that marrying him was the most important part. He said if we could pull it off he was fine with it. He wanted nothing to do with setting it up, which was okay with me. Even for our baby shower he said he didn't want to hear about it, so a family friend & I took care of it ourselves. I changed my schedule at work, picked a location, time, 2 witnesses & someone ordained to officiate  (it was meant to be a small ceremony just to sign the license to make it legal). I ran some of the details by him throughout planning & he kept agreeing they were fine.

2 days before the wedding, the day I planned to go get the license, he said he felt ""forced & pushed into getting married"" & didn't like the idea of doing it now. So I had to cancel everything & explain to everyone at work when they asked how the wedding went. It was so pathetic & humiliating. I went into a major depressive episode & didn't even think we would be together much longer. He said he'd definitely marry me eventually but not now. I told him after what happened I would NEVER bring up marriage to him again. His response was, ""Okay, great! That's awesome!"" (not sarcastic at all, just completely relieved & happy). But I also told him that I wouldn't just be his gf forever. He didn't seem bothered by that, he was just happy I'd shut the fuck up about getting married to him.

He recently introduced me to someone as, ""This is my wife, Alicia"". It felt like a slap in the fucking face. He'd referred to me as his wife occasionally throughout the years before the wedding fiasco, but the fact that he still today calls me his wife really upsets me, because he fucked off that chance when he had it. Would I be the asshole if I told him I don't appreciate being called his wife after everything that happened & to not refer to me as such?

So, I work for an international company with many different nationalities, recently I have been assigned to a mainly American team (which means I have to work weird hours due to time zones but I’m a single guy with no kids so I can work around that). I live/work in Germany and prior to this team I only used English in writing and spoke German with everyone.

We had a couple of virtual meetings and I noticed some of the Americans mispronouncing my name - they called me Mr. Birch. So I corrected them, my surname is Bič (Czech noun meaning “a whip”, happens to be pronounced just like “bitch”). My name is not English and doesn’t have English meaning. Well, turns out the Americans felt extremely awkward about calling me Mr Bitch and using first names is not a norm here. HR got in touch with me and I just stated that I don’t see a problem with my name (and I don’t feel insulted by being called “Mr Bitch”), I mean, the German word for customer sounds like “cunt” in Czech, it’s just how it is.

Well apparently the American group I’m working with is demanding a different representative (they also work from home and feel uncomfortable saying “curse words”(my name) in front of their families), but due to the time zone issues the German office is having problems finding a replacement for me, nobody wants to work a 2am-7am office shift from home. So management approached me asking to just accept being called Mr Birch but honestly I am a bit offended. A coworker even suggested that I have grounds for discrimination complaint.

Am I the asshole for refusing to answer to a different name?

Edit due to common question: using first names is not our company policy due to different cultural customs, for many (me included) using first names with very distant coworkers is not comfortable and the management ruled that using surnames and titles is much more suitable for professional environment. I am aware that using first names is common in the USA, please mind that while the company is international, the US office is just one of the branches.

Edit 2: many people are telling me to suck it up and change my name or the pronunciation, because many American immigrants did that. So I just want to remind you: I am not an immigrant. I do not live in the US nor do I intend to. I deal with 10ish Americans in video calls and a few dozen in email communication. Then I also deal with hundreds of others at my job - French, Indian, Japanese, Russian... I live in Germany and am from Czech Republic. I know this is a shock for some but really, Americans are a minority in this story.

Edit 3: I deal with other teams as well, everyone calls me Mr Bič, having one single team call me by my first name (which is impolite) or by changing my name is troublesome because things like Birch really do sound different. Someone mentioned Beach, which still sounds odd but it’s better than Birch. Right now I have three options as last resort, if they absolutely cannot speak my name and if German office doesn’t re-assign me: 1. use beach, 2. use Mr Representative, 3. switch to German, which is our office’s official language. Nobody has issues with Bič when speaking German. (Yeah the last option is kind of silly, I know for a fact not everyone in the team speaks German and we would still use English in writing)

Edit4: last edit. Dear Americans, I know you use first names in business/work environment. Please please please understand that the rest of the world is not America. Simply using English for convenience sake does not mean we have to follow specific American customs.",2020-11-11 12:28:53,3278,22332,0.96,3,13,41,3,,6,9,,10,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to corona I had to move from campus to my parents house again.
Since I moved back I started to have a mayor argument with my parents.
My parents often come into my room due to various reasons ( I feel like they are looking for reasons to come into my room), since it started annoying me, I started to lock my door to ensure my privacy.
So one day I was changing in my room after a shower and my mother wanted to come into my room, I told her to wait because I was changing and she got mad because she wanted to come in now.
I told her I don’t want her to see me while changing and that she has to wait.
She got mad at me for this because she thinks it’s disrespectful towards our relationship.
When I told her I simply don’t want anybody to watch me changing, she called me a Hypokrit because I have pictures in my bikini on my Instagram.
When I said these are two different things, because in that one scenario I „want“ to be seen and I’m giving my consent to the viewer and in the other I’m trying to be alone and I don’t want to be seen. she simply said it’s her house and her rules and if I want to continue living with them my door has to be unlocked all the time.
I simply told her I rather move out again and try to pay for my own place than to continue living with someone that doesn’t value my privacy.
She thinks I’m dramatic and overreacting and damaging our relationship due to something so „minor“ but I really feel devalued in my privacy.",2020-11-25 15:36:51,1266,16323,0.95,0,0,104,0,,13,9,5,10,,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I decided to bring my situation here so I can get some third-party advice.

My ""son"" (now daughter) (15f) recently came out as a transgender girl. We immediately accepted her, told her we loved her no matter what. I got her talking to a gender specialist/therapist, we entered family therapy and my husband and I have spent a lot of time reading and educating ourselves on what it means to be trans. Unfortunately, my husband and I also lost a lot of friends and family who decided that my daughter was a freak and that we were abandoning our culture and values. While we realize that we are better off without these ignorant people, it has been tough, despite having my siblings, some close friends and my husband stand by me. So, several months ago, I joined a support group for parents of kids who are trans. It has been really helpful, and I feel like it is a great place for me to voice my concerns and also express my feelings.

A week ago, my daughter brought up how she probably wanted to change her name; right now, we are calling her a gender neutral nickname of her dead name (think Vikrant to Vicky). I completely understand that having remnants of your dead name can be very bad, so we told her that we would support her in her name-changing process. I also mentioned that I had a list of girl names that I never got use (I have three biological boys), and I would love if she wanted to use those names and if my husband and I, still got to name her. We even offered to do a redo of her traditional Hindu naming ceremony with her new name, which she loved. She said she would think about the names. She mentioned having a ""white"" name (like Samantha) and asked me what I thought. I told her that it was her choice, but I would love if she chose an Indian name, so she always has a piece of her heritage with her and that would make us happy. She said she hadn't thought of that and she'll come up with some names later.

I mentioned this in our support group, and one white mom got really angry at me. She started saying that I was a bad mom who was forcing my daughter to pick a name I wanted and forcing her to embrace a culture that rejected her. She brought up my estranged parents, who I had talked about in previous sessions, and how I was trying to force my daughter to be more like them. That was not my intention, but I feel terrible now and can't stop crying.

There’s been one thing I really wanted to do this year and that’s go to this amazing restaurant in our city for lunch one day. It’s a two Michelin star place, super fancy, and super duper hard to get lunch reservations specifically on weekends. 

Anyways I called about a week ago for reservations. They said weekends were usually full but since I told them it would be my birthday, they managed to find me a small two person table for the occasion, on my exact birthday. 

I told my husband that I was planning on going but this restaurant is not vegan friendly for their weekend lunches. It’s a multi-course seasonal prix fixe menu only, no a la carte, no vegan/vegetarian alternative. He got upset at this, because he’s vegan and we’ve always made it a priority to eat at only vegan-friendly places. I was blunt and said I just wanted to try this place in particular and was planning on going by myself, no pressure on him going at all.

Since then he’s been mad and sad and everything in between. He’s upset I’ll be spending part of my birthday day by myself even though I assured him it’s only a 2 hour max thing. Then he said it’s selfish of me to choose one of the only restaurants without any vegan options, as it seems I’m trying to exclude him intentionally on a special day. So now I feel really guilty and am questioning if it’s even worth all this drama. AITA for still wanting to go?

**Edit**: just woke up to overwhelming responses! Addressing a few more things here:

1) I’m going by myself, so I’m not making him sit and watch me eat! We have plans for a very casual vegan-friendly dinner that same night to celebrate, so the lunch isn’t the only meal for the day. 

2) I called honestly not expecting to get a table, I was just curious and wanted to know the wait. The restaurant is operating a half-capacity I believe because the tables are all spaced out and you can’t have more than a few people at each. They offered me a small corner table meant for 2, but it’ll just be me. It’s probably not a “prime” location but I don’t care! 

3) I’m not in the US, restaurants are still operating normally here (but with restrictions), and we don’t have a huge runaway covid issue here. If I were in the US and some other places right now, I would not be considering restaurant meals so I recognize we’ve been luckier than most.

4) I’d love to share with everyone the restaurant name and menu but I’m a little paranoid about drawing negative attention to them and getting this blasted across the internet. I’m not trying to get between any pro-vegan/anti-vegan internet war. Anyways I’ve DMed the website/menu to a few people already and will probably message a few more people that are interested!

5) My husband is pretty great normally so I think he’s probably just slightly taken aback I’ve chosen the restaurant I have. He’s not much of a foodie type and I usually go along with his terms when choosing restaurants so I don’t think he expected me to want fine dining as a bday present for myself! I will definitely talk to him more and try to express my feelings better so we reach an understanding. I will probably go ahead and eat there though regardless!",2020-11-24 14:37:01,1725,9516,0.96,1,6,148,1,,5,,2,3,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s dangerous to cross against the light because the speed limit is 45, but people do anyway. I saw a group of teens standing on the divider, waiting to cross my lane, but figured they were waiting for the light to change so they had the right of way before they crossed. Well, they didn’t, and one kid walked right in front of my car. I slammed on the brakes but couldn’t swerve because there were cars in the lane next to me. 

He was pretty seriously injured, but survived, and from the most recent info I have he has regained full mobility but continues to deal with some cognitive issues. I blamed myself for a long time and spent several months in therapy over the guilt. But overall the accident was not at all my fault; by the laws of physics I could not have stopped in time, I was obeying all traffic laws, and he knowingly walked directly into multiple lanes of oncoming traffic against the light. Apparently he said he assumed I would stop for him. But if I hadn't hit him, a car in the lane next to me absolutely would have.

My insurance company defended me in the multiple lawsuits from his parents health insurance company and the ones his parents filed against me personally, and I was ruled not at fault every time. But unsurprisingly his parents are now seriously struggling to pay off his medical bills, and think I should be paying most or all of it. According to the GoFundMe, they have well over six figures of bills, will be losing their house, and one of the parents is out of work now. I’ve been contacted by no less than 20 people insisting that since I “hit him with my car”, I have a moral obligation to help pay. 

My issue: my husband and I both lost close relatives to what’s going around, and received modest inheritances we were not expecting. So technically, we do now have the money to help (without it we wouldn’t be able to make any meaningful dent in the debt). Our plan had been to use that to pay for IVF to start a family, and potentially adoption if that's how it goes. But now, with so many friends/family members of the boy reaching out to my husband directly about the GoFundMe too, my husband says he feels “morally conflicted” using that money to, in his words “create a whole new kid when one is already in need”. He wants to give the money to the boy’s parents to help pay off their debt, and is now even talking about the “payment plan” they want me to agree to. 

I understand that technically I hit a kid with my car, but under the circumstances I don’t think I should have to sacrifice having my own kid because of his carelessness. My husband (and the legion of people harassing me) says it’s cruel to refuse to pay a dime. I think helping even a token amount will open the floodgates, and I don’t feel bad about refusing. Should I? My husband is someone I see as a really reasonably person, so he’s making me second guess my feelings.",2020-11-20 18:42:38,2009,12107,0.96,1,7,142,0,,2,4,2,2,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She didn't like having a younger sibling and had no interest in me. She moved out when she was 18 and ceased any contact with me, even going as far as rubbing it in my face how she never wanted to know me, by showing up for Christmas at grandparents houses and bringing gifts for our cousins but not me, and by showing up for their birthdays but not mine. The last time I was any way hopeful for us to have a relationship was at our youngest cousins 1st birthday party when I was 15. She brought along her friends and was mocking me for trying to talk to her when I saw her earlier at the party. So I hardened toward her that day and decided if she didn't want to be my sister then I would just need to accept that and move on from her.

She got married when I was 17 and told our parents I was not welcome. Our parents tried to change her mind but she was not having it. I thought that was when they realized there was no way we were going to be buddies some day or even real family.

And now they expect me to help her out. She got divorced from her husband four years ago, he got her into a lot of debt and then bailed. They have a 7 year old together. She lost her job recently and she got a new job in my city and then the rental she had planned to move into fell through and she ended up asking me to stay. I told her no. She went to our parents and the three put pressure on me. When I stood by my stance they paid for her to stay in a hotel for a while...

She has not been able to secure a place and apparently lost the job due to a lack of actual address.

They are all saying I turned my back on her and we should help family. I got really frustrated with all of them but especially my parents. She has NEVER wanted a single thing to do to me. She has purposely gone out of her way to hurt my feelings and make it clear I am nothing to her. But I'm supposed to help her out because she's a struggling single mom? After everything? With no apology or actual sign that she doesn't feel the same about me.

Where my guilt is coming in to ask this is she has a daughter and I feel bad for her. But her daughter is also a stranger to me. I have never been part of her life and I don't even know if she knows who I am. But still, she's a kid and as a mom now I am wondering if I am being a total dick here like they seem to believe.

AITA?

Fixed the typo about her being the younger sibling. It's that she didn't like having one. Also want to add because it keeps coming up that more could have happened before I was born in the early years that I am not aware of. But all I have ever been told is she reacted negatively to having a sibling and that's all I've ever known from her. I can't say I know of anything that could have caused it.",2020-11-20 10:32:40,1696,18830,0.95,0,1,193,0,,8,12,1,5,,21,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My fiancée and her friend were talking about him and apparently the friend tried to convince my fiancée to cheat. She refused and told me. 

I visited her at work recently and this friend began telling me that we should have an open relationship and I’m holding my fiancée back. I mostly laughed it off at first and told her I wasn’t comfortable with that kind of relationship. She kept pushing so I told her, “ Can you fuck off? I barely even know your name lady. Your opinion does not matter to me.” 

She got mad and called me an asshole. My fiancée was mad I treated her friend that way because, “she was joking.” 
Am I the asshole for getting mad?

I live in a fairly remote area that attracts a lot of tourists due to a nearby popular hiking trail. My place has 4 units. Two are Airbnb type rentals and two are permanent residences. Mine is one of the permanent ones. We have a lot of problems with tourists using our parking for turning around, looking up directions, or just trying to park and leave their cars while they go hike. There is a large parking area for tourists by the trailhead. Our parking area is a large, open area. This is private property and there are signs posted.

I have 3 friendly dogs and the other permanent resident has 2. We very rarely leash any of them. We just let the out and supervise their running and playing. I will leash them if on of the Airbnb guests has an issue with dogs.

So I go to let my dogs out this afternoon and there is someone out in our parking area, messing with his snow chains. He has a kid (around 9-10 years old) with him.

Me (M): Are you visiting someone here?

I get no response, so I ask again. Still no response. So I start playing frisbee with one of my dogs.

Tourist (T): Can you please leash your dogs? We are afraid.

M: Are you visiting someone here?

T: No, I’m just stopped to take the chains off.

M: Then, no, I’m not leashing my dogs.

T: We are afraid of dogs.

M: This is MY home. My dogs are on my private property.

Tourist gives me a dirty look but doesn’t say anything. He finishes taking his snow chains off and is getting ready to leave.

T (with a rude tone): I’m sorry I asked you to leash your dogs. We’re just allergic and afraid.

M: You are on private property and are  trespassing. My dogs have a right to be here, on their property. Maybe you should have thought about that before saying something.

He didn’t say anything else and left a few minutes later.

I posted about the incident on my Facebook and someone said I was rude for not accommodating. I think I’m in the right because it’s my property and this guy had no right to be here and was trespassing. So, users of Reddit, AITA?

Edit to add a few things.
Info: 1. The local laws are that dogs must be “under control” at all times, meaning leashed, tethered, fenced, or voice commands. My dogs are all trained to obey voice commands. 2. Public parking areas are available less than half a mile in either direction. 3. He was fully in my driveway with room to put at least 2 vehicles between him and the entrance.

Also, I could and would have been nicer if I hadn’t asked him twice if he was visiting and been ignored. It wasn’t clear what he was doing when I first went out because he was standing next to his car. I didn’t get really close because I am female and was concerned for my own safety.

Edit 2: Once he told me he was scared of dogs, I made sure they stayed away from him and his car.

Final edit (I hope): I got home from work and there was a note on my door. It basically said he would have been much more comfortable if I had leashed my dogs but thanked me for “at least being nice enough to keep the dogs away.”  So, for all the people who said I’m TA, at least know I wasn’t a total AH.",2020-11-26 22:40:39,1132,13143,0.94,1,3,155,2,,3,5,2,5,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have five kids with my now ex-wife, (7F), (5F), (2M and 2M), and a seven month old baby boy. When my ex was pregnant with the baby, she decided that she didn't want to be involved with me or the kids anymore, so she divorced me and signed all her rights away. The only reason that I know she's still alive is the child support checks that I get. 

My kids are obviously still upset over their mum just getting up and leaving without even giving them a heartfelt goodbye. My oldest has expressed being cross towards me regarding the situation, since she's the only one that truly understands that her mom probably won't come back. She feels abandoned and has come to me crying, because she believes that her mum doesn't love her anymore. My other daughter still believes that her mum's gonna come back, and it really hurts to hear her ask when she'll be back. 

My other kids, obviously, don't understand where their mum has gone. All I can truly get from them is tears, and asking where their mum has went. 

Just to be clear, I don't badmouth their mother, or say bad things in general about her to them. 

Yesterday, my ex called. I only picked up because I didn't recognize the number. She said hello, and asked if she could speak to the kids. I said no, mostly because I didn't know how they would react. She said that she missed them terribly, and because of COVID, couldn't see them, and she really wanted to hear their voices. 

I said that I wasn't comfortable with that. I told her that I would talk to my oldest two later on, and ask if they wanted to speak to her, but for now, I wouldn't allow it. She said that she was still their mum, and that she had the right to speak to them. I said that she lost any right to them when she signed those rights away. 

At this point, my wife raised her voice, and said that I was keeping her away from the people she loved most. I said that I didn't give care about her feelings, that she abandoned the kids, and to F-off like she did months ago before hanging up. 
My kids weren't in ear shot, just to be clear. 

I'm not proud of losing my temper, because I'm not that kind of guy. But I was at my wit's end, and couldn't take it anymore. 

I still have my mother-in-law as one of my contacts because I don't have anybody else to care for the kids if something happens to me. All night, she's been blowing up my phone, saying that my ex-wife is still a mother, and has a right to talk to her kids.

This is my first time posting so excuse me for any mistakes I make. I’m a 57 year old male, and my wife is 51 year old female, we’ve been married for 28 years and have one son together that is 25. She’s a stay at home wife, she never worked a day after we got married since I inherited a company that had been in my family for many generations so money was never a problem and we lived more than comfortably. 

When our son was little she took care of him and the house. Now that he’s an adult the chores are the only thing that she does, she used to take on writing but gave up because she said that it’s not as easy as she thought. Now I don’t consider myself sexist or that woman belongs in the house with kids, this was her choice because she never liked to work. The problem is I work long hours and expect to at least have a dinner after the long day.

We have a housekeeper that comes over twice a week so her responsibilities are basically cooking and smaller chores. She stopped cooking and doing things lately because she doesn’t feel like doing it. She spends her days hanging with her friends and shopping. Also our son was born as a female and my wife always wanted a daughter, when he came out as trans she threw a fit and was unsupportive, I paid for his  surgery and he transitioned, she was never as caring towards him as before and uses wring pronounces and his old name all the time.

The other day I came home and she didn’t do anything whole day and I snapped, I told her that I’m sick of her not doing anything while I’m providing for our family ( My son is also still in college, and I pay for all of his expenses and apartment because I want him to focus on school). The argument went on and she decided to throw in my face how it’s my fault she lost her daughter. This really socked me and I told her that she is lazy and also a terrible mother for talking as if her child is dead when we have a perfect and healthy son.

I am at lost, half of family members are siding with her half with me ( including our son), she called me an asshole and went to stay with her sister. Was I the asshole? I’m seriously considering divorce.

Edit: thank you for everyone commenting I just wanted to clear up that my son has been out since he was 14 and had his surgery 5 years ago.

Another edit: few of you questioned my son siding with his mom, I don’t know how you got that but my son is definitely on my side (even tho he doesn’t know the full story).",2020-11-17 17:22:53,1923,20056,0.93,2,2,168,11,1,20,16,13,19,,21,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I 36F went through an incredibly hard time losing my baby while I was 5 months pregnant with him. This has affected me both physically and emotionally. I don't have kids and my husband and I have been struggling for a long time trying to have kids. My sister has been supportive of me, she's 7 years younger than me and has been married to her husband for two years now. She visited me several times to see how I was doing. Her husband however seems to have an issue with me personally. He's always been treating me poorly and acting like he's somehow superior to me and my husband, my husband doesn't see my family much so this wasn't an issue especially when my brother in law comes over.

My husband and I were invited to thanksgiving dinner at my mom's house. We got there a bit late because I was taking care of some tests at the hospital that needed to be done so that my doctor could see them the next day. We sat at the table my aunt was present she lives alone so she always visits and casually talked about several things. I noticed my sister and my brother in law were whispering something to each other and at some point I heard my sister tell her husband to knock it off. We were confused we had no idea what was going next thing I knew my brother in law got up from his seat and announced that they were expecting.

I looked at my husband and he was shocked but not because of the news but the way it was given. My sister hid her face in her hands and did nothing else except that. It took me time to process this while my aunt got up and started hugging and congratulating my sister. I don't know what suddenly happened to me my heart started pounding and my husband was already gone to the bathroom to wash up. I just gathered my things and took my purse then told them to finish their dinner then I walked out. My sister was sitting there the entire time and just watched me and my husband walk out while my mom was trying to convince me to stay for a little longer.

I felt absolutely horrible. I only lost my baby two weeks ago and for me to be taken off guard like that is just horrible. I got no calls nor texts from my sister wanting to talk, nothing but my aunt called me to tell me what I did was totally inappropriate and that I should've stayed and congratulated my sister and her husband. Even berated my husband for not reacting differently. I argued with her that my brother in law did it purposely and that he could've picked a better time but instead chose to spite me and my husband while still grieving our baby.

During the whole application and interview process I communicated with the same person, the office manager ""Susan"". We had a couple of messages on email and she conducted my Zoom interview. I got my job offer a couple of weeks ago, and have been WFH for the company ever since.

At the end of last week, I had an email arrive from someone representing the company's LGBTQ group (this was the national group representing my company, I work for them in a regional capacity), saying that I had a standing invitation to join them in their next Zoom chat, if only to meet other LGBTQ people at the company and have a conversation with them. I am a cis heterosexual woman. I replied saying that while I'd love to join them as an ally, there had been some kind of miscommunication, as I'm not LGBTQ. I got a quick response to that apologising, saying that my name had been passed onto them as a new transgender employee. The only time I've discussed sexuality has been on the anonymous equal opportunities form that I submitted alongside my initial application, which stated that I was straight and cis.

A couple of hours after that, I got called to an emergency meeting with Susan. When I entered the call she practically screamed at me that I'd misled her. I asked how, and she said that she and the entire hiring team had assumed that I was transgender because of the fact that I put my pronouns into my email signature. If anything, I do this because it will make whoever I'm communicating with feel sure in the pronouns that I use, and saves them from having to ask (which is something that I believe should be commonplace, but that's just me). I reiterated this to Susan, and said that I'd never tried to mislead anyone. She said that she'd only seen trans people feel the need to mention their pronouns before, and that when my face appeared on the Zoom interview it ""could've realistically been a trans woman"", so she continued on with her assumption. She also hinted at the fact that my supposed gender identity had resulted in a big swing in my favour over other candidates, and some of the hiring team now feel like I should be ""let go"" as I wasn't the best applicant on skill alone. I've double checked since, and while the company can fire me without cause for the next year or so, since a protected category (sex) has been identified as a potential factor, I'd have recourse to challenge them on that if they were to terminate my contract in the very next future (because while you can't fire someone based on their gender identity, you also can't hire someone solely based on your perception of it either). She ended the call by saying that this wouldn't be going any further right now, but on behalf of the trans employees at the company, she was very offended at my ""choices"".

I'm not going to ask about if I should stay in the job (not the right sub and also I barely have to talk to Susan now, so hopefully the drama will just die down), but was I wrong for immediately presenting myself in a way that could lead someone to assume that I was transgender?

Edit: Thank you to everyone for responding. I have realised that this is a greater issue than just this instance, and will be following the advice to create a paper trail to document this further before taking my next steps. On another note, if you're going to take the time to message me calling me fake and both a SJW *and* a TERF (I mean why??) then please know I'm not going to waste any energy on you. Also, if a username has ""throw"" in it, I'm not going to take the time and word count up explaining the exact reasons I'm using a throwaway.

I live in a not so well off area. I am not well of by any means, but I have a wifi connection. My wifi has a 4 device limit, its the cheapest plan they have. My neighbours have a 12 year old daughter who has to attend online classes, I know her well because she comes over fairly often to hang out with my daughter as they are friends. Her name is Shanaya. Shanaya's parents told her they cannot afford wifi, so she asked me if she can use mine. I agreed, and said the only condition was that she has to study hella hard and do her best. She agreed and has been using it for a while. Over the past 2 months, I have been finding it hard to use my wifi. The web portal for the wifi says 4 devices are constantly connected to it when all I am using is my phone and my daughter is using her laptop. Sometimes, my daughter can't connect to her own classes and uses data.

I asked Shanaya about it last week, and she said her parents forced her to tell them the password and that they have been using it. I went and spoke to her parents about it, and said that it is only for her to be able to attend classes. They said they will stop using it. But over the week, 4 times my daughters classes got interrupted because there were multiple devices trying to use it. Yesterday, Shanaya told me that our other neighbors also have the password and are also using it, that her parents gave it to them. I went and warned her parents again, said I will change the password, but they made false promises again and shut their door. I changed the password and gave shanaya the new one, but her parents forced it out of her again.

My daughters education needs to take priority, her classes are important. I can't let her education take a backseat, but if I change it again and not give shanaya the password, her education will get affected. WIBTA if I change the password and not tell Shanaya?

I said sure, no problem. I love my niece and nephew and I love spending time with them. It was also a nice way to get to know her husbands two kids better when they had them. It has worked great for three years I have been doing it. Then I started doing an occasional Saturday night for their date nights.

For a while I have had some issues with her husband. There were nights he didn't have his kids from a previous relationship but he wanted me to babysit as well and I never felt comfortable with this. When it is his parenting time absolutely no problem. But I know his ex from a past job and I do not want to get involved with her level of crazy which babysitting on her parenting time could potentially bring to my door. My sister and I talked about this before and she got him to back off for the most part. Because of this I was happy to continue.

So last Saturday I was supposed to babysit for them to have a kid free night after months of craziness due to Covid. My sisters husband shows up with all the kids (because it was their parenting time) AND his ex's younger child and her boyfriends kids. Nobody said anything to me. I never agreed to have all those kids and at the door he acted like an ass because I told him I was not babysitting all those kids.

I called my sister and she said she had no idea he would do that. I told her that I am tired of him pushing and that last night crossed a line for me and I am not willing to subject myself to the pressure again. Not to mention it made me feel like an ass having to deal with it while all the kids were standing there. Some of whom I had never laid eyes on before.

My sister is understandably hurt but said she understands. Her husband is telling me I'm an asshole for dropping out of things on such short notice.

My husband and I are best friends during the day. Love of my life. It's at night that's an issue. I'm a blanket stealer. I once yanked them so hard poor Hubby flipped a full 180. Hubby, for his part, is a thrasher. Bruce Lee would be jealous of the moves he pulls off while unconscious. It's a constant war between us when we fall asleep, and both of us often wake up sore and exhausted. It was starting to affect our relationship. Neither of us wanted to move to a separate bed because we like spending our nights together, but it seemed like an inevitability. We were both crabby every morning, and we started fighting as soon as we got up. It sucked, but neither of us wanted to concede defeat and move to the other bed.

Quick background: I was a huge nerd as a teenager. Full on otaku (go ahead, cringe, I do too). One night as a joke, I brought down an old anime body pillow from the attic (I know, the cringe) and plopped it down between my husband and I, declaring it our demilitarized zone. Hubby also thought it was hilarious, and we named her DMZ-chan. She stayed there the whole night.

It was a game changer. DMZ-chan protected me from Hubby's REM-induced rampages, and she's just heavy enough that I can't yank the blankets at full speed. DMZ-chan is now a beloved part of our nightly routine. We both thought it was the funniest thing, but she legitimately helped us solve the only real issue in our marriage.

One day, MIL stopped by to pick something up. She got up to use the restroom, passing by our open bedroom door. You can guess what she saw. DMZ-chan, propped up in the middle of our bed, her giant soulful anime eyes looking right back at MIL. When she got back, she quickly grabbed her stuff and left, Hubby and I both confused. She later mentioned DMZ-chan to Hubby while they were on the phone, and it absolutely mortified him. As far as I know, MIL now thinks we're deviants in a three-way relationship with a body pillow. Hubby was too embarrassed to explain, and now he wants to put DMZ-chan back in the attic.

I was upset. I told him I didn't want to go back to boxing each other at night, and that DMZ-chan helped us so much in that. He agreed, but suggested we get a normal, plain body pillow case to replace her. I felt like there was no need to spend money on something we already have, and if it really was that big of an issue, we can put her in the closet while we have company over. Hubby is firm in that she has to go permanently. I know he's embarrassed, but I feel we shouldn't have to compromise our inside jokes to appease other people. AITA?

**Edit:** Sweet bees this blew up. Was not expecting all the attention. Just wanted to say thank you to everyone for chiming in. I admit I was being stubborn; I drove over to Target on my lunch break and bought a new cover for 10 bucks. I put it on DMZ-chan as soon as I got home (to those asking, I did wash her after fishing her out of the attic), and am now waiting on Hubby to get home so I can apologize for making him uncomfortable. DMZ-chan shall live on in our hearts.

My husband and I have a queen bed. We have a twin bed in one bedroom, a full bed in our main guest room. We put my parents for the full. The full bed is not some rickety old thing- it’s maybe five years old?

I was all “o.O?!!” I said no. For me, it’s not just our bed - my parents would absolutely be the type to snoop around our bedroom.

My parents have been complaining off and on all day. They had an extra cup of coffee because they’re so tired. They need Advil because their back is so sore. Stuff like that.

This finally came to a head this last friday when my husband got upset with me for complaining that I was tired.

He told me I didnt need a break, that it's easy to do my job. I ended up screaming that the next day, he is tending to the house and kids and that I was locking myself in our room and playing video games all day.

True to my word, I refused to unlock the door saturday or do anything. My MIL called me pissed that I could do that to my family and that I was the AH for ignoring my family to play games. I told her that maybe if she raised her son better, it wouldnt have came to this. My husband is angry, my mil is angry and I feel like the AH.

Edit:

My husband is a web developer. When he gets home, he sits down and relaxes for the rest of the evening. He doesnt entertain the kids, he doesnt help with the house, he relaxes because hes worked so hard and is exhausted.

I love this guy to death but when I say he is lazy, that is seriously a huge fucking understatement and doesnt even shed an ounce of light on the actual problem. Hes also a gaming junkie-like the worst of their kind. For example, when a game is being released, he waits up until midnight to purchase the game (no matter how expensive) and will binge on it for weeks straight while hardly sleeping. During this time you will be lucky to get so much as a ""hello"" out of him without him getting pissed for you disrupting him. BUT still expects people to literally cater to his every need so that he doesnt have to get up to do anything. I dont entertain this because I'm not his fucking mother.

Anyways, a year and a half ago I had to give him an ultimatum. You either get a fucking job and start supporting yourself OR you can leave and go mooch off someone else. He chose to get a job. Lasted a month before he quit. Found another job 2 months later, lasted 2 weeks and quit. He was unemployed for 11 months when he finally landed this job in September. Assassins Creed was just released, what, 2 weeks ago and he started calling out every. single. day. Started staying up until 4am playing his game, would sleep until 8-10am and then be right back at it while asking me to cook and cater to him.

Yesterday I unplugged and hid his xbox. I knew he was going to call out and jump on his game. As I suspected, that's exactly what he tried doing. He picked a fight with me. Said he hated working and I was forcing him to waste away his life. Claimed he was depressed, though that's the first I've heard of it. He then tells me to get off my lazy ass and do something for once. I told him to leave. He takes my car because his is ""on its last leg""- his words. Hes not in work clothes so I know he wasnt going to work. I texted him and said ""If you arent going to work, bring my car back. And if you plan on flaking on this job like the rest of them, you will not be using my car or my internet. Make your choice.""

It was actually a derelict farmhouse with some land but it has a small turret so our family has always referred to it as The Castle. My wife and I decided we'd rather have a small, basic house in our home country and focus our time and resources readying The Castle for us to retire in and for our children to enjoy.

It took years but around the time our eldest was born it was finally finished. It's not massive; 5 bedrooms and a small pool in the gardens but it is our paradise. We've always allowed our families and friends to use it whenever they please, and have spent every summer vacation staying there with our children.

Our only stipulation when people stay there is that the master bedroom is off limits. It takes up most of the 3rd floor with the remaining bedrooms on the 2nd floor. A lot of my and my wife's belongings are in there, and it's also the room we have shared together for over twenty years. 

Recently my niece got engaged and held an engagement party on Zoom at the weekend. When asked what ideas they'd had so far she excitedly told me they'd actually been planning to ask us if they could hold the wedding at The Castle.

I was a bit taken aback but didn't want to outright refuse. I joked it would have to be a rather small wedding since they'd struggle to fit more than 25 people in the gardens. She gushed that she'd already thought it through and they'd put up canopies in the field nearby (we don't own that land) and if all the guests stayed in hotels in the town she would arrange transport for ""us all to get to the villa"".

My wife and I bit our tongues not wanting to make a fuss during their engament celebration. But later when my niece texted me to repeat what she'd said I asked her to clarify the sleeping arrangements and after some back and forth it came to light she plans to use the master bedroom as the bridal suite and for the wedding party to have the remaining rooms. My wife, children and I would have to stay elsewhere. 

I slept on my decision and spoke with my wife. On Sunday I responded and politely refused, saying it's too small and we aren't comfortable having anyone in our room. Both she and my sister blew up at me telling me I was ruining her wedding and she'd always dreamed of marrying at The Castle. My sister even said since I used my inheritance it's ""family property"" which is obviously ridiculous.

He’s been with this girl for six months and throughout the time we have gotten close because we both like hair, makeup, and shopping. I never knew there was anything wrong with their relationship except when she texted me last week I saying she would love to hang out but thinks it’ll be inappropriate because her and my brother broke up. I asked her why and she said she was sick and tired of “auditioning” to prove she was with him for the right reasons. She went on to say that my brother is paranoid she’s after his money so he would test her like 1. Leaving out his bank statements on their bed and getting upset when she picked it up 2. Going out to eat at high end restaurants he requested and leaving his wallet on home at purpose to make her pay the bill and prove she’s not going out with him for money 3. Never buying her gifts and questioning her when she asks why he doesn’t. 



I was shocked so I had to hear my brothers perspective. We spoke and he told me everything she said was true and that there’s nothing wrong with making sure his girlfriend is with him for the right reasons. He said he left his bank statements on the bed and was peeking through the door to see if she would be curious and when he saw her pick up the papers he knew in his gut she was using him for his money, so he set up the restaurant idea to see if she would get upset at paying a 500$ bill which she was. I asked him if he thinks her being an elementary school teacher could’ve contributed to her being upset at a 500$ bill at a restaurant he wanted to go to and he said no. He said the straw that broke was when she asked him why he hasn’t bought her a single gift since they’ve started dating when she bought him a gaming console and new rims for his car and he knew she was just discretely asking him to buy her an expensive gift. 


He confronted her and said he thinks she’s with him for his money so she said let me do us both a favor and dumped him and blocked him. He’s upset about the “gold digging bitch” and when I laughed he called me an asshole. He said I would never understand what’s it’s like being a rich man and being used and I get that concern, but I told him if he thinks any woman will be okay with his tests and auditions he’s delusional as hell.

My parents have always been kind of overprotective. Ever since I was old enough to make my first social media accounts, they insisted that they had to have the passwords to them. Being around 11 years old at the time, I agreed. I soon got upset though, since I started noticing messages being sent that weren't typed by me on my account. If my friends swore, my parents would send them a message acting as if they were me, being rude to them and telling them that I didn't want to be friends with them anymore. This caused a lot of fights between me and my friends. Meanwhile, my parents stated that it was for the best.

As I got older, this behaviour just got worse. Around high school, my dad installed security cameras in the house. He said it was for keeping us safe, but honestly, it feels like I'm in prison. The cameras are all in different angles to make sure there are no blind spots. They're placed in the kitchen, living room and all the hallways. None in the bedrooms or bathrooms though. He can check them on his phone along with use them as an intercom system to get upset at me if I'm doing something he doesn't like.

He made me install an App onto my phone that logs where I go, for how long and how I got there. It keeps this information for about a week and notifies him if I turn off my location sharing. He checks it often and then asks me about it almost daily. (ex. ""I saw you went to x's house today. How was that?""

He also keeps a paper in the house with all my usernames and passwords for every social media account I have that they know about. They make me update it yearly and test it before letting me go to make sure that it all works. They say that it's for safety reasons, so that if I go missing or something, they can check who I was talking to.

However, I'm 21 now. I live with them to save money since I'm still a full time university student. Recently, my dad asked me to update the passwords and I told him no, because I would like to have some privacy now. He got extremely upset and used his parental controls on the Wifi to cut my devices from getting connected for a week. I wasn't able to do my homework properly and I couldn't call with friends or anything because I don't have much data in my phone plan.

I got upset with my dad and got into a pretty bad argument with him. He said that he was just protecting me and that as my father it was his job to make sure that he always knew where I was and what I was doing. I tried talking to my mom about this, but she said that I shouldn't keep seeing the both of them as the bad guys and that I would eventually understand. She cried during our conversation and kept telling me how much I hurt my dad by implying that I don't trust him.

I've always been introverted and never go anywhere without telling them. I don't think I need to be surveilled this heavily but I do feel bad for upsetting my mom so much.

AITA?

EDIT: Woah, uh. This blew up overnight. Thank you to everyone who messaged me and gave me advice in here. To be honest, I was a little nervous posting on here because... Idk maybe I thought people would think I was completely in the wrong. I know it's the point here to find out but... Whew. Anyway, some things to clear up: I'm 21F. I forgot to mention that. I don't really mind people using he/him for me in here since they didn't know but I just thought I'd say.

I work part time and I don't pay for rent/utilities/wifi. My parents do ask me for large sums of money every once in a while to pay for stuff around the house (fixing the broken fridge, getting the heater replaced when it died, etc.) I live in Canada so uh, the stuff in Australia and USA doesn't help me but I appreciate it anyway.

I'll try to update you guys in the future. Thank you to everyone for your advice and wishing me good luck.",2020-11-22 21:59:36,1184,11920,0.96,0,0,190,0,,2,2,3,6,,16,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I share a bathroom with my brothers, and the other day I accidentally left a box of tampons on the counter instead of putting them away. My younger brother asked me what they were, and I said that they were tampons.

Cue him being very confused, and my older brother and I realising that he knows nothing about any of this stuff. We decided to give him a basic rundown of the female reproductive system and he seemed okay with it.

That night, he mentioned to our parents that we told him about periods and they got pretty upset. My mom said that he's way to young to be knowing about this and that it was inappropriate for us to be telling him. As it turns out, they're planning on opting him out of Sex Ed. at his school in the spring because he's, in their opinion, too young.

I can kind of see where they're coming from, he is their kid after all and I definitely could have just said that the tampons were ""feminine products"". However, this is something he would have to learn at some point and that wasn't going to happen if they didn't let him go to sex ed.

I'm not really sure, did we seriously overstep a boundary here? AITA?

Edit: For those people saying that this is obviously fake because I haven't replied to comments or something, no, I went to bed. I was sleeping. Calm down. 

To answer some questions: My older brother and I did mandatory Sex Ed in 5th grade, but my younger brother's was cancelled due to the state of the world. We also both did Sex Ed in 8th grade. I have no idea why they would opt out only him, but it's probably a youngest child thing.",2020-11-17 07:26:20,1687,13045,0.96,1,1,201,0,,9,4,8,3,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k05ly2/aita_for_removing_my_stalker_app_after_turning_25/,AITA for removing my stalker app after turning 25?,"I (25f) deal with parents, mainly my dad, who are pretty protective over me. At 18, my dad requested that we all download an app that logs your exact location, driving patterns and duration of stays. My mom lives at home, and my older brother is on the spectrum and needs a certain degree of supervision, so they agreed. I gave some pushback as I was an adult and it felt like an invasion of privacy. My dad argued that as I was financially dependent on my parents, I had to do as he said. He also said that he wasn't worried about what *I* would do, but worried about what *other people* would do to me, and if I ever ran into trouble my parents could rescue me. I initially agreed, but referred to it from then on as ""the stalker app"".

Most of the time it wasn't an issue, but sometimes there would be problems. If I let my parents know I would be out at night in one part of town, but ended up in another part of town, I'd get a text to contact dad immediately. If they saw that I was in my dorm after a certain time, I'd get a call to see if I overslept and missed class. This was definitely a bummer when it came planning to meet friends, going out to bars, having hookups...I felt like I had no privacy.

Fast forward to today, I just turned 25 this month and I still have the app on my phone. Except now I work a full-time job, live in Japan, and am completely independent from my parents, new phone and plan included.

I talked with my dad about this again, and now that he can't use money as something to hang over my head, he says it's necessary now more than ever to know where I am because I live in Japan and if something like a huge earthquake were to happen, he and mom need to know if I'm safely evacuated. He argued that if I have nothing to hide, why do I care so much that he knows where I am? While my mom agrees that my dad's fears are unreasonable, she says that only kids would care so much about having their parents not know their whereabouts and that I'm being immature for fighting this so much for so long, and to just let it be.

I decided this week to remove the stalker app and told him. He's not only mad that I'm standing my ground, but he thinks I'm selfish and to compensate, I have to text him everyday from now on. Mom jumps in and says that it's much less work for me to keep the app on my phone, so just let it go. I said that I should never have had this damn app in the first place, and that they're lucky that I had gone along with this for as long as I have. Both parents are mad at me and think I'm being immature, and I just want to know AITA for removing it after this long and am I making a big deal out of nothing?

TLDR; I (25f) have had a location app on my phone since I was 18, and my dad doesn't want me to remove it. I moved overseas and no longer financially rely on parents, so I told my dad I'm removing the app, he's upset, and parents think I'm being selfish for making them worry about me.

41,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jyle9d/aita_for_how_i_handled_a_students_inappropriate/,AITA for how I handled a student's inappropriate comment in my class?,"I teach undergrads. Recently they've been giving in-class presentations as the conclusion to a semester-long research project. Yesterday as one girl got up and was about to begin speaking, a boy loudly blurted out ""Holy shit! Those tits are huge!"" 

Yeah. *record scratch* ..... 

Once I recovered from a moment of 'did that really just happen' I immediately said to him, ""Why would you ever say something like that? That's completely unacceptable, you need to apologize and leave for the rest of the period."" Which he then did and there was no further issue from him.

I feel like I handled this as well as I could have? I've never had an overtly disruptive student before, I've had ones who don't do the work but the worst they do during class is just texting under the table. I was totally taken aback and so was the rest of the class. I heard a few whispers of ""what the fuck?"" and giggling, the poor girl looked mortified, and there's no way that's something you can just sweep under the rug as the teacher.

Last night I was telling my boyfriend about it. He didn't think I dealt with it well. He started questioning why I had the male student leave the room. His criticisms were that I was treating him like a child and publicly embarrassing him. When I countered that the female student was the one publicly embarrassed and I wasn't going to make her go on to present with someone who'd just harassed her in the audience, he said, ""Oh Jesus not everything is harassment, yeah it was horrible timing but guys his age are still awkward and making mistakes.""

I did not agree with this at all. He was completely missing the point. I started feeling like he thought what the male student did was okay. He said he didn't think it was but that ""young men need to be able to make mistakes without a woman crucifying them for it.""

The whole argument was ridiculous to me, it's not like I gave him an F or personally expelled him from the school. We're explicitly trained to have disruptive students leave the room if they cross a line. And this is college not high school, there are higher expectations for behavior. I'd clearly explained to my boyfriend that the comment was apropos of nothing, it was not a private joke between friends, the girl's chest was not exposed at all and there is no situation in a CLASSROOM where making a sexual remark about someone else is acceptable, ever. Let alone when it humiliates them right before they're about to be everyone's center of attention.

I ended up just dropping it because he wasn't listening. Now thinking more about it, it's been bothering me. Was I an asshole to the student?

Edit - I've replied to some comments but for some reason my comments aren't showing up when I log out? Don't know why but I'm assuming other people can't see them either, but they are visible on my profile.",2020-11-21 23:53:58,1465,7728,0.96,2,0,224,0,,4,8,7,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From 15 to 35 I had no contact with my family.  Over the years they have somehow managed to work their way back into my life.  Only in a small capacity.

My sister who is younger than me called earlier and asked what me and my husband were doing for Thanksgiving.  I told her that it was just us and that we were just going to have a nice dinner and probably watch TV for the night. And go to bed early. She told me that she was having dinner and that we need to show up.  I told her thank you but this was the first set of holidays in ten years that I didn't have to host and I was planning on staying home and just putting on a fresh pair of pajamas after a shower and not going anywhere. She then asked about Christmas and I told her the same thing.  She then asked when it would be a good time to get together.  I told her point blank that I wasn't all that interested given our history and that I was perfectly happy with how things were at this point.

This was when she got pissed off and started to yell at me saying that I need to start acting more a part of the family and that I need to let go of the past.  She told me that we as ""Family"" need to try and bridge the gap and move forward in a positive way.

I told her no we don't.  We hardly know each other.  We are very much strangers.  I also told her she needs to stop throwing the word family around like it is supposed to mean something to me.  When we started to talk again when I was 35 when our dad died her and my brother constantly berated me and told me that I need to just let them deal with everything that needed to be done.  I never disagreed with them. I told them them that they could handle it.  I was berated when our mother was sick for not visiting her in the hospital or when she was home.  I really don't have much of a relationship with my mom and she is a pretty good stranger as well so it didn't really matter. I threw everything back in her face.

Before we hung up she reminded me that it wasn't my husbands blood that runs through my body.  And blood is thicker than water.  I told her no.  My husbands blood did not in fact run through my body. But his semen did and that was close enough. I thought my husband was going to wet his pants.

So AITA for telling my sister to stop using the word family like it means something?

Edit. 

Good Morning everyone.  I hope that you are all having a great day.  First I wanted to say Thank you for all the responses, awards and everything else in between.  This has been completely insane.  I never thought this would go so far. I have tried to read every single response but there are so many that it will take hours to get through them all.  

I wanted to do this edit to fill in some blanks so to speak. When I was kicked out I was 15 and my sister was 8.  So she did not have anything to do with what happen.  But she had every opportunity to find me after a certain point.  When she was 16 and had her own car she could have come find me.  When she was 18 and on her own she could have come to find me.  She never did.  When our dad died it was a friend of mine who talked me into going so that I could maybe find some kind of peace with what happen all those years ago.  She and another friend went with.  My husband (boyfriend at the the time) had to work and couldn't get the time off.  Initially I was greeted with surprise and thank you for coming.  But then with hostility from my sister and brother.  If they for a minute thought I was out to get something from them or our dads estate they were wrong.  I wanted nothing. And to this day I still don't. 

 My siblings have always told me what my place in the family is.  Which is basically I'm window dressing. I have been told that I have no business in knowing anything about the family finances, family affairs or anything. I think that they are afraid that I could potentially take something that they want or are supposed to get.   A couple of weeks ago my mom asked me to read over some financial paperwork that she didn't understand. Reluctantly I agreed but once my sister found out she screamed at me for putting my nose into areas that I don't belong. I told my mom not to ask me for anything again because I will not be involved.  

I have been asked a few times why I do keep in contact with them.  The answer is because it's my way of keeping ahead of them.  I do not voluntarily make contact with them.  I have no reason to.  I keep my Facebook locked down to the point that I don't show my city, my job, my phone number nothing.  But I can see all of their stuff.  This works because they post a lot and if I see that they are having problems with whatever the case maybe then I can work to make sure that if they ask for something I can not answer or just ignore them all together.  Plus it does give an open avenue for communication  in the even of  a major emergency.  Plus maybe I still hold onto a hope that they will maybe at some time they will actually apologize.  But I don't see that ever being the case. 

I have been asked if my mom has ever apologized.  No she has not.  And she never will. She is from a generation where parents don't apologize to their kids.  Because that would mean they did something wrong. She is from a generation where kids were to be seen and not heard.

I guess it comes down to this.  My family has formed this dynamic that I will never be apart of or want to be apart of.  And I'm okay with that.  I was not asked to come to Thanksgiving or Christmas.  I was told that I will be there. Why??? I don't know.  Then when I declined twice things got ugly. 

Thank you all for all your replies and support!!! ",2020-11-19 23:39:58,1083,19833,0.94,5,4,202,0,1,18,6,7,17,,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is not a big dramatic situation, but I'm curious about what people will think since this has really divided people in my life.

I (30F) work as a copywriter in a fairly competitive field. I write in English even though I'm not an English native, but I have been working in this field and in English for over 6 years. Now, a couple of years ago I was looking for a new job and having difficulty getting interviews. After some time, I realized it may have been because my last name is very typical of my country (think Martinez or similar) and people were screening me assuming my English level. To A/B test this theory, I asked my boyfriend, who is white and English-native, if I could use his last name to apply for jobs. I didn't see it as a big deal as we're planning on getting married and me taking his last name anyway. To be clear: other than the name on the CV, I made no claims to be an actual English native, just native-level, and I'm always honest about my background in interviews. 

Well, guess what? It worked. I got my current job based on that CV, and now use his last name on LinkedIn and all professional channels. Recently, I shared this story with a (white, English-native) friend of mine and they were extremely offended. Firstly they accused me of denying my culture, birth country, and trying to be white. Then they said I was lying to companies and misrepresenting myself, and that I could be stealing this job from more deserving people. He even implied that he would go to my current company and ""reveal my secret"" which is ridiculous as I've provided my ID to them, so they know that this is not my ""official"" name??

I was taken aback at how seriously angry he got at this, and I wanted to know... Am I the asshole for using my bf's last name professionally?",2020-11-12 12:00:03,1950,20015,0.96,0,1,166,0,,10,3,3,5,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At first I thought maybe he had money problem, but then overheard him laughing and bragging to someone in another department about how he was able to scam lunches out of his coworkers, and he’s attempted to bully a free meal out of someone more than once. His general entitled attitude is one of the many reasons I don’t like him.

So yesterday my girlfriend and I had lunch together. He overheard me confirming before I left and asked what I was bringing him and I said nothing. He said I brought it up, and I corrected him. No, I was confirming we were still good and he was eavesdropping on my conversation. He started complaining so I had if he gave me money for his food I’d bring him something but I wasn’t going to buy him food. He started complaining about it again and I got irritated and said no money no food, and then I left.

When I got back my boss said my coworker complained I was being hostile. I told him what happened and how he’s constantly trying to weasel free food out of people, even some of the people he knows are struggling. So my boss asked around and several others collaborated what I said. My coworker got dragged into the office and now he’s pissed that I “narc’d” and how he was just kidding. Most of the office thinks he got what he deserved but a few think it wasn’t worth getting him in trouble over.

Today no one he asked told him what they were doing for lunch, and he’s whining that we’re alienating him. I said he alienated himself because of his behavior.

She doesn’t have a car, and during her birthday weekend, thought her parents were going to buy her one. They didn’t get her one and she was pretty upset. I should note that I’m not very close with my cousin. Or the rest of my extended family for that matter. I only heard about this through the grapevine from my dad. Anyway

My cousin texts me on the Friday before her birthday asking if she can take my car (I just leased a new Ford escape) to the mall and then for an out of town road trip with her friends over the weekend. I tell her no. 

She begs and pleads with me. I tell her no again. My car is for me to drive and for me only. If she wants her own car she can save up and buy one. She calls me a bitch and says that I ruined her birthday and that she’s embarrassed because her friends think she got a car for her birthday and she doesn’t have one. I don’t respond to her and think nothing of it. 

The weekend comes and I sleep in very late on that Saturday, waking up at 1:00 pm (don’t judge lol). Even though my car is parked in my driveway and my gate is closed, I come to realize that someone egged and TP’d my car. With many, many eggs and 5-6 rolls of TP. And since the weather was warm outside, the raw egg baked into my car, along with the dried up toilet paper, destroying the paint. 

Since I have security cameras around my house, I decide to go back and watch. At around nine thirtyish that morning, I see my cousin and a bunch of her stupid friends vandalizing my car. I’m surprise she didn’t smash the windows and poke holes in the tires too.

To save my post from the 3000 character limit, I obviously pressed charges and my cousin is in legal trouble. Her and her parents are pissed off at me for pressing charges, her parents telling me that she’s “just a kid” and that she’s been through a lot of ‘emotional stress’ doing virtual schooling for this past year and that I should take that into consideration, and that I should be ashamed of myself for pressing legal charges against my baby cousin, that I’m almost 30 and dont I remember what I was like at that age? (I do remember, and I wasn’t stupid enough to egg anyone’s car) and can’t she work something out with me like doing chores around my house for money if I drop the charges... that she’s young, that she doesn’t need a felony on her record, etc. and that it was just a prank. Right after I press charges, my cousin was calling and texting me over and over saying that this could’ve been avoided had I let her take my car. 

Am I the asshole in this situation?

I need to add that my cousin already has a felony on her record, a DUI. She’s not remorseful of anything.

Also, my aunt and uncle will not pay me for the damages. They just want me to drop the charges and pay for everything myself like nothing happened. They are cheap.",2020-11-03 06:26:22,3106,25824,0.95,1,0,159,0,,13,9,6,14,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,2,2,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My son (16) was recently diagnosed with an eating disorder. It was something that had been going on for months but no one picked up on it. Since being diagnosed he has not left the house except to go to emergency doctor appointments or for some fresh air. Because of his currently fragile state, he has to be watched a lot, have his meals weighed and measured (by his newly referred dietician) and he is not allowed to exercise, which is killing him as that was his favourite thing to do. Before COVID, he used to go for runs and his high school gym with his friends and the fact that he can’t now is very upsetting to him. 

Since his diagnosis, we have had to be very careful about what we as a family say and do. Obviously with thanksgiving coming up, we knew it would be extra hard for him. For dinners every year, we would make a big deal about the food and family and friends but with COVID we limited it to our family (me, my husband and my son) my parents and my sister who lives by herself. My sister is VERY socially conscious and decided to become vegan during quarantine. She openly talks about how much better she feels about it and basically talks bad about what other people eat if it’s not vegan. 

With the diagnosis and my sons consent, we told our family what was happening and made it very clear not to talk about food in any context, including veganism. Everyone was super supportive, and my sister asked if she found still bring her own vegan food. I said yes, provided she doesn’t make a big deal about it being vegan and her own lifestyle choices. 

Cut to today. Everything was going well until dinner. I brought my son his food and we had a happy dinner until my sister brought up how her tofu was better then the turkey my son was eating. We all gave her sharp eyes, and she then went on to say that there was nothing wrong with eating turkey but tofu would make her feel less tired and stuffed after. Although my son tried to put on a brave face, he ended up running to his room and having a panic attack. 

I  was so upset with my sister that right after dinner I told her to leave. She didn’t respect my wishes or her nephews needs and for that she wasn’t welcome. I packed up her stuff and told her to go, and we spent the rest of the night with lots of tension.

So I (30F) made money young. I dropped out of college to model, then started my own business and made some smart decisions with stocks. So I have quite a bit of money saved, my own property owned free and clear (just pay utilities), and a couple cars. I am single and childless. 

Growing up, I was very close with my twin (30M) but not so much with my other siblings (also twins, 28F). Basically they were favored quite a bit by my parents. I took care of myself starting in high school and so did my twin. He paid his own way through college with no parental help while I built my business also on my own. Our younger siblings did not. Our parents bought them cars in high school, paid 100% of their tuition and living expenses in college, and supported them in starting their adults lives. Both my sisters ended up in bad relationships where they had kids that the fathers eventually had nothing to do with. My parents have always given them plenty of money and support. 

I just got diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor. It’s inoperable and I am going to die within six months. I have made my peace with it. I opted to leave everything to my brother in my will. That was he can pay off his student loans and have a vehicle and home free and clear. I want to know he has a good life while I’m gone. 

My parents and sisters found out that I’m leaving everything to him and flipped out. They accused me of favoritism and being a bad daughter, aunt, and sister. They said my parents deserved money for raising me, and that my nieces and nephews deserved my money for future expenses since their mothers couldn’t afford things like cars and college. Even my grandma and my uncle’s wife who I barely see messaged me on Facebook to tell me how selfish I’m being. 

I blocked all of them in Facebook and told my brother I only wanted him to be at my bedside while I died.

I had known her most of my life we grew up together and were engaged for 2 years. We wanted to get married sooner but she got sick and never recovered after that despite doing all we could to fight this God awful disease.

My late fiancee had a diary that I gifted her right after she was diagnosed. She was the type that'd get very emotional and would have a difficulty expressing her feelings and opening up about her issues. She was very thankful I brought her the dairy and she told me I was the only one who really understood what she needed and how she felt. I'd see her spending a lot of time writing in her dairy wether at the hospital or at home. I never read it while she was alive but she let me have it a week before she passed away. I had a hard time looking at it and I left it untouched for over a year after her death. That's when I started reading it. I brought it up in therapy and it helped me tremendously.

I don't have much of her stuff. But I still have her diary with me. I'm now engaged to my fiancee who I met via a mutual friend and she was wonderful when I met her.

My current fiancee and I are open to each other. We'd talk about what bothers us all the time but at the same time there are things that I'd rather not share nor talk about. I'm getting better at communicating but I'm taking my time.

My current fiancee knows about my late fiancee's diary. Despite her asking to see it and I have no idea why she'd want that but I made it clear that I have no intentions on sharing what's in it with her. It's not like it's a secret but I know my late fiancee would want me to keep it that way.

My fiancee kept bringing it up. Knowing how uncomfortable that made me feel. And yesterday I got home and found out that she took the dairy and read it. I was absolutely pissed she didn't even deny it. Even tried to argue with me about why I was lashing out at her. Even though she disrespected my boundaries. She even refused to acknowledge that couples should have personal boundaries. I yelled at her for being so inconsiderate and for touching the diary in the first place. She got upset that I reacted like this and refused to talk to me for hours.

He has been with his boyfriend for four years and they are talking about marriage within the next two or three years. 

My inlaws are extremely religious and intolerant and my son has never felt comfortable coming out to them. He has no real relationship with them other than holiday/birthday pleasantries and we support his decision. We aren't particularly close to them either for reasons I will not get into here, but my husband feels like the less contact we have with them, the better.

My MIL has this bad habit with my son where she is constantly trying to involve herself in his dating life and has in the past tried to set him up with women she either met at church or on the street. One time she tried to set him up with waitress when we went out to dinner with them for her birthday.

The other night he was over at the house and MIL called up my husband (44M) on skype. My son participated in the call to give his Thanksgiving pleasantries. My MIL began harping at him about when he was finally going to settle down and find a nice girl to marry so she will get to be a great-grandma. She told him that one of her friends from church has a daughter that he would like and asked if she could give her his number. My son told her he wasn't interested and asked her to stop. She kept persisting and my son finally told her that he was gay and had a serious boyfriend he was living with and planned to marry. MIL flipped her shit! 

She ended the skype and immediately called my husband and started screaming at him. She told my husband that our son was a disgrace to our family, and started chastising him for not telling her about our sons sinful life. My hsuband told her that is is not our place to tell people that our son is gay, and if she cannot support him, than she is a worse grandmother than she was a mother and should be ashamed of herself. 

My FIL and SIL are now demanding that we apologize to MIL for upsetting her and ruining their Thanksgiving. My husband and I are standing firm that we have nothing to apologize for, and if anything feel that they should apologize to our son for the awful things they said about him and his boyfriend.

I was talking about what happened with my sister, and she told me that this would have never happened if we had told my MIL years ago that our son was gay.

We have been friends for 5 years now and we were talking about the some fun things we did in school. Our school is on a huge piece of land and we found some planks and build a huge fort with a lot of our friends and it was our secret paradise where we would sleep during breaks or just chat a lot. We talked for hours about memories it was just like ""You remember when ........"" . It was a nice trip down memory lane.

My parents were pretty happy and they wanted to do the same thing but I honestly couldn't think of one positive memory I had with them. I used to run and hide because I was so scared of my dad.  I also remembered going through homework with my mom and it being a huge blow to my self esteem as she would call me stupid and worthless. I remembered trying to unplug my dad's Mac charger and getting electrocuted but the charger got spoilt and I was punished for spoiling the charger since it was expensive. I told them I cannot remember a positive memory and maybe they can help me remember. 

They talked about teaching me how to write but that was a negative memory to me since I was basically being threatened through out the process. They mentioned playing pranks like pretending they were angry at me but that was negative to me because I was just scared. They called me unappreciative and said that they were sorry they could not make me happy condescending.  Now I am wondering if I was the asshole, I am not saying I needed expensive vacations to have positive memories or anything like that, I  had positive memories in science class and I have positive memories of my older sister carrying me on her shoulders when I was little but all I remember is being scared of what my parents would do to me to the point I even flinch when someone give me a high five. I remember my friends asking me why I am scared of a high five when I flinch when they are going to high five me.

Edit:I corrected some spelling mistakes.

I asked my sister if she has good memories with our parents and she said she does but she has more bad than good ones with our parents, she also mentioned that she only remembered them because of random things like seeing the Nokia logo reminded her of our parents setting up her first phone and when she heard some Daft Punk songs it reminded her of us in the car going to visit our grandma.

She’s the first grandchild on either side so obviously everyone is all over her. We’ll call my baby Daisy

Both my parents and my in laws gave us different outfits for thanksgiving at different times. My parents gave me a little onesie and a overall dress with a turkey on it. It was pretty cute. 

My mother in law on the other hand gave us a onesie and a pair of pants, and the onesie said “I’m here because moms turkey got stuffed.” (I actually got rid of it because that’s gross)

We decided to split thanksgiving between the houses (everyone quarantined beforehand, tested negative, etc) and my mother in law immediately saw that Daisy wasn’t wearing the shirt she bought, and asked what had happened. I tried to dodge the question because I don’t want to cause a tense situation, but my mother in law kept badgering me about it, not even wanting to hold Daisy because she wasn’t wearing her outfit. 

Thanksgiving lunch was really tense and when we left, my mother in law texted me and said it was very rude that Daisy wasn’t wearing the outfit she bought her and demanded to know why. I finally told her it was because I didn’t want to put my 2 month old in a shirt that had a sexual innuendo on it, and looking back at photos of her first holiday, I didn’t want that outfit involved. She called me a killjoy and rude so I just left her on read. 

I feel like I’m the asshole because i could have just humored her for an hour and not have documented the outfit and that it was a gift.

My fiancé says he supported not putting Daisy in the outfit, and that it made him feel gross too.

I’m (16m) half Mexican from my dad’s side and my mom’s side is Scottish. Ngl most of my mom’s family is high key racist and is been problems sometimes growing up. My grandma on my mom’s side never liked my dad and was happy after they divorced when I was 7.

My names Emiliano and my grandma always complained how hard she tried to change my parents minds and it’s a shame I got stuck with it. I’m actually proud of it. My dad told me about the revolutionary I was named after and their history.

But literally my entire life my grandma refuses to say it. She says it’s “too many syllables” (i got a cousin named Alexandria and they say the whole name) and always came up with her own names. She says Leo or once tried to get everyone to call me “Elliot” as a nickname for a while. Obvious my moms family was for it but my dad refused that cause it’s not my name. 

Is always the same thing when I see them. She’ll call me Leo or whatever. Even when I correct her she says it’s not a big deal an keeps calling wrong name. I told my mom I don’t like it but she always say I’m just not gonna change her mind and no point in fighting it.

So I decided if she not gonna wanna call me by my actual name in not gonna call her grandma or say her right name. Is stupid I know but it’s bothering me more that she don’t care and all my other cousins she says their names fine, no nicknames. 

Her name is Susan so I decided to call her Sandy.  

Tbh I was scared to say it but that look on her face was worth it lmao. It wasn’t surprise Pikachu face but it was close. She said that is not how I address her and it’s “grandma”. I told her nah I’mma call her sandy from now until she says my actual name.

It got awkward. My mom was serious and my gma got super red in the face. She started ranting about me being a fucking disrespectful child and this is all my dad influencing me again. My mom told me I need to apologize immediately but idk what gave me the balls to not do it. We ended up leaving there house early and my mom didn’t talk to me until we got home. 

She say what I did was outta line and I don’t disrespect my elders ever. She wants me to apologize and I’m grounded until I do. Haven’t talked to my dad yet about this since it just happened but I wanted to ask if it was being an asshole or was it okay for this situation to “insult my grandmother” ?",2020-11-01 09:20:20,2943,30163,0.96,0,0,156,0,1,17,11,12,15,,26,,,,,,,,,,3,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13,,,1,,,,,,,,,2,4,,3,,,,,,5,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I swear Tiktok is like 90% cringy edgy preteens and teens, military, and creepy old men talking to the preteens. 

Anyways my girlfriend makes a lot of tiktoks about how much she misses me and about army girlfriend stuff. She’ll post stuff like #armygf 

She also has a rather large following, in the tens of thousands and pretty much everyone in my unit and on base knows about this, and they non stop give me shit about it. My commanding officer will roast me in front of everyone. I checked the followers list and almost all her followers were other servicemen, most of whom are probably on our base. All the comments on her posts are people I know roasting me. 

So here’s some of the tiktoks she’s made. She’s done the classic “I’m coming home” song which plays over her hugging me when she meets me. There’s millions of those on tiktok. SHe’s posted tiktoks about how she upgraded when she dated me, putting pictures of me and her ex together, how she went from dating a boy to a man.

I'll explain the situation very quickly and I'll do my best to not leave out important details.

I (F33) been married for over 7 years and I been struggling with health issues that prevented me from having a healthy pregnancy. I've miscarried 3 times and both me and my husband are becoming frustrated And we've literally lost any hope. This has clearly become a sensitive topic for us and I can't help but feel absolutely horrible whenever I think about it.

My brother Sam and his fiancee have been together for two years now, she's a bit rude and would constantly bring up the fact that I can't have kids by making backhanded comments. for example she told my mom and dad after i miscarried for the second time that the family won't have any grandchildren til she and my brother have kids. And talked about how much pressure I must be feeling since the ""clock was ticking"" because women over thirty have less chances of having healthy pregnancy.

Even implied that my husband will eventually leave since he ""had a right"" to have his own kids since I can't give him that. As a result I've distanced myself from my brother and my family because she was present at their house the whole time behaving like this.

I had my third miscarriage this past week and I'm still dealing with complications both physically and mentally. I got a text from my brother's fiancee the next day. Literally after I got out of the hospital that she was sorry I miscarried and that she was happy to tell me she was pregnant. In the same text.

I couldn't help but notice the sarcasm in her text especially when she decided to invite me to my own parents house to celebrate completely disregarding what I just experienced.

I showed it to my husband then I blocked her immediately. She found out and she told my whole family. Told them that I blocked her right after I found out she was pregnant and used the fact that I didn't visit because I was being resentful and jealous. My brother was angry that I blocked her. He told me I was clearly being bitter and disrespectful. (My brother keeps parroting her words and won't even see anything wrong with her behavior. It's always been like this but now it's worse since she's pregnant and everyone is trying to please her) That I ruined this for them and that I shouldn't hate on my future niece/nephew out of spite.

Both my mom and dad weren't happy with what I did. Mom even tried to say my husband made me do this because we're too bitter to be happy for my brother and his fiancee. The extended family heard the news and said they were shocked I did this saying that I'm always known to be a nice person who doesn't pull this type of nonsense.

I didn't feel like what I did was wrong, but now I do, I feel so horrible but given how she treated me in the past I figured she did this deliberately.",2020-11-23 16:08:13,1027,9865,0.96,0,0,283,0,,5,2,7,8,,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I bought a house prior to covid and so during the lockdowns I was able to get some really cheap contracting done because people needed work.  I got it fixed up to rent it out, not to my mom, but just anybody.  

When it became clear people were losing jobs I didn’t want to rent to a stranger just to kick them out:  so I kept renovating at a slow pace just to keep the house on the ups.

Fast forward.  I find out my mom is being evicted for not paying rent.  I refuse to send my mom money.  I used to and it damn near made me broke.  She has a gambling addiction and drinking problem.  She lost her job.  

So I tell her I have a friend who owns a house one state over.   With nothing to lose she found a job out of state, applied With an agent I know out there who handled the beginning part but really it’s my house and she wouldn’t have been approved otherwise 

I rent it to her at below market rate but enough to where I know she’s not wasting all money on gambling and drinking.  My brother and his son also live there. She didn’t tell “management” that go figure.  

So my wife is like, I want to go see the house.  I tell her what I did and she doesn’t seem to understand that I never told my mom it’s my house and why.  As soon as I tell her it’s my house she’s going to go back to being irresponsible and it’s bad enough my brother is freeloading there too but this is going to be a financial burden on us if we tell her.

When I moved into this house with these other two women I got the master suite since I was willing to pay more for it. It came with an extra closet and an adjoining bathroom.

What I didn’t realize until after we started moving in is that the door to the extra closet in the master bedroom was like five inches thick with a small keypad on the outside and a large locking mechanism on the back. The inside was set up with shelves and stuff like a closet though. 

The owner explained that it was actually a panic room, but they had always just used it as a closet. He did give me the code to it though. Since then I started using the room as a sort of safe and keep my valuables and other private stuff in there. I love being able to have a place in the house that I know no one else can access. There’s something comforting about that since this is my first time living with roommates.

Anyway there’s been a couple break ins around town. Now my roommates want to have the code to the panic room. Especially my one roommate, Emily, who has a daughter. Emily says her daughters really freaked out by the recent event and the idea of having a panic room helped her calm down and get to sleep.

Both roommates are saying it’s an amenity of the house and they should have access to it. I however think it’s an amenity of the master suite as it was advertised as an extra closet in the master suite. I also feel very uncomfortable with them having the code to it and being able to access the things I keep in there. So Im refusing to give them the code. I actually called the landlord and asked him not to give them the code and he agreed.

So now they’re saying I’m being a jerk and if something happens to them it will be my fault.",2020-11-24 16:57:46,1048,7052,0.97,42,24,91,1,,1,,1,2,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My oldest is 6 and my youngest is 2. My sister (31f) has two daughters ages 9 and 7. Up until a year and a half ago we lived in different states. Then she moved back and I started spending some more time with my nieces and it was horrible.

1st time: Took all the kids to McDonald's and the oldest threw a fit because she didn't get the toy she wanted. She was yelling and saying I needed to buy her another meal to get her the toy. She tantrumed all the way back to my sisters house. During this the youngest kept throwing food too and wouldn't stop when told to.

2nd time: My sister and I took the kids to the zoo. The youngest spat in my oldest's ice cream because he got the last of the flavor she wanted. My sister made very little deal out of it and shrugged it off. The oldest told my oldest that's the reason you give them what they want.

3rd time: Was going shopping, sister asked me to take the girls for the afternoon because things came up, had them in the car and they both threw a fit because they didn't want to go grocery shopping and then they kept kicking the cart when I was going around. The youngest tried to break something so we would be made leave. I stepped in to discipline many times and got told I was not their mom and they didn't have to listen to me. I ended up dropping them back with their dad.

4th time: Brought all four kids to the park and they didn't want to stay because they thought we were going to a water park. They did everything they could to ruin my oldest having fun and then when I pulled them back and said if they couldn't play nice or entertain themselves, which I tried to get them to do, they would run in different directions and yell. So we left after less than half an hour.

Final time: They were at my house so my sister and her husband could have a date night. They wouldn't eat the food I prepared (nuggets and fries) because they wanted pizza. They didn't want apple pie they wanted chocolate cake for dessert. They were spitting in everyone else's food and throwing it on the floor. I got the same attitude when giving discipline and they started yelling when they weren't getting their way. This lasted all night. They wouldn't go to bed. Didn't sleep. Woke both my kids up.

Each time I sat and spoke to my sister and she seemed to take it seriously, especially after I pointed it out after the zoo incident, and then the last time she shrugged it off as kids will be kids. And I told her if that's how they behave then I'm not going to have them in my home or take them anywhere. She said that was fine. Then after she returned to work post-lockdown she asked me to help out in a few emergencies which I said no to and she called me an ass for not helping. But the way they behave I am not willing to sign up for that. Especially if she's going to shrug it off.

AITA?

I wanted to add this here because more than one person has brought up why I would give them so many chances and subject my kids to them. It's because I was happy to finally be more active in their lives and I have always loved having a big family around us. We grew up with a lot of cousins and sometimes they spent time at our house and we spent time at theirs. I wanted that for my kids. So yes, I let it go on too long for my own kids sake because I kept hoping my sister was serious and the next time would be better but it never got better and eventually I do have to put my kids first and say enough is enough, which is what happened.

I am sad that it ended up like this though.

Adding some more details here that have come up along the way (also thank you for all the responses. I was not expecting it and I am relieved to see them all). My parents have had some bad experiences with them too. Throwing food on the floor, yelling at them, being demanding and rude. In my parents house they never spat but there was an incident in their own home where my sister decided my dad should get the bigger steak and the oldest did not like that and so, yeah, you don't need me to go into details. My parents were horrified. They're still horrified. They would never have allowed us to behave anything like that and at their ages it's just awful.

I don't know of any specific issues. Part of me is wondering if there is a reason they moved back here. Maybe it's just my negative mind after everything but maybe they lost all their support there? Maybe they had babysitters and help there but his family got tired of it and refused because of the behavior? No way would that behavior come out of nowhere but I wasn't around enough when they were little to know if they were acting out like that or not. Otherwise it sounds like they just get away with doing whatever they want and so they never learned how to stop. I am aware they've had some issues in school but I don't know any details really. I can't imagine they would get away with the spitting though. No way would a school tolerate that.",2020-11-23 09:15:46,944,10027,0.97,2,0,256,0,,2,2,2,4,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am not talking about being a little cranky when hungry. She would cry and scream and even break things if dinner gets delayed by half an hour. 

During her last visit, work was very hectic for me and Mark. Mark had to go to office while I WFH. Since I knew how busy I would be end of day and how Jennifer gets, I woke up early prepare breakfast, lunch and dinner. I informed her the same. 

End of day, I am in so many meeting and calls and Jennifer barged in 15 past her dinner time and told me serve her dinner. I reminded her that the dinner was in the fridge and all she had to do was heat it up. 

She comes back 15 mins later and told me that she threw the food away and now she wanted me to give her a snack for the time being and make her something else. I told her that I am not going to do that and then locked myself inside the study. 

I could hear her screaming and crying and I refused to give in. Once my work was done (2 hours later), she was still crying. She never heated the dinner. She tried it cold, didn't like it, threw the ENTIRE dinner for 3 away and then started demanding me for a freshly cooked dinner. 

She begged me to cook her something and I told her that I already did cook her something and that she threw it away. I told her she can either cook for herself or wait until her father comes home and he can cook for her.

I went to bed hungry as I was so tired. Next day, Mark told me that he didn't get home until midnight and she was still sobbing when he arrived. Although he agrees that Jennifer was acting entitled, he also says that I should have just cooked her something once my work was done as I knew about her food issues instead of letting her cry for hours. 

I got pissed off and told him that I am not cooking for either of them anymore.

AITA here?

My neighbor, 38F (super vegan) has 2 kids. I (26F) also have 2 kids. 

My apartment complex didn’t do traditional tick or treating on Halloween.

Residents were advised to set out prepackaged individual candy bags on their patios/front door areas if they wanted to participate- but the traditional “knock on door, physically hand strangers candy” was not permitted.

So, Halloween comes and the kids are all dressed up and each building has a scheduled time where the kids go door to door. I ended up having to work late so my neighbor offered to walk my kids around with hers at our buildings scheduled time. About 45 minutes later my kids came home with a small bucket of candy (6 little goodie bags each from individual apartments that participated) everything was fine, and my kids didn’t say anything weird had happened. They were just excited to eat candy once they got home lol.

The next day I took my kids to the park directly across from our apartment complex. My neighbor was there with her kids as well. The kids were playing and she took out one of those individual goodie bags with candy in it from her purse and started to loudly rummage in it. She ate several pieces of candy and my daughter eventually noticed, ran up and asked if she could have a piece and my neighbor responded “nope, this is my tax candy, remember that This was my reward for taking you trick or treating last night” 
I was a little weirded out by that statement and asked what she meant.

She said that since she Is the one who had to take the kids out, she took FIVE bags from each of my kids as a “tax.”

Her son then chimes in and said “you only took two bags from us!” 
she responded with “but I’m your mom, I was doing OP a favor so they get a higher candy tax” 

I was thinking about how to respond when I noticed that she was holding a starburst candy and decided to just smile and nod and go back to watching my kids. I let her continue To finish off the bag of candy and then said “hey, aren’t you vegan? You know a lot of those candies are made with animal products right. “

I explained what gelatin was and how a LOT of those candies are made with it.

She was horrified, googles it and then told her kids that they were leaving. She said something about how she was going to be sick and stormed off. 

Now she’s giving me dirty looks every time we see her and won’t let her kids play if she shows up at the park and we are there.

My husband thinks I’m an asshole cause I should have either- not said anything about the gelatin, or said something right away when I noticed. 

I don’t think it’s my job to tell a vegan what is and isn’t vegan though, and she deserved it for stealing candy from little kids.

Edit #1 when we got home from the park after the gelatin incident, I sat my kids down and asked why they didn’t tell me that the neighbor took half of their candy. My oldest kid is six and my youngest kid is four. Six year old explained that as they went door-to-door during their designated trick-or-treating time she would have my four year old grab two bags instead of one from each apartment for the majority of them, she explained it to my kids that they were grabbing extra bags for her to be handed over at the end as taxation. So either freaking way she was directly taking candy from my kids or taking candy *from other kids through* mine. 

As for the authenticity of her vegansim- 
I may have exaggerated when I said “super vegan” when I first posted this. She claims to be vegan and is very, very in peoples faces about the benefits etc. it’s 100% about the health side- she brags about veganism curing cancer, diabetes, even some mental health issues. I have never once heard her talk about the benefits for animals. She also sells herbal tea products, customized gym clothing etc. so she totes a pretty big vegan “lifestyle” if that makes sense. 

Now for the gelatin. She knows what gelatin is, she knows what it’s made out of, she knows that there are obvious things that she can’t eat. But she had no idea that a lot of candy specifically had gelatin apparently. When I told her that they had gelatin in it, she knew what gelatin was but googled the candies to see if I was correct.

I think she is either really dumb or she eats non vegan stuff all the time when no ones watching and had to pretend to be horrified about it at this point, cause a lot of you guys have pointed out that you literally can’t be vegan and not know these things. I’m not vegan, I’m not even freaking vegetarian and I know these things. 

About the starbursts: a lot of you have said that starburst are vegan friendly. However starburst in the USA are made with animal gelatin. In the UK they ARE vegan though! ;)

EDIT #2 
I cannot thank you guys enough for all the insight on this, and if it weren’t for you all commenting and me being able to show my husband, he probably wouldn’t have told me what was actually wrong. 
Turns out he was calling me an asshole cause she’s been parking in his assigned parking spot and giving him dirty looks since this happened. I had no idea because I work from home and haven’t used the car in days. He finally told me why he was so grumpy about what I did. He hates confrontation and was miss placing his anger at me. I’m gonna talk to her about it first, then management if it doesn’t stop. 

I also bought several bags of candy that our entire family has been snacking on since lol.",2020-11-06 03:26:56,1954,28077,0.91,4,0,77,1,,16,9,8,14,,16,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He's recently went back to work (he's a chef) and I'm still on furlough (I co-manage a bar.)

I cook from scratch everyday. I've recently let the little one (3 in March) scoop the chopped up food into the cold pot .

Chopped up carrots? She giggles and scoops then into the pot. Mushrooms? Giggles and scoops them into the pot. Onions, giggles and scoops then in. (I wash her hands after. )

Husband was home four nights ago watching us, making sarky little comments, 'she's too young' and 'you're cooking them wrong' etc.

He tried to get her to play with her blocks, which are her favourite toy at the moment, and she said to him

'No daddy, we do dinner, don't be nasty!'

He hasn't spoken to me properly since then. His dad has emailed me saying I should take the lead from my husband (since he knows best.) His brothers have texted saying I should just pick my battles. 

I told him if he couldn't have an adult conversation with me he should go and stay with his daddy. He left a couple of hours later, told me he would stay with his dad. He told our daughter he had to go to work. She was happy. 

I think I'm totally in the right. My little one wants to help. She is very proud of herself when dinner is ready because she helped cook it. 

I do kinda feel bad because I know how chef's can be. But come on, it's his daughter, he should be encouraging her!",2020-11-20 21:39:22,988,13772,0.96,0,2,201,0,1,7,4,4,3,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am one of 7 people not participating. Lots of preggos, some bodybuilders, and people who maintained their weight who aren't interested. Since I've visibly gained, they thought I'd want to participate. I didn't. Jen, in charge of everything, kept dropping by to remind me to turn in my form and my money.

I  said ""No thanks."" Jen wouldn't drop it. Other people got involved, asking me why not all the time, it'll be fun! Don't be scared, I'd ""feel better"" and ""look better"" (I told them no, I wouldn't) and it's a great way to bond, we're all in it together, it's like Weight Watchers!

""I'm not interested,"" and then eventually, ""I. Said. No. Drop it."" They decided I wanted them to convince me. Two weeks into the bet, they tried to trick on the scale to ""shock"" me. 

I contacted HR, people finally backed down. I'm eating my food one day (rice and beans), people sitting with me start dropping hints that how they feel so much better now that they aren't eating carby comfort food all the time. 

I said ""I'm glad you feel better.""

They took this as a sign that I ""knew"" I'd ""feel better"" again and started up saying I could still join in. I finally fucking snapped and said ""You guys suck. I'm a recovering anorexic. I get one whiff of competition and start starving myself for days and start puking up what I do eat until I'd have to get my third oral surgery to remove rotting teeth. Does that sound worth it to you?""

Chorus of ""wow"" and ""we were just joking.""

I said ""No, you weren't *just joking*. Congratulations, by the way. After you all wouldn't stop, I weighed myself for the first time in seven years and didn't eat for two days. Does that make you all *feel good*?""

None of them would look me in the eye, so I just went home for the day. I got a call from the women in HR, who were shockingly supportive of me. One of the bodybuilder guys stepped up and said he's witnessed a lot of the harassment and he doesn't blame me for my outburst. A few others did too. 

However, they had to cancel the diet bet (I didn't ask them to) and people are blaming me. Saying that I can't take a joke, it wasn't ""that deep"" and the girls present said they no longer feel ""safe"" working with me because I obviously have mental issues. One of them made a big stink about ""politically correct bullshit"" and how I'm the typical hypersensitive milennial. 

I go back and forth on this all day, thinking I should have just swallowed my anger and gone back to HR or just stopped eating lunch in the office or whatever. I didn't mean to ruin anyone's fun but I also feel justified in pushing back on their harassment.

He had a three year old daughter and his wife passed away in a car accident the year before. Even that young, I could tell my mothers attention was not on me but my stepsister. She catered to her every need saying it’s because she needs a mother figure, which I get. She was enrolled in many sports as a kid while I wasn’t in any because there wasn’t even money (she did 3, I did none). My mom would buy her the newest clothes and shoes and technology and I would have her hand me downs. She basically treated my stepsister like her daughter and I was an afterthought. While my stepsister had my mom and her dad, I had nobody. My dad was never in my life. They would go on family vacations without me. My stepdad loved that my mom prioritized his daughter over me. When I was ten they decided they couldn’t give my stepsister the attention she deserved with me in the house so they sent me away to live my with aunt in a different state. 


For three years my mom had basically no contact with me. I would answer the phone and it was always my stepdad or stepsister. My stepsister would say her “moms” busy and hang up. She would tell me to stop calling because if my mom wanted to talk to me, she wouldn’t have sent me away. I went six months without talking to my mom once. My aunt hated my mom for the way she treated me and told me I deserved better so she basically became a surrogate parent. When I was thirteen she ended up passing away from complications from a disease she had been suffering from. I was so heartbroken and my mom reluctantly allowed me to move back in after consulting with other family members to see if they would take me... 


I tried to justify it to myself as a teen that maybe she just doesn’t want to a mom but she WAS a mom... to my stepsister. She would post her accomplishments on social media, parade her around the family as her “golden child”, she even said she thinks my stepsister looks more like her than I do. I remember as a kid before they married my mom was so attentive and loving. Then she chose my stepdad and stepsister over me. I’m now sixteen and I hate my life because of them three. My stepsister is a bitch and whenever I bring up the differences in which we’re treated, she says her mom is dead and I’m selfish for not wanting to share my mom. Yesterday we got into an argument after she went through my clothes and she said I’m unwanted and that my mom is more of a mom to her than she is to me, IN FRONT OF MY MOM WHO SMILED THEN LOOKED AT ME TO SEE HOW I WOULD REACT. I said “Your mom might have died, but I also lost my mom too. You can have her, I’m already an orphan in my eyes”. My stepsister started crying saying that I’m disgusting for saying my mom is gone when actually it’s her mom that died.

My husband is a SAHD and he nails it, the house is always in a perfect state of cleanness, his food is delicious, his coffee is the nectar of the gods and he is an extremely talented handy man who can fix or build anything from scratch. I am exactly opposite when it comes to domestic skills so for me he is a blessing and since I have a six figures paying job is not a problem that he stays at home, especially now that I work from home most days of the week, I am in heaven. Since I am the sole provider for both of us I give him a monthly allowance to be his fun money and he is more than happy with this because he is a frugal man and don’t have the most expensive hobbies, like he loves wood work and is very good at it.

So after our daughter moved out of the house to go to college in another state he has been a little bored at home, since taking care of our daughter was what consumed most of his time and due to complications during my labor we decided to stop at the one kid mark, pets are out of question because both of us are allergic to fur, so to kill his extra time he got a part time job at a local store on retail, you should had seen his eyes when he showed me his first pay check and said that he would do the same as me, put half on the household account and put the rest on our retirement fund I almost felt tempt to say to him to keep all the money from himself but he was looking me with puppy eyes so I said yes (and secretly increased his allowance), also I know the owner of the place and he is more than grateful of having my husband there because he’s not only great at interactions with the clients, but also because nobody is stupid enough to scream at a giant polar bear.

I think is better if I go to the point now, his dad always gave him shit for him being a stay at home dad even having an engineering degree (degree which has paid solely by my husband trough scholarships and him working to the bone during college) and that his was a waste, my husband never gave a f\*\*\* about his father because his father is a POS wo ruined three marriages, including his own (he was having multiples affairs with multiple married woman’s).

Long story short, my FIL got wind that my husband got a part time job and since my husband won’t listen to him he is pressuring me to pressure my husband to get a real job and be a real man, I obviously told him to go suck an egg, but when I talk about this with my friends they side with FIL and say that is strange that my husband is a SAHD and I fell conflicted because I love to have him at home and he is happy being at home, but I also fell that I am holding him back.

I (16m) dyed my hair orange yesterday, my sister is in school for cosmetology and she wanted to try dying my hair and offered me $20 so i said sure, and she dyed my hair a bright orange, looking straight up like ichigo from bleach being an asian dude with bright orange hair. personally i like it, it looks nice, and my sister did a pretty good job and she's pretty proud of herself too so that's a bonus in my mind (she has had self esteem issues in the past)

so today i go to school, i get compliments on my hair and i was just kinda glowing. when i was at my locker, a classmate who is ginger approached me and said it wasn't cool that i dyed my hair orange, and that i was ""mocking him"". so i turned and asked what the heck he was talking about, mocking him? i barely talked to this dude before, we had like 1 class together in 9th grade.

he goes on to say that he gets bullied for being a ginger and that me dying my hair orange was an ""attack"" on him since i wouldn't be bullied for having orange hair.

so, i started laughing and said it was ridiculous that he thinks i'm ""attacking"" him for having my hair dyed orange. how does that even make any sense, like if i knew someone was being bullied for having orange hair why would i then decide to die my own hair orange. he kinda just went quiet and walked away leaving me pretty confused.

My mother is extremely controlling. She doesn’t think your birthday should be celebrated if it falls on a holiday, so myself and my older sister (22F) who’s birthday is sometimes on Easter will sometimes not be acknowledged at all because “your birthday isn’t a holiday.” And she will kick people out if they wished us a happy birthday. It’s ridiculous. This isn’t even the most controlling thing she does.  If you get upset, you’re the problem and how dare you hurt her feelings?

*Obligatory throwaway account.* Earlier this year I (26f) got an inheritance from a family member and it was a godsend. I finally got to move out and get my own place after living paycheck to paycheck. MY DREAM PLACE. I could never get a place like this without providence or cutting my way through the corporate ladder with a machete. But the most important part is the pool. I love it, I'd swim every day if the weather let me. It has helped me get in great shape. 

The problem comes from the neighbors. Mark(fake name) and Kaylie(faker name but it's something like that) have 3 kids: Brad(16m) Chad(14m) and Lea(11f). They started out friendly enough, especially Kaylie who's dripping with housewife, yoga, PTA energy. She told me about a week after I moved in over a plate of cookies that the prior owners of the house were an older couple who let her kids use the pool whenever they wanted because their kids were out of the house and they didn't like quiet. I, on the other hand, LOVE quiet. I am introverted, I love my privacy, first thing I did when I moved in was put up curtains. I told her I was uncomfortable with that arrangement, but perhaps they could come over ***OCCASIONALLY*** if they don't abuse the privilege.

Cue the children abusing the privilege all summer. Every time I was out swimming, it would not be long before Chad and Brad would run over and jump in, followed by Lea with her floaties. And being teenage boys, they'd always want to roughhouse, or gape at me or my friends when we'd get out of the pool and make gross comments. This would be tolerable if it happened once a week. They even brought friends a couple of times, and more than a couple of times I've had to tell them they need to leave cause I was with adults doing adult things (drinking, etc).

So now I'm putting up a fence, for two reasons: 1.I'm getting a dog. 2.I want my privacy. Kaylie ran out of their house when she saw me and a couple of friends hammering in the fence and digging holes for privacy hedges(I made sure everything was within regulation and right on the property line). She said if I put up a fence it'd be harder for her kids to come over and play. I said yup. She asked if I was planning on putting a gate between our yards. I said nope. Finally she asked, a little choked up, if I was depriving her kids of our pool. ""OUR"" POOL?? I told her how in the beginning I had said they could use the pool as long as they did not abuse the privilege, and they did. I said now they can only come over if invited.

She told me they were going to be crushed and saw me as a big sister, I told her no teenage boy looks at their sister the way those boys looked at me and my friends. She took huge offense to that, and it might have been gross to hear, but so were the comments on my bikini from her boys. It's too much. I'm not their babysitter, and I have every right to my privacy, but some people have been saying the fence is too much and I'm going to hurt the kids' feelings.

For privacy reasons, I’ll refer to my youngest brother (12m) as “Y” and other brother (19m) as “O.”

I’m struggling with an eating disorder that has significantly affected my weight, Brother Y is considered obese for his age/height, and Brother O has a lanky build with a high metabolism. Despite us three weighing roughly the same amount, we obviously have different frames.

Now, my parents had a small Thanksgiving dinner with the five of us and invited my aunt (43f) and her husband over. Everything was going well. We were having a good time, enjoying our food, sharing laughs, etc. It was a good night up until my aunt decided to talk about our weight.

My aunt pointed out that this is the first time she’s seen me eat an “entire meal” since my stillbirth. Bringing up a traumatic experience that I’m still grieving from (surely) made the atmosphere in the house intense. I didn’t want to ruin the dinner though so I laughed it off and tried to shift the focus on to something else.

But of course, she insisted on talking about it. She said that if I was in between Brother O and Brother Y’s weight, I’d be physically healthier. I found the comment to be unnecessary and ignorant because (like I mentioned before) us three weigh nearly the same amount.

Brother O didn’t pay much mind to what she said but I saw that Brother Y was visibly upset. He struggles with his self-esteem so when I saw that he was on the verge of crying, I told everyone that we should wrap up Thanksgiving. This made my mom hostile towards me because I was being “disrespectful” to my aunt and “needed to pipe down.”

After a moment of awkward silence, I grabbed my belongings and told Brother Y that we should leave to the “store” before it closes. The house is quiet, things are uncomfortable, and Brother Y and I head out. We didn’t go to the store but we did hangout at the beach for a bit and talked.

When I came by the house to drop him off, my parents refused to open the door. So now here I am, at my apartment with my little brother who finally went to bed after crying his eyes out. I did get an angry voicemail from my mom. It was pretty brutal. She told me not to bring him back until we both apologize to her and my aunt.

I know could’ve reacted and handle things better. I was just too caught up in getting my Brother Y away from them.

He survived but it was very close and my mum bought a 3 person burial site in our local cemetery just in case he died so that one day we could be buried together. 

About 5 years after his cancer scare my mum died in an accident at work. Pretty much immediately after my step mum came into the picture. It was pretty clear from the get go that she was only interested in dad because of mum life insurance plus the accidental death payout. She had 2 kids from prior marriages(dad was her third). My dad was devastated from losing mum and I think he just saw my step mum as an easy person to comfort him. I absolutely do not blame his for the shit she put me through. 

My preteen and teen years sucked because of her, I was continuously bullied by her kids and her, I wasn't allowed to join sports teams or socialize after school. If I wasn't studying then I was cleaning and if I protested then I would go without meals. 

My dad died about 8 years after mum did and my step mum immediately kicked me out. I was only 15 at the time. There was a huge fight over my dads assets because he left almost everything to me. 

Long story short she has just died. Her children have approached me and asked that she be buried next to dad and mum. I have refused. They're now lambasting me all over SM and to mutual friends accusing me of being mean and that she was dads wife and should be buried next to him.

I live with my parents and sister(23), who is a single mother(for now that is, complicated) of a 2 year old.

I woke up at 1pm on Sunday after binging a series of movies the previous night, cleaned myself, ate something and went back to my room. At around 4pm my sister stormed into my room and screamed at me. I was confused at first but then understood that she had left my niece in the house and I was supposed to babysit her.

I don't mind babysitting but as, but I didn't remember her telling me anything about babysitting the previous day. She told me to check my phone and there it was - a text previous night from her telling me that she would be out next morning and asked me to feed and look after my niece till afternoon, I missed it. I honestly did not know that the baby was in the house and assumed that nobody was home. My niece had been hungry and must have been crying for a very long time(though I did not hear anything), soiled herself and was rather miserable.

My sister kept yelling at me till she got into tears, calling me unreliable, useless, waste of space and some vulgarities etc, which might be true but I don't really care. I responded that she should also be ashamed of herself for leaving her baby to someone as unreliable as me without even bothering to confirm that I have received her message. She as the mother and primary caretaker, not me and if anything she is the one neglecting her child. My sister cried harder, left my room and hasn't talk to me since. 

For the peace of the family my parents have been urging me to apologize to my sister for being harsh on my words and pushing blame to her. I can apologize if that is what they wanted, but I doubt she would forgive me. I think I was just stating the truth though, AITA?


Edit for clarity 


I do have a job, study and pay (lower than market) rent and do chors too, just that I don't like human interaction in general so when not required to be social I prefer to be alone reading, listening to music, watching drama or gaming.


I don't remember hearing my niece crying that day. It could be me my headphones canceling out her sound or that when she wasn't crying anymore when I came out. It could also be me being completely oblivious, can't deny that possibility. 


There are hundreds of messages on my phone every day, from advertisement to group chats and personal messages. While I do get notifications I don't tend to check messages that frequently when I am not working, so my sister's message got lost in there. 


Yes I am apethetic, always had been but I can be social when needed and get along with my peers. No I am fine so I don't need ""professional help"", just like how being gay isn't a mental issue that needs to be corrected(no offense, just a comparison).

She makes comments about African Americans being ""ugly"" but the race she has the most prejudice towards is anyone who is Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc. She generalizes the way they speak and mocks them, she says they're all ugly, makes comments about how they ""shouldn't drive"" because they ""can't see"" properly, etc.

I've heard this all throughout my life from her and every time I've wanted to call her out but was afraid of what she'd say because all my life she's been a ticking time bomb and most of the time I'm too exhausted to deal with her constantly going on a rampage of saying cruel things and then playing the victim after it all.

This time in particular however, I was watching ""A Silent Voice"" beautiful anime movie by the way, it brought me to tears.  One of the scenes showing how Shouko speaks aloud was on while my mom was in the room, and of course as per routine she made a stupid comment basically stating that she's surprised anyone batted an eye at how she talks given that it's supposedly ""as unintelligible as any other Asian.""

I spoke up and said ""Oh shit, I forgot I can't watch what I enjoy without you trying too hard to make us laugh with an unfunny racist comment."" She said ""Excuse me?"" to which I replied that I was pretty sure she heard me, and then she asked me what it was like to have a ""fetish"" for Asian people (???) so I said ""What's it like to have such a bland personality that being a racist bitch is your main trait?""

She BLEW UP and told me I had no right to speak to her that way because she was my mother.  Basically I shrugged and I said that I'm treating her as I would any prejudiced person.  I was grounded for being ""disrespectful"" because apparently being racist is nothing but an opinion /s.

Pretty much the same hour I walked out of the house and announced that I was sleeping over at a friend's house because there's no way I was gonna serve a punishment for calling out a racist.  I'm getting mixed reactions.  Some say I was fully in the right and didn't need to change a thing, others say while I was in the right I should've just taken the punishment because I knew what the outcome would be.

In my office I have a vintage Marvel poster signed by Stan Lee and the artists of the poster.  The poster is over thirty years old.  Her son saw this and thought it was really neat and wanted me to give it to him.  I tried being diplomatic but let him know that wouldn't happen.  For certain reasons, my office door locks behind me and you need keys to open it. This is important.
Fast forward the next day.  We're going to the park and I can't find my keys.  We're looking around the house and I hear her daughter yell out ""oh no!"" And my sister and I go running.  Her son has opened my office and climbed on the desk to get the poster down.  In doing it he managed to tear it in half.
I'm furious.  This poster is not only irreplaceable, I got it signed with my now deceased grandfather.  It has a lot of sentimental value for me.  My sister completely blew this off.  Hell, she even started giggling when her daughter said ""oh no"" the second time because she thought it sounded cute.  
She didn't offer me anything, even an apology.  Her argument is that I should have had my keys on me because I should have somehow expected that her son would try to take it down from the wall.  
Dad and wife are firmly in my camp.  Dad recognized how important this was to me because it was only a few days before he suddenly passed away and was the last thing we did together.
My mom and sister are acting like it's no big deal.  Sister ghosted me when I texted her asking about compensating me for the poster.  I'm case anyone is wondering, when we moved into my house, we had the poster appraised at $3k due to the condition and rarity of this particular poster.  I was informed after Stan Lee's death, it went up but we didn't have it reappraised.  This particular one does go on eBay and unsigned fetch north of $2k.
When I served her, my mom called me up telling me it was no big deal and she said she found another poster on eBay and when I saw the link I realized it was completely different, and wasn't signed, or anything like that.  It wasn't even the same year.  Now sister is complaining to mom that I'm ""being mean"" for going after her and not taking her offer and instead making her pay for it.  She thinks I should just let this go because ""kids will be kids"" so aita here?

Edit: since this has been raised in a few comments, yes the poster was framed.  It was professionally mounted in a frame.  It was not tacked to a wall or anything like that.

Update:  Mom is now in my corner.  We hadn't really spoken about this much as I was pretty angry about things.  She didn't realize that it was this one particular poster and she knew how much it meant to me.  Right now she's trying to convince my sister of the seriousness of this.

Update 2:  Sister responded to the filling.  Her argument is basically ""it's really mean that he's coming after me for a poster, I offered to buy him another one but he said no so I shouldn't have to pay anything"" I've heard from dad that her husband is trying to convince her that this isn't going to go well for her and to come to a resolution.

Last year me and my husband had our last child and the pregnancy was extremely complicated and life-threatening to both the baby and myself. At one point there was a 30% chance of both of us being alive by the end of it. Due to this I also have is some complications that are going to impact me for the rest of my life. During this time my husband was terrible. He did not support me at all and would get quite angry whenever I wanted to talk about it. He brushed It Off, didn't help around the house with the other kids, and got to the point where he was emotionally abusive. About a month after my daughter was released from the NICU my loving and caring husband came back but I was destroyed and told him that I wanted to divorce. Obviously we started going to counselling and during this time we found out that he had Asperger's Syndrome and was just really good at masking. Afterwards our entire relationship made a lot more sense to me, we always knew he was socially awkward and he has a lot of quirks and all of our arguments can be traced back to symptoms of his autism.

Now, after months of him not wanting to tell anybody he finally got the courage to tell his parents about his diagnosis. Their response? ""Oh, we always knew that. you were diagnosed with autism at 2. But we didn't tell you  so that you can have a normal life."" I was Furious, like I said all of our arguments have always been because the symptoms of his autism. So much hurt and pain for both of us could have been avoided had we known. My husband could have learned better coping techniques as a child, and I could have learned better coping techniques earlier in our marriage. I was so mad at them that I screamed that their selfishness could have cost us our marriage and may still. My husband was pretty pissed too and we both hung up the phone.

Now I'm getting phone calls saying that I took it too far and that his Asperger's diagnosis shouldn't have any impact on our relationship if I actually loved him.",2020-11-24 21:48:51,590,10157,0.97,16,6,172,12,,10,10,3,4,,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both of our sons go to top tier colleges and have had good internships. They excelled academically in school and my younger son was valedictorian. My daughter on the other hand takes her grades a bit less seriously, pretty much all Bs with one or two As/Cs. 

One of my sons got a summer internship that pays $50/per hour in San Francisco over the summer and my daughter was saying how she wants to apply there too because the pay was insanely good. I told her where her grades are at right now are not good enough to get the opportunities her brothers were getting. That most average people don’t even make $50/hour  ten years into their careers. That she might have to take out lots of student loans to cover college because she might not get the academic based scholarships her brothers got. That her grades now will affect the colleges she will get into and therefore also impact her future career opportunities. 

My daughter started saying that I thought she wasn’t good enough and that I don’t believe in her, which is not true. I just wanted to give her some tough love and let her now that the rate at which she is going will not get her the same opportunities her brothers have. I think she is young enough to still make changes and get back on the right track, she’s a smart girl but just doesn’t take school seriously enough. However, her father says I was being too harsh. He’s white and I’m Asian so it could be just cultural differences between us, AITA?

Edit: I have asked her countless times if she needs any help with her homework and also offered to get her a tutor, but she always brushes it off and says her grades are fine

Edit: Since some people seem to be projecting in the comments, I’ll clarify that I will love/support my daughter regardless of her grades. But she has expressed many times that she wants to go to the same school as her brothers(less than a 5% acceptance rate) and that she wants prestigious internships too and to make good money. However, she’s refused to go to SAT prep classes like her brothers have had and brushes off all the times that I’ve said if she does want these opportunities, she has to bring her grades up.

I am a 27 year old woman and my wife is 33. We met when I was 25 and she was 31. So there is 6 year age difference, sort of. I’ll be 28 in December and she won’t be 34 for 9 more months after that. Neither of us feel this age gap is very significant. Despite really liking me, she was actually a little more wary than I was starting the relationship, not want to seem like she was a creep, haha! Not that it matters, but I was the one who initiated things and persued her at the start. 

My 27 yo cousin recently moved into the same city as us and has taken to showing up at our apartment whenever she feels like it, despite us nipping it in the bud and telling her multiple times we may be busy and that there is a pandemic. We put our foot down about two weeks ago and then she’s taken to FaceTiming. One thing she’s touched on before is our age difference. She seems to have it in her mind that because of the gap and that I am very feminine whereas my wife is a classic butch, that my wife is “controlling” or that she’s in charge (our cat is in charge) and I’m kinda like a ditzy whatever. I’ve gotten  so sick of it. Yesterday she called and she actually said “do you ever worry that what your wife did was actually kinda predatory?” which like what?!! I hung up the phone and texted her saying “I don’t want to talk to you anymore until you get these weird ideas and stereotypes out of your head and I certainly don’t want you here for thanksgiving.” She wasn’t even invited to our thanksgiving in the first place, but seemed to be hopeful that we would change our mind.

There was never an issue until my brother met his now wife Julie\* five years ago. 

Julie is very big into fad diets (Atkins, keto, South Beach) and every year she sends me a list of foods that she cannot eat and a list of things that she can. Last year I cooked her the exact keto foods that she wanted and she was upset the entire meal because my brother didn't want to eat it with her so they fought at the table. 

Last week she sent me a text message that she is now on the fertility diet as they are starting IVF and sent me another list of foods that she cannot eat and a planned menu for me to cook for her. 

I texted her back and told her that this year I was making one meal and one meal only and she could either eat what was being served or bring her own food. She texted back and told me that I was being selfish and didn't care about her. 

My brother called me up the next day and asked if I was happy about ruining Thanksgiving and started to yell about how at their BBQ last summer they catered to my food allergies (I am deathly allergic to strawberries and have an epi-pen). I told my brother that this was not the same as a life threatening food allergy, that this was  dietary choice, and it changes every year. 

He called my mother, who told him that we all find it difficult to keep up with Julie's dietary needs and that if she wants special foods, she needs to bring them herself.

Now my entire family is fighting with each other, my brother won't speak to me and my SIL is posting nasty things about me on Facebook.

I talked to my husband about this, and he said this was ""ridiculous high school bullshit drama."" He told me he would be fine canceling the whole meal and it just being our family. I agreed with him and sent everyone a text message. I told them that Thanksgiving at my house is canceled. That I am serving (Thanksgiving menu). If they want to come over and eat with us, they are welcome to do so.

My sister is thrilled that I finally said something about it. She hosts Christmas dinner and is also tired of cooking extra meals. My mom however is upset that we are all fighting and thinks that I shouldn't have canceled the meal.

I am very successful in my career in a very male-oriented field with all the expectations and stigma that entails. I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years. He's not interested in getting married, and at this point that's fine. Everyone assumes this was my dream and that I'm happy but it couldn't be further from the truth. I know there are women who live for this and want to be where I am, and I applaud them for it. It's just not me. I wanted to be a wife and mother and have a just okay job or even just skills so that I could support me and my kids if something happened. 

I was overjoyed to get married when I was 24 and the happiest day of my life was the birth of my son. He died of cancer just after he turned one and my husband died a year later, leaving me a widow just before my 27th birthday. I've never been close to my family for reasons that have varied over the years. I have friends, but they got their own families and lives. I had nothing, except for my career. I threw myself into work and found the ability to rise. Having a woman on their team looked good for PR, and a woman that didn't have any ""pesky women things"" was their ideal. 

I finally started dating my boyfriend and we aren't using protection, but I am well aware that the clock is at midnight. He is close to his family, especially his sister. My boyfriend's sister, who is SAHM of 5, has been really pushing for a mentor to her 2 daughters for years, and finally got her chance to push me into talking to them. I've never wanted to because I'm not proud or happy of where or who I am. 

So when I was finally pushed into speaking, I told them this. Yes, women can and should pursue whatever career they want, but my ""success"" isn't because I had a dream and worked hard, it's because my life was so empty and painful that I needed something else to think about. I didn't want to be the ""high powered career woman"", it's just what I had to do. Being a CEO (not my job title) means nothing to me. Their mother tried to steer the conversion by suggesting that I wouldn't give it all away now that I have it though, but I didn't let her and clarified that I would give it all away to have a family of my own. Honestly, if it would bring me my late husband and a healthy version of my son back, I would quit my job tomorrow and forget the last 15 years. 

Now his entire family is mad at me for ""enforcing gender roles"" and making it seem like being a SAHM (which every woman in his family besides me are) is the only way for a woman to be happy.

I left for college when I was 18 and my sister left for the same college the year after. We lived together the whole time. Neither of us really missed home because who misses feeling like a second thought? We only went home for the holidays. In the summers we did car trips and had a blast.

When I was 21 I met my now husband. The three of us (me, sis and him) became super close. After that he joined our summer trips. We got married two year later and had twins the following year. The kids are now 3. We stopped the trips after the twins were born but after their first birthday we decided to go on 3 weeks vacations annually. When they grow up we will make sure to adjust the trips so they can join us.

Right after my sister finished college I got a job near our hometown. My sister had no reason to stay where we were so she moved back with us. My husband's parents live close, just two hours away and my parents and my brother still live in our old house 15 minutes away. For the first two trips after the twins were born we left them with my MIL and FIL. They are amazing grandparents.

Well, this year it clicked to my parents that my girls were obviously not going with us on the trips. They asked who had watched the twins the first two times and I explained that my MIL and FIL had. They asked to keep them this year and I said no, but thanks for the offer, we appreciate it. They wanted to know why my MIL and FIL could have them for long periods of time but they couldn’t.

I was honest. Said that I do trust them to babysit for short periods as I know they would never neglect the girls in those few hours. But I don’t want they to have them for three weeks. They need a lot of attention. And so does my brother. And while I don’t think they would do anything on purpose I’m afraid they will end up too focused on my brother and temporarily forget the twins need their attention as well.

They accused me of hating my brother (I don’t) and said that I was a horrible sister. They said I was punishing them for caring for my brother and preventing them from bonding with my girls. My sister and husband agree with me, though. But I fear they are just too close to the situation to judge.

Our relationship was at that level and she needed help with rent since her hours were cut and she had been dipping in to her savings to get around, so it just made sense.

I ended up paying 60% of all shared costs we were gonna go 50/50 but since her hours were cut and I already made more then her before that happened so I figured it would allow her to replenish her savings.

It was pretty great for a few months until she out of the blue told me her mom was gonna come live with us as she had lost her job and house. I told her I was not comfortable with that and asked if there were alternatives. She said that she could live with her grandma(her moms mom) but that her mom felt it was humiliating so that was a no go, I still told her I was not Okay with this. Apparantly living with your adult daughter and her boyfriend is less humiliating?

Now it is worth noting that her mom is...well...weird. she is very obsessive, entitled, high maintenance, puts her nose were it doesn't belong and is a very dominant ""do it my way"" type of person. She once had a meltdown because my girlfriend baked a cake for her nephews birthday and so did her mom she did not know about this but my girlfriends cake was better and que meltdown. I got dozens of stories like this.

My protests were ignored and 4 weeks ago her mom moved in to the guest room, day 1 was already a shitshow, I was going on a grocery run and noticed my grocery list had a ton of extra shit on it, when I asked her mom said she added it. So I asked her for money and she said she had none and my girlfriend acted like I was a dick for asking. It turned in to an argument with my GF were she said its her name on the lease so her choice who lives there. Long story short I noticed in the store all of the stuff she added was brand stuff and costs way more, and when I got at the cash register I had to pay 220 bucks were I usually spend like 90 bucks at most for the two of us, I put it on my GF's card, cause fuck I aint paying for that.

When I got home I called a buddy, asked him if I could crash at his place for a bit a few weeks at most while I look for a new apartment, he asked his girlfriend and they called me back later giving me the okay and I moved out the next day, I am mpving in to a new place in a week. Obviously we were barely on speaking terms when I left.

Now that we started talking again she has been adamant I am in the wrong and the only reason I did what I did was because it was her mom and not someone else, had it been her dad I would have been fine with it and I can't deny that lol, her dad is great.

They live out of town and I haven’t met all of them before. It was us and four other people, all couples. My bf has known them since he was a teenager. They’re all 7-8 years older than me and all have nice full time jobs and went to private school.

If you got an entree at the place you could choose 2 sides. I got grilled chicken and Mac and cheese on the side. It wasn’t like a bowl of Kraft, it was on the adult menu and was made with truffle oil and jalapeños. I also got potato wedges and lemonade, I was the only one not drinking wine or anything.

My boyfriend said I embarrassed him by getting a “little kid” food. I know my tastes aren’t super upper crust but I don’t see the issue since it’s not like I ordered from the kiddie menu. I didn’t like any of the other sides so idk why I should suffer through eating asparagus and quinoa just to seem like an adult. He already teases me for not liking salads or sushi and stuff that much.

He says I’m not taking this seriously enough And I’m immature. he wanted me to make a good impression on his friends but I need to develop some better tastes before we do anything remotely fancy again.

I know I’m more of a “burger and fries” girl than “Wagyu and whatever rich people eat.” I didn’t mean to embarrass him I just don’t know what the protocol is, I didn’t start eating at nice restaurants until after we started dating.

Wow I come back to over 500 notifications lol. And since a lot of you are concerned about it I do eat vegetables I just don’t like lettuce or asparagus and some other stuff lol. I’m not living off of McD’s, I don’t even eat fast food.

I’m also tired of getting comments from people who haven’t been dirt poor telling me how wrong I am about “rich people food”. Like, sorry to break it to you, but fresh quinoa and kale and sushi is a privilege to a lot of people.

And I’m 22, there’s like 100 comments just asking me that, please let it end. I just don’t like alcohol, I’m not underage.

I'm a pretty positive person and I know I'm very patient but that has a limit. We have a son (18months), me and husband both work from home. 


Today he was bemoaning the fact that there was nothing for lunch in the house, but he didn't just moan, he started going on and on about how he was starving while I was trying to settle our son for his nap, I was trying my hardest to be patient, I even told him to wait for me to settle son then I'd pop to the shop and grab something, but no, despite the fact that I was clearly getting stressed because son was being difficult and was overtired so was screaming and crying and didn't want to be touched but wanted to be touched. Instead of offering to settle son himself he just continued to stand there whining about being hungry. Eventually I snapped, I lost my cool and yelled ""will you just effing stop"" and left him with son while I stormed outside with a cig to have just 5 minutes alone.


He came outside and told me I owed him an apology which I admitted I do but I also explained that I've told him several times now that his nonstop whining was effecting me mentally especially when it's me who does the food shopping, cleaning, getting up and dealing with son all day everyday while trying to stay positive, work and not go full Hulk and smash everything in a 6mile radius. I reminded him that I've told him so many times that his constant moaning is like a pickaxe to my mental health and every day it's chipping away at it and I can't take it anymore, I'm at the point where I'm one whine away from a breakdown. 



Anyway I later got a call from his mum, nan and sister who told me I was out of order for yelling at him and then lecturing him after apologising as that negated the apology. It's made me doubt myself.



AITA for telling him to just stop whining when I'm the one who deals with everything?




Edit to clarify some info - he was a alcoholic and when I ask him if he can go to the shop or store he says he can't go alone because he'll probably drink.


We were both raised very traditionally where men work and women stay home and do everything else. 




I am aware I'm a doormat and over the years I've gotten better but I guess not as much as I thought as I've let him and his family wipe their feet all over me. I appreciate every response even if I haven't responded to them all. I'm going to have a soul search and decide if I believe in him enough that he'll change his ways or if I leave (however scary that is).

I have a 17 year old brother, a 15 year old sister, and a 13 year old brother. So ... Yeah I was already sick of babies and babysitting and all that comes with that. Then this year my parents got pregnant, and had a baby girl. 

She's 3 months old now, and I'd been going a little crazy in the house already because it's noisy being around all my younger siblings. Now with a crying baby too, sleep and school have been difficult.

I started wearing foam earplugs to bed, the kind construction workers wear to protect their hearing, then I bought a pair of noise cancelling headphones for myself and started wearing them over top of the foam earplugs to bed. With a couple pillows piled over my ears. And I've been sleeping a lot better. 

I've also started wearing the earplug / headphones combination when I'm in classes or studying. I can hear the teachers through the headphones despite the earplugs and I am not distracted at all.

I've also been wearing them when I am doing things like reading books or video calling my friends. 

And my parents and siblings have started to get upset with me, saying that I've been completely closed off from the family, I can't hear anything like my parents calling my name. They don't like how I can't hear the baby to help out sometimes, my parents like all the siblings to help each other out and help with the baby when we can, and say it's dangerous for me to be blocking out her crying because what if I'm the only one who could have caught something bad happening if only I was aware of my surroundings

They've also been upset with me because I've locked my door when I sleep or study and a few times they've wanted something from me and couldn't get my attention. Like one time some of their family friends came over and they wanted all the family to come have brunch with this family. Which I didn't really feel comfortable with visits anyway but they were embarrassed that they couldn't wake me.

This year was a little different, they aren’t doing normal seating, you can only reserve private party rooms. Since she had to rent a whole room, she said why don’t we include everyone(daughter was fine with that) since there is more than enough space. 


My youngest 2 are 5 and 3. They have never been to a fancy tea room or anywhere that fancy honestly. The private room was small, just enough space for the table and chairs really. 


my younger kids were getting rambunctious so I decided to take them outside whenever I felt like they were getting a little too energetic. I never let it get to the point that they disrupted tea. We went outside, got some wiggles out, then I reminded them that inside we behave appropriately and calmly, stay seated, inside voices, use manners, etc 



The third time I decided to take them out my mom stopped me and said “last time”. I didn’t know what she was talking about so I just kept going. She came outside and reiterated that this was the last “wiggle break” the kids would be getting as it’s inappropriate to keep leaving the table like that. 


I pushed back that this was their first formal etiquette experience and while they are learning, they need time to get their energy out and be their best when back inside. No one is worried about what we are doing, just leave us be and go back and enjoy the tea with my oldest. 


My mom just said that she’ll take note to never do a family tea since it’s clearly too much for us to handle.


I talked to my sister and she sees both sides. She thinks I should’ve just said ok when our mom decided no more outside breaks since it was her tea brunch that she planned and was paying for. On the other hand, she thinks it’s petty of our mom to make that demand to begin with because it wasn’t hurting anyone",2020-11-23 16:30:55,680,7257,0.97,18,14,222,7,,2,,2,1,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About a year ago they hired Tabitha\* to work in their accounting department. Since the day she first started working there, she has had an infatuation with my husband that is now becoming unprofessional and inappropriate.

This started when the heat went out in her office. My husband's job as supervisor is to assign tasks to his employees, however, she is never satisfied with the work they do, even though he says that they do great work, so she demands he work on her office. She constantly calls him on his work phone for mundane things (carpet is loose in a corner, loose screw on her coat hook) and he goes and fixes them without issue. 

Last year when we went to the company Christmas party (pre-plague times) she was very flirty with him, constantly grabbed his hand. When he introduced us she just grinned at my and said ""look there's Peter,"" and grabbed his hand and walked away. When we sat at the table she damn near pushed me out of my seat to sit next to him, and my husband told her to get up that it was my seat. She walked off in a huff, and when she saw me in the restroom she shoved past me. I told my husband what happened and he said it was fine, that she was harmless. I told him that she was not fine, and that she clearly had feelings for him and she was acting like a jealous girlfriend. 

The past few weeks this has ramped up to an astonishing level of inappropriate. She recently moved into a new house and my husband and some of the other guys from work helped her move and put things together. He gave her his personal cell phone number, and she has been calling and texting non-stop about things she needs help with. Multiple times a day at all hours of the day and night she will call and text him for help. Last night at 2:00AM she called about her heat not working right. My husband said he would go over and look at it after work. I broke down. I told him he was not going, that she could call a technician like everyone else, and that he is not her personal maintenance man. 

I told him very clearly that she has feelings for him and he is so dense he can't see it. I told him that while it is nice to help on occasion, she calls him all the time asking for help with things that she can do on her own (move boxes/furniture) or pay to have a repair person come and fix. I told him that once he gave out his personal phone number that he crossed a line, and I am not comfortable with it. 

He said that this will most likely be an easy fix and it won't take long, so I cried and told him that he can either to be married to me, or married to her, but I wasn't going to be the third wheel in my own marriage. 

He says he does not have feelings for her and that I am overreacting to him just wanting to help a friend. I feel otherwise.

I signed a very extensive and strict NDA. Anyone directly involved in my life, mom, dad, sis, and husband, also signed an NDA. The nanny family recommended this, to talk about the job without getting into any legal trouble or putting them at risk.

Recently ran into one of my parents' neighbors, Amber, at the park. Amber asked how the new job was going, then proceeded to ask specifics about how it must be working for a family where the parents are (insert their jobs here). A direct violation of the NDA and something I could be fired and sued for.

My dad isn't the sharing type, like at all, so I figured it was probably my mom. I asked her about it in a casual “Hey how’s Amber,” way. I said I ran into Amber at the park and that it was odd because she knew details about my job without me telling her. My mom simply shrugged and said, ""That's funny. Maybe she googled? Or saw something on social media?""

My dad and sister absolutely hate Amber. They essentially said hell would have to freeze over before they spoke to her willingly. My dad ended our convo where I asked him about it by saying, ""The only thing I know about her is that her son just made partner at a law firm in New York and is making bank and that's only because mom saw it on instagram and told me about it.""

Right then, I knew my mom lied to me and it was her. She and Amber love to ""one up"" each other with their children's success, and I also just landed a great new job. I asked my mom about it AGAIN and she told me that I was being dramatic, making stuff up, and that she would never do that to me.

My mom doesn't text people, only DM's on instagram. I know her password so logged in to check her messages. There was an extremely long DM to Amber where she shared their professions, children's names, ages, private school, general locations of their homes, how they pay ""really well"", etc. Everything that we are legally NOT allowed to say, she said.

I called her immediately and said that I logged into her DM's and saw the message she sent Amber that was a violation. She started screaming at me about how she is supposed to be able to trust her daughter, she can't believe I hacked into her instagram, that mothers should be allowed to brag about their children, and then she hung up.

It has been a week without contact between the two of us. We used to speak every single day. I am starting to believe that maybe I'm the asshole here for violating her trust like that. My husband says if anyone violated trust here it is her and that I gave her ample opportunity to tell the truth before I intervened and sought out the truth myself. He constantly reminds me that they could sue us into the ground, and fire me, for endangering my nanny family's well being. Because truthfully, Amber could easily be a psycho fan or sell the information to someone who is.

He went to college while I stayed and worked at an office job. We continued to date throughout the whole thing and got married when he graduated from college. It took a while but with our combined incomes we can live a decent life. (middle class) I had two other children with him.

All of the kids are adults now and two are in college while the other graduated. Each kid had a college fund of about 50 thousand. Well, my father died due to the pandemic and in the will, I got a lot of money and property. If I sold the properties I would have enough to retire right now. I talked to my husband about it and we decided to sell the properties. With the combined money we were going to put 3/4 into our retirement fund, and use the rest to explore the world and fun money. I have never left the USA before and it has been a dream to see the world for such a long time. We are making plans to keep working until 2023 and then go explore the world for a whole year.

We told our kids the plan and they were upset that we weren't using the money to pay for their college /debt Every kid has debt since the 50 thousand didn't cover everything so they had to take out loans. It turned into an argument and  I put my foot down and said no and that I am finally going to do what I want. That I sacrificed enough and that I'm not giving up this dream again.

Edit (answer some questions) The kids are 26, 22, 21 and I'm 44.

I have 5 younger brothers and 3 sisters. My sister is 20 and my brother is 19. Youngest is 4 yrs old and my other siblings ages range from 16yrs-7yrs. 

My parents would’ve had way more kids but my mom suffered from several miscarriages.

Pretty much since I was 6 I had to take care of all my siblings. I could never go out because my parents were working and nobody to take care of my siblings. I love my siblings but I hated never having freedom.

It used to annoy me like crazy that they would just pop one kid after another. Our house wasn’t that big so everyone shared rooms, never had any private space, parents made good money but because of so many kids they struggled financially.  

Yrs later I found out the reason why they had so many kids because they weren’t using any protection AT ALL. My mom said they didn’t believe in using protection and any kids they had were because of “gods will.” 

If they didn’t get pregnant, that was fine, if they did it was because that was God’s plan. I was so mad since I was the one also stuck taking care of all these kids because they’re too stubborn to use protection since it’s against their beliefs.

When my mom got pregnant again with my youngest sibling, I waited til my 18th and moved out that day. Made sure I moved far too (1 hr away) so I had that excuse. When my sis turned 18 she begged me to let her live with me and I said ya. My bro did too eventually. My sister has already moved out but he’s still there with me while we continue our college classes. 

They saw that I limited contact with my parents to avoid getting stuck babysitting so they wanted out too. Now my younger bro who’s 16 is spending more time at my place because he hates it at home.

My parents are mad at me for dipping out on them since that’s made my other siblings not wanna be responsible for the younger ones either. My dad told me they’re hurt I turned my back on my family and have made my siblings do the same.

Cause I’m the older one so I have the most influence on them and ever since I left they followed with the same attitude. A part of me does feel bad that they’re having a hard time but at the same time I feel they brought that on themselves just thinking they can have however many kids and expecting us all to just live with their actions.

My dad remarried when I was 11. He fell in love hard and fast with his wife and they got married six months later. She had three kids ages 6, 7 and 9 at the time. It was a lot for me. Everything is so much...more. Things are louder and busier and there are so many more people and I was never excited like they were but I never wanted to say anything so I kept my mouth shut and let things happen for my dad, who was so happy. On the inside I was hurt though. I was hurt that my dad seemed to be so eager to leave everything behind when he got remarried. We no longer did pizza after school on Friday, we no longer watched something together on Sundays before bed. Everything had to including everyone and when I would ask to do something just with my dad he would say no and look confused. One time my dad asked why I was so eager to do stuff with him but never cared about family time and I said because I missed him. He said I never lost him.

Then back in October last year they put us all into family therapy because for one of my classes we had to design something in computer class, I was given a family tree, did the family tree of my dad, mom and me and then grandparents, etc. My teacher showed my dad at at the PT conference because of how good it was and he and his wife freaked out about the steps not being included and so family therapy happened. First therapist was a dud, second one didn't make anyone feel comfortable and then when we were supposed to start with the current therapist Covid hit and we couldn't do them from home so we started in July or August, can't remember when exactly now. Then she was good and so I opened up. But I don't think they handled it well.

Four sessions in I was asked why I was distant. I admitted I found it hard. I felt like everyone else was so happy and I didn't want to rock the boat but it was too much for me and I missed when it was just me and my dad, because that's when it was most comfortable for me. She asked what I missed about it. I said it was the time I got with my dad, the fact it always felt like home, and it has felt less like home since more people joined the family, and I have felt bad about it but it was a lot going from three, to two for so many years and then we went up to 6 overnight and it was all so fast and they were so eager and started calling me their sister and daughter right away but I didn't feel that way and then my dad stopped doing our stuff together and I felt like I lost him.

My dad said he was hurt I wasn't happier for him and that I didn't give it more of a chance before rejecting them. My stepmom was hurt that after 5 years I hadn't warmed up to her and her kids enough to feel like they were part of my home. The therapist said how I felt was valid and asked why they felt like what I said was bad. And we have been going around in circles since.

AITA? I feel like I should have stayed quiet because now they're just mad at me.

Edited: I tried talking to my dad yesterday and it did not happen. He told me he needed space. So they're still pissed.

I also want to address that I never said I needed to keep my dad all to myself. I wanted him to be happy. But I wanted him to want to spend time with just me too. It didn't have to be all the time. But twice a week or even once a week alternating our old traditions would have been good, or even bi weekly. But there was nothing and when I asked I was told no. He's my dad. He's the only parent I have left and it feels like I was abandoned by him. Having more people around didn't make up for that. They could never make up for what I had with my dad. But our relationship is gone. It didn't have to stay the very same but it's just gone.",2020-11-22 09:01:52,687,8036,0.97,0,5,243,0,3,,4,8,14,,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mine (M23) and my fiancee's (F22) wedding is this month. Wedding planning has been literally a nightmare. Her mom keeps stomping boundaries and changes any plans we come up with to have a ""decent"" wedding and not let me ""ruin"" it and embarrass her.

Her mom thinks I'm a kid she calls me ""son"" and it's so annoying and inappropriate. My fiancee is the youngest in the family and I'm the youngest son in law in the family that's why I got this nickname.

Anyways. My fiancee and I already discussed and decided to have my 9 year old sister be the flower girl. She has mild cerebral palsy but she's functioning and does good at school. She's had people make comments about her and she's very sensitive so she'd get upset because of these inconsiderate people's comments.

My sister's is on cloud nine ever since she was told she will be the flower girl. She got her dress and so far she's tried it on more than 5 times asking me when I'm going to have the wedding which is sweet. Thing is My fiancee came to tell me last week that we will be making changes in terms of menu/invitation cards because her mom recommended other things instead of what we agreed on. According to her mom I have no idea what a ""good decent wedding"" look like and wanted to save us (herself) from ""embarrassment"".

I let it go. And didn't say anything. Because my fiancee told me these are small issues and that I needed to go with the flow. Okay no problem but to suggest that we picked the ""wrong"" girl to be the flower girl was the straw that broke the camel's back. She actually said she wasn't sure how my sister will behave at the wedding and that we shouldn't take chance and just pick her niece instead.

I told her no not gonna happen. Like I gave my parents and my sister my word. no way I'm going to make her upset and sad and let the niece take her place. My fiancee threw a fit and said I was overreacting. That my sister still gets to wear her dress but sit with the crowd instead of walking down the aisle. We been arguing over this the whole week and I'm now supposed to call her and say okay but I refused and I'm standing my ground and wanting my sister to be the flower girl despite what others say because this offends me and my family.

EDIT: People say that we can have more than one flower girl but my mother in law doesn't think my sister should even be included as one. She wants her sitting like a guest the whole time thinking she might ""misbehave"" where in fact my sister isn't like that at all. She's well-behaved and smart even better than other kids. My fiancee seems to agree since she wants me to say yes.",2020-11-01 22:07:40,1971,18965,0.97,2,0,152,0,,5,11,5,10,,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,7,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,

Within this year she has taken a cultural competence class which has opened her eyes to the many injustices of the world the she feels very strongly about. 

The issue with this is she has taken to heart the “white silence is white violence” that has been taught in this course and within the last few months has been verbally attacking family to the point that no one wants to have holidays with her. 

This reached a breaking point for me when she corrected another family member (who is on the autism spectrum and doesn’t always understand inappropriate) for making a joke when the dinner rolls got burnt and he said “the rolls are biracial”. She snapped at him that “that is NOT culturally appropriate”, causing him to physically sag, and then she attempted to walk away. I told her no, she wasn’t going to do that and as an adult, if she were going to correct another adult or ANYONE in general she was going to explain why. She got pissed and told me it wasn’t her job to explain why but now he would know to not say things like that. I disagreed telling her it was lazy and disrespectful to take the time to punish a behavior but not offer an explanation as to why. She told me I was being a trouble starting bitch and stormed out. 

So, AITA?


Edit: I automatically assumed that everyone would have known that OF COURSE after my family member stormed out, it was explained to my cousin why this happened.

I F31 lost my late husband in 2016. He got sick with cancer during the first year of our marriage. It was absolutely terrible and devastating. I don't want to go into much details because it really hurts to remember those difficult times. My late husband suffered a lot and he didn't ask for much. He just wanted to be able to sleep but he couldn't. I remember when he used to tell me this and it broke me. I did all i could to ease his pain but I don't think it was enough at all. He was taken from me eventually despite everything. I have a good relationship with my former in laws and I'm grateful for the support they showed me. I wouldn't have been able to carry on without them.

I been married to my husband for 4 months now. He's a good man. We have our fair share of arguments just like any other couple. He's divorced so this isn't his first serious relationship.

Once he moved in with me he said he wanted to replace all the furniture even though it was in good condition. He insisted and even though I didn't agree I did it eventually because he'd get into an argument with me and turn his phone off for a few days. Next He suggested that I donate some of my late husband's belongings saying that I kept too many. This was hard for me to do but I was able to sort through his belongings and kept a few things. 

Last month we were talking and he expressed being uncomfortable living at my house. He told me that every time he'd come home feels like coming to someone else's home instead of his. He said that he can't enjoy sitting in the backyard without picturing my late husband there. He said he felt awful about it but couldn't help it. He refused to go to therapy thinking this was just ""ridiculous"". At this point it was clear he was making excuses to get me to move out of the house since he suggested this before we got married.

He knew how I felt about selling the house but still brought it up. He then told me about a job opportunity that he didn't want to miss and asked if I was willing to support him by agreeing to sell the house and move out of town. This was sudden so I asked for some time to think about it but I was surprised to find the house was already put on the market for sale. Even pictures were taken. I was furious. I had a huge argument with him. He said he thought I agreed but he knew I wanted time to think but just decided to do what he wanted. He lashed out at me when I asked if this job opportunity really exists and he said I was being selfish and inconsiderate. Then left and turned his phone off.

I have no idea how to deal with this issue especially since he says that I'm not being supportive and constantly making him feel pressured.",2020-11-24 22:08:57,847,3425,0.96,0,0,249,1,,,1,,4,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I started at my job about 8 months, which requires me to go to two different sites. (Site A and site B). For the first several months, I was part time due to an injury, and even after that was sorted I still spent the majority of my time at site A. The last couple of months I started working more and more at site B, so I got to know the staff better. Because of that I've started having lunch with several of them. 

This is where the issues have started cropping up, for some reason they can't stop commenting on how I look or what I eat. For context, I am a recreational bodybuilder, so I eat and look a bit differently than other people. I've had several people look at me with clear disgust in their face and say ""do you *always* eat so healthy?"" when I pull out my lunch. (Should be noted I NEVER comment on their food, unless its to say it looks nice). Several also call my food ""dog food"" and say that it's gross. Another time a colleague mentioned starting to go to the gym, and I offered to train with him, when another interjected that he would go to the gym if he wanted to be ""on some sort of vain and narcissistic trip"". This is between the classical bits of making fun of how wide my shoulders are, and accusing me of using steroids (in a very hurr de durr meathead, kind of way). 

It eventually became too much when we were having lunch two weeks ago, I pulled out some chicken and a bit of fruit. Which again prompted the ""do you always eat so healthy"" remark, this then morphed into talking about how one girl vastly prefers chubby guys, and thinks that my forearms are gross due to my visible veins. Which then caused another girl to say that she ""likes guys with a bit of muscle, but that's too much"". So I snapped and said ""you say that like I actually give a fuck if you find me attractive or not, oh sorry, could you lay out exactly what you find attractive in men so I can rearrange my entire life in the hope that you will find me attractive?"" 

Since then, whenever I get a stupid comment, I say the same thing back reversed, they ask if I always eat healthy, I ask if they always eat unhealthy junk food. If they make fun of my wide shoulders or say ""SteRoiDs"" I reply ""well, not everyone wants to look like an unbaked loaf of bread"".

This has caused some to go to their boss, accusing me of being rude, mean, and a bully. While others are not hugely bothered/understand where I am coming from. 

I've got a sit down with their boss next week, but wanted to know what Reddit thinks, AITA?",2020-11-25 15:50:00,504,8450,0.96,3,0,221,54,,3,4,1,4,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was an identical twin and me and my sister were born early and she died a few hours after we were born. Every single birthday since I was little has also been a birthday for her. We go to her grave and put flowers on it and every gift has always had both her and my name on it.

Mom gets really sad and always cries for a long time and I have always felt overshadowed on my birthday. The grave visit and flowers and all have always been mandatory and I was never allowed to have friends over or have a party until after we did it. I want to go to dinner with my boyfriend for my birthday at his house and then I’m gonna watch movies with my friends.

Mom is upset I’m not making the hour long drive Friday to do the grave ritual and is really sad and my dad is making me feel guilty since I’m their only living daughter and stuff. I told my mom I don’t wanna share my birthday with a sister I never even knew and I’m done with sharing with a ghost since this has been my entire life.

My parents are really upset and now I feel rly bad and maybe I should suck it up but I am just so sick of it.

Edit
Ok so I didn't expect his much attention so I'll try to answer some questions I've gotten a lot of. 

First of all I don't live at home I live on campus which is an hour away from my hometown. Second, idc if my parents go, they can do whatever they want, just w/o me. I've hated going to the cemetery since I was like 13 and realized how weird it was but my parents were very ""my house my rules"" about going. I don't like standing over the grave of a dead baby just to pretend to feel sadder than I do.I know its hard on my parents but I just wanna have a bday w/o being guilted by them. My mom gets quiet and cries a little whenever my sister is brought up and its turned up to 100 on my bday (she died the same day we were born). It sucks seeing her like that. I love my parents but you can love someone and not like their choices too.

Also I have abt 10 unopened messages rn. I won't be reading them. Two of the ones I got earlier were really mean and one said I should have died instead so fuck off. Not reading anymore DMs don't waste your time. If you're afraid I won't see your opinion in the comments try getting over it.",2020-10-28 15:05:13,2031,29474,0.96,0,12,160,0,,10,13,14,16,,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,5,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,

We had this very small church wedding with just family and friends. My friend,David, is a professional photographer and is kinda famous in our city for his amazing work. When I told him about my wedding, he offered to do the photos for free as a wedding gift. 

Yesterday we received the wedding pics, and well, he’s edited the heck out of my face and body. First thing I noticed was that he’s made my waist smaller to get that ‘hourglass’ appearance. The next thing he did was to edit my rather pointy nose into a small, button-like one. In some pictures, where my side profile is visible, he’s edited out the dorsal hump. The end result still looks like me, but also like every generic Instagram model you see online. I quite like my nose, and I quite liked the way I looked on my wedding day. 

So I called him up to ask if he had the unedited versions of these pics and he said he’s already deleted those. I told him that he shouldn’t have photoshopped my wedding pics without asking first and that it ruined the whole thing. He said that he only made subtle changes, changes that most of his clients ASK him to do and that’s why he was being proactive in my case. I told him that it was very stupid to assume that everyone likes/wants the same thing. He didn’t think he was wrong and said that he was trying to do a nice thing and I was being ungrateful. 

I told all of this to a common friend, and she thinks I’m overreacting because all he did was, quote, ‘make you look prettier.’

The land was originally acquired to be developed into a subdivision but my grandfather like the land so he kept it for his family. While entered to become a land where all his kids and their kids would build homesteads on, when he died none of my moms siblings really wanted it, so my mom was sold or just given their shares. 

I’m living on my own but came to visit my mom because  both my mom and I are people who have not been around people and that wasn’t the care with my siblings or other relatives. 

There are tons of trails on the property and I went to go walk with my dog and my moms dog (both off leash). My mom had told me that she has occasionally thought she heard Motor bikes but she had never seen them so she didn’t know if were on our property and since she hasn’t seen them didn’t have anything to call police about. 

While On one of the trails a motor bike zoomed passed me, almost hitting my dog. I yelled at them but they didn’t stop. After walking some more I heard what sounded like the guy coming back so I got out my phone ready to take a picture of him. When eh drove passed he realised this, slowed down and ask what I was doing. I told him I was taking a picture to show the police who I was just about to call. He quickly sped off. 

I did call the police and they said they wouldn’t be there for about 45 minutes  to do an offical report which was okay because it would take me while to walk back to the main house. 

BTW any and all entrances to the property have clear signs that say it is private property not to tress pass About fifteen minutes later I was in a part of the trail that parallels a road and was near one of the back entrances we have. A Truck was sitting at the entrance. It had a different dirt bike in the back of it. I couldn’t tell if someone was in the truck but I knew the Truck didn’t belong to anyone that was supposed to be there so I took a picture of the back license plate. A guy rolled down the window and asked if I was the same guy “who said something to his buddy” I said yes and that the police were already in their way because this was Private property and they were trespassing. The guy gave me the finger and drove off. 

When the police came the I explained that whole this was the first time seeing them, this wasn’t the first time my mom thinks they have been on our lane officer basically told me I was wasting his time reporting such a minor thing, especially since it was thanksgiving. He said that I should let people have their fun. I reminded him that this was private property and these people were trespassing. He shrugged and said “well where do you expect people to ride their bikes around here when subdivisions are taking up all the land”

To give context, I(28m) have a speech impediment and for my whole life, almost every single person I have known has made fun of and ridiculed me for it. And generally, I love talking and having discussions with people,  but whenever someone laughs at me I just die a little inside. In addition, my wife(27f, currently 6 months pregnant with twins, together for 13 years) is the only person I know who doesn't make fun of/ridicule me for it. But over the past months, my wife has the need to either laugh or make a joke about the way I talk, I have tried telling her how it makes me feel, but she does it anyway. Well, yesterday when we were having dinner(don't celebrate Thanksgiving) and she spends a good twenty minutes just making fun of me, I was trying to keep come but I couldn't take it, I got up and told her to go fuck herself, and just had dinner in the guest room. After about five minutes I went out to get some water, and I saw her crying at the table, I was of course to angry to care at the time and just went back in the room. After about an hour my wife came in the room teary-eyed and apologized, but asked if I could also apologize, since I was still pretty pissed I told her to fuck off, which came with more tears. Well, today I started to wonder if I was in the wrong or not, I just couldn't take the jokes anymore and just snapped.

I need an outside perspective, AITA Reddit?

\*EDIT\* to clarify, during the pregnancy, making fun of me wasn't the only change, in general, she has gotten a lot more angry, bitter, EXTREMLY emotional, anti-social, and resentful. I originally thought it could be the pandemic, but she was never very social, to begin with, so it didn't change much for her.

\*Update\* My wife after crying all morning tried apologizing again today, I accepted it but told her I dislike the way she has been treating me, won't be accepting that type of treatment anymore, and if there is anything wrong with her I should know. This of course came with more tears from here, and I can tell you guys it is going to be a long next two months for me.",2020-11-28 03:01:21,605,4037,0.96,4,4,221,18,,1,,1,2,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was an awful time for us and I miss him terribly. My mum died when I was 15 and when she died her life insurance / death in service benefit paid out and it paid off the rest of the mortgage  on the house.
Due to my dad being (at that time) an aggressive alcoholic I moved out when I was 16. We still maintained a rocky relationship and the later years were much better and we were VERY close. I loved him so much despite the bad stuff. 

A couple of years later he met his gf. Eventually they got married around 2015. I never totally got on with her (nothing in common and hard to relate with) but my dad was happy and we had a polite relationship as I wanted my dad to have a companion. I’ve never considered her a “step mum”. 

Anyway, after he died I found out that his Will had been changed 2 weeks before he passed (whilst he had a large brain tumour) without my knowledge (I am one of the executors so was quite surprised I wasn’t told) which meant the sale of my parents home would go from being split 3 ways to her getting half and my brother and I the other half to split. We were not happy with how this went down but we have accepted the change to the will and moved on. 

she has now decided she wants to sell because she wants to move. She mentioned she wanted to get some work done on the house to increase the sale price and I emailed her saying not to spend much as it wasn’t worth it and it was unnecessary. She invited me over a few weeks ago to see the work and to give me some documents. When I got home I looked at the document she wanted me to sign agreeing to deduct nearly £16,000 from the sale of the house to pay herself back for the work. (Some of it was done ages ago and clearly for her living comfort and other paperwork only gave quotes for work not actual receipts or invoices)

The terms of the will are that she could live there until her death but she is responsible for the upkeep and maintenance as well as bills. She has lived there for 14 years rent free with my dad and 3 years without him 
  
My friends, family and I think is an absolute piss take to ask us for this money considering it is our family home which not only did both of our parents have to die for her to get but is our only inheritance from our parents.  

She is now pressuring me to agree to this and I am not happy I am being bullied by her to sign. She wrote the document, not a solicitor and no solicitor has been involved from her end about this. 

She has now told me she will withdraw the property from the market if I don’t agree. Which honestly (even though I am struggling financially and need to pay off debt) I don’t care about because if she lived there until she died then the house will just go to me and my brother and her (adult) kids won’t benefit from my parents.

So AITA for protecting what’s left of mine and my brother inheritance?

The other weekend my boyfriend and I hosted our families for the first time since we moved in together. This included my boyfriends parents, grandparents (moms parents he grew up with) and his brother, my parents and younger brother and sister. My sister is 18. When she was 7 she got really sick and afterward my parents refused to acknowledge any bad behavior and this sent her out of control. She is demanding, spoiled and selfish and has never apologized for anything she did in her entire life since that day. It always drove me crazy. My brother gets annoyed sometimes but they were closer in age and had more fun with it. I was the grumpy older sister who had to deal with her shit more.

So the other weekend they were all here and she was going through our stuff. My boyfriend asked her to stop and she didn't. I made her stop and she was bitching about it. Then she started asking really intrusive questions to my boyfriends parents about why they let his grandparents live with them. Right before dinner she said she wanted pizza, not whatever crap I had made. My boyfriend told her we weren't ordering pizza just for her and she said she didn't want to eat my shit. I was so tired of her disrespect that I told her to get out of my house. She was shocked I kicked her out and thought I was joking but I told her she was not welcome in my home if she was going to disrespect me like that.

My parents are pissed I would kick her out in front of other company. I told her I was tired of the disrespect and she was acting like a child. They said I shouldn't have been bullying her. My sister is pissed that I would kick her out before she could eat but she made it clear she wasn't going to eat what I prepared and we were not willing to pay for her to get takeout.

We are not particularly well off but managed to scrape together almost $30k for each of our children by the time they were mid teens. 

When our daughter(24) was 17/18 she became involved in a very cliquey group of wealthy girls who were constantly showing off to each other. Long story short but in an effort to impress these girls our daughter committed identity fraud against me in order to open several credit cards and buy a car. She had no job and no way of paying the almost 45k of debt she incurred. 

My husband and I declined to press charges against her but we wound up with 45k of debt that we couldn't afford to pay off, she we ended up having to use the money set aside for our children's futures. We made it clear to our daughter at the time that she would no longer have that nest egg and that she would have to pay us back for the 15k taken from her brothers future nest egg. She got a job at a fast food place, went to therapy, did everything we asked and turned into a respectable adult. 

She never went to university but has worked her way up to being FOH manager for a small restaurant and we are proud she has turned her life around. 

Our son turned 18 in January. He was supposed to go away to university in England this year but ended up taking a gap year instead because of covid. As promised we gave him the 30k and he has put most of it into a fund for university and future traveling and spent the remaining 4k on a car so he could get to his job(he works at a plumbing store). 

Our daughter came home for the first time since before covid to tell us she was getting married to her bf of 3 years. We were super excited and thrilled to see her. However when she saw her brothers car in the driveway she asked how he bought it and my husband reminded her of the fund. Long story short she is now upset that we have given her brother 30k despite being reminded about what she did and how much it cost us. 

She is now demanding that if we want to be invited to her wedding then we have to give her an amount equal to her brother. Honestly we are heartbroken. We simply cannot afford to give her that kind of money even if we wanted to and we thought she understood our position.

I've already taken it before and gotten a 1500. My sister got a 1100. Our parents, to motivate us gave a deal that would be put in motion if we both accepted. If we got 50+ points, then they will give us money based on our increase, if we don't reach our goal, then we'll get more chores. I find this horrendously unfair and I didn't accept it.

 

My thinking is that it's much harder to get a 1500 to a 1550 than a 1100-1150. You'll obviously get some sort of logistic growth in terms of effort. I didn't accept the deal because I honestly think it's unfair and I probably will not get significantly higher than last time. Scores this high will taper out and there is that random chance factor.

 

My step-sister is honestly pissed at me. She says she's been studying for a long time, and that she has really worked hard for the test. I honestly don't care. I shouldn't be punished for having a higher score. Once again, it's much harder to improve a higher score than a lower one.

Self-stimulating, also called stimming, is something autistic people do to calm themselves down, comfort themselves, and also just because it feels nice, ect. It can involve physical stimulations (Like snapping your fingers, bouncing up and down, rocking back and forth, fidgeting, fiddling with things, ect.) or vocal stimulations. (Like humming, groaning, moaning, babbling, ect.) (Non autistic people stim too, but it’s much more noticeable with autistic people.) 
Anyways I was at the mall and was a bit freaked out by the large crowd, so I started bouncing my leg and flapping my hands to comfort myself. A mother with two young kids was standing nearby and she kept giving me weird looks. I eventually asked her if I could help her with something and she told me to “Stop doing those things, it’s scaring my kids!” I apologized but told her I couldn’t because this was a copping technique I used and explained that I was autistic. She blew up at me and told me that I shouldn’t be so selfish and that being autistic wasn’t that hard. Am I the butthole here? I’m very confused because I find it hard to relate to people.

She was never diagnosed with anything but she is very clueless sometimes. I have had to spell things out for her a lot. Few months back, she borrowed a dress of mine. I really love that dress. There isn't any sentimental value but I got it when we were on vacation few years ago. She also loved the dress and one day just transferred the money to my account and told me that she was keeping the dress.

I spoke to her but she just told me that doesn't matter as she has paid me. Her birthday was a week ago and her mom asked me to bake a big cake for her. I usually sell cakes cheap (little more than ingredients cost). 

On her birthday, I went over to her house with the cake 15 mins before the party was due to start and then decided to talk to her mother. Like I said, sometimes my friend is really clueless sometimes and I was hoping her mom would speak to her and get my dress back. 

I was very shocked when she also said that as long as I was paid what does it matter. She told me to just move on as it was just a dress and that my friend really liked it. She told me as long the dress was paid for, what am I complaining about. 

I got really pissed off and pulled out the amount she paid me just paid me, put it on the table, picked up the cake and left. 

She got mad and started yelling at me that I was ruining the party. I kept walking back to my house. She kept telling me to give back the cake and that I couldn't take it back just because I want to be petty. I just asked what she was complaining about as I had paid back the money. 

My friend ended up having a cakeless 16th birthday because of this.

It was a pretty smooth transition for me as my parents had been divorced for over 3 years by then and I wasn't really all that close with my father. My sister, who was 13 at the time, on the hand other hand hated our stepdad. 

She would cry, throw a tantrum, tell him he's not her father if he ever tried to discipline her etc. Stepdad tried his hardest to be a positive influence in our lives, but she wasn't having it. She even bullied our stepbrothers, 11 and 14 at the time, going so far as to making fun of their deceased Mom. 14 would call her a brat and laugh it off, but 11 cried a lot. Any attempts to tell her off would result in her threatening to go stay with Dad and nothing was ever truly resolved. Even therapy didn't help much. And I must state here that my step brothers never bullied her, it was almost always one sided. 14 would put 11 in his place if he ever acted out 

Now that the context is out of the way, here comes the meat of this story. So our Stepdad has a lakeside cabin, and every month on the second weekend he'd take us children there, to help us bond as a family and to give Mom a break. It became somewhat of a tradition (one in which Mon would join in too, but only occasionally) and helped us come together as a family. My sister refused to go, and after a year or so, Stepdad stopped asking, telling her she's free to join anytime she so wants. She never did, until recently. 

We're in our mid to late twenties now, living in the same city. We've continued the tradition, but it's only once or twice a year, which increased during lockdown. My sister said she wanted to join in. Caught us all by surprise really, but Mom says she's been wanting to come ever since she graduated from college. Stepdad agreed and she came along. It was awkward, to say the least. My brothers don't really like her, they're civil around her, but that's it. Even Stepdad is tense and formal when she's around. It just kills the whole vibe. I guess she picked up on it and asked me what's wrong.

So I told her. That it's way too late to try and be a family now and things are just way too awkward. Why try and force a relationship at this stage anyway, right? She got really mad and upset and is refusing to talk to me. 

So. AITA?",2020-11-12 05:38:51,1048,10722,0.97,16,32,133,12,,4,,2,4,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was 13 then.

He fought for 50/50 split custody and won it. I took out all my anger and resentment on their household. I was an actual monster of a child while I was with my dad. But my mom had zero issues with me. I was also very well behaved in school.

But over the years, I've wrecked a lot of stuff around their house and was generally extremely rude to them. I made both my dad and stepmom cry more than a few times.

When I was 16, I stopped going over to their house. I mellowed out with them but I distanced myself from them.

I'm now 28 and recently married. I recently met my dad and stepmom at my grandparents house for an outdoor  BBQ.

My stepmom overheard me telling my aunt that I love being newlyweds in a new home. She got extremely upset and said I ruined that experience for her. And she said the least I could do was apologize.

I basically scoffed and walked away without even acknowledging her. I think my dad and her handled the situation poorly in general and should've been more proactive about dealing with my issues when I was a literal child.

We have three kids together (Ages 11, 8, and 6.)

I kept my ex husband's last name after we divorced. We're still friends and it was too much of a hassle to revert to my maiden name since I'd already graduated college and started my career with my married name. I also like having the same surname as my kids. My ex has never cared before, nor does my current boyfriend.

However, my ex recently became engaged to his new girlfriend. (together less than a year) I've met her only a handful of times, but she seemed nice enough and my kids haven't voiced any issues with her, which to me is the most important thing.

So I was shocked when out of the blue she contacted me a few days after they announced the engagement and asked that I revert back to my maiden name. I literally laughed out loud when I read her text, I didn't think she was serious at first but she was.

Her reasoning is that since my ex will have a ""new wife"" it would be wrong for me to keep his name. I essentially told her ""no f-ing way"" although a bit more tactful. My ex then called me and asked that I at least consider it since its something his fiancée *really* cares about, and that its not ""technically"" my name anyways. I let him know I wasn't going to go through the headache of changing it again, but if they were so concerned about names *he* should take *her* surname. My ex said I was ""being petty"" and asked me to just please think about it. I would have been happy to end it there but I got ANOTHER message from his fiancée which was basically a thinly veiled legal threat about suing me to change my name.

I didn't bother to respond to her message, you can't make someone change their name and I'm not concerned about some frivolous lawsuit at all. But I did screen shot what she said and sent it to my ex, telling him his fiancée needs to back the hell off, which he hasn't responded to.

My boyfriend also thinks the whole situation is stupid and thinks I should just tell them both to fuck off next time they say something. I don't know if I'm being an asshole though, I get its not my original name but its my professional one plus my kids' last name as well.

When all the Covid thing started getting out of hand we decided to open up our house to one of our friends(30F) and my bf's cousin(19F). The friend who moved in with us, Kate (fake name), lost her job before the pandemic and two month ago with the end of lease she couldn't afford a place to live.

My boyfriend and I have a common friend group that we knew since the college days, around 7 years. Kate joined this group 2 years ago. When our friends informed us of her losing her house we decided, hey, we have free space come stay with us for a while until you can find a permanent solution. We also covered the food expenses while she helped with the chores. She accepted and moved in within a few days.

When she first moved in she was acting friendly with me but as time progressed she started becoming colder and colder towards me but was still friendly with my bf. A month ago she started acting weird. While we were watching Netflix she started sitting in between my bf and me, touching or hitting his arm lightly when she was laughing, touching my bf's neck or hair while saying good morning to his ear or trying to massage him constantly. I didn't know what to do especially because my boyfriend was not saying anything at the time and i didn't want to be the crazy gf.

However he sat me down a week or so ago and told me he was extremely uncomfortable by the way Kate was behaving. Let me tell u I was so relieved that I was not the only one who was thinking she was acting strange lol. He said when im not around her behaviour only increases and he didn't know what to do because he was scared of telling me this as he thought maybe he was overthinking it. We decided to speak to her if she did it again and went to bed happy.

Two days ago I drove to my parents house to visit them and help with their needs as they don't go out. I got a text two hours into my visit from my bf asking me to come back home urgently. When I returned everyone in the house was yelling and I was very confused lol

When my bf saw me he said that he wanted to talk to Kate about what she has been doing was making him uncomfortable and apparently she didn't take this well because she said she did this with everyone and when I took my bfs side more yelling and calling names happened. We told her to get her things and get out.

I thought our friends would take our side when we told them about this but now the whole group is divided. Most of them said yes she was wrong if she was making us uncomfortable but that she is just a touchy person. And we were assholes for kicking her out in a pandemic when she had nowhere else to go to.

I trust my boyfriend very much as he has been nothing but an honest partner for the past 5 years. He said he decided to talk to her because she kept caressing his arm and touching his thigh and he hated it.

So I wanted to ask AITA for kicking her out?

EDIT: We talked to our friends and showed them the post. You guys were right about how she was telling a different tale. However, they were still not willing to take her in. Some apologized and we are not friends anymore with some of them as they thought me posting here was an asshole move even if I was right and for making them ""look bad"". She also apparently slept with one of the friends in the past and we didn't know that, not sure if that makes a difference. I showed the cousin the post and she confirmed that she heard bf talk to Kate in the hallway telling her he doesn't like being touchy before all this so that's for the ones that thought bf was cheating. Kate didn't have family close by so idk who she is staying with rn.",2020-11-07 17:45:41,1124,18273,0.97,5,0,257,2,,4,5,1,8,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I will let you, the strangers of Reddit decide.

My sister (29f) got engaged to her fiance P (34) 9 years ago. They are still engaged and going really strong. The reason why they didn't have a wedding is because both of them spent whatever they inherited and saved up to pay their loan for college and had to start fresh. They didn't have a problem with that and neither did my parents. It was their money and they decided how they wanted to spent it.

My sister wanted a big wedding but things didn't go according to plan them. Her fiance was diagnosed with cancer and whatever they were making, they were spending it on his medical bills and rent. Now, they have decided they want a small wedding sometimes around next year.

My sister's friend, who got engaged last week invited me and her to her small covid safe party and when she addressed the crowd, half of her speech was about my sister. She called my sister poor, dumb and not driven (indirectly) because she is now settling for a small wedding.She implied all these things and everyone in the crowd understood. The rest of the party was awkward and while I was talking to some other people, I saw my sister coming out of the bathroom and she had been crying. I asked her and she confirmed it was about what her friend had said. 

Before leaving the party, I went up to her friend and told her because she had a trust fund and rich parents helping her throughout her life, she didn't essentially have to lift a finger to survive (graduated college 7 8 years ago and still doesn't have a job). I told her  my sister was a fighter and that she was so much more braver and smarter than she will ever be and left.

She apparently cried to her friends and I got some colorful text messages but I don't care. It's when my sister's bf and my other brother told me that I should have kept my mouth shut, I am having second thoughts. My sister is grateful I stood up for her but also thinks  I took it too far.

I am literally half of each. My paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants. My mother is reservation born with family still on the reservation that she is close to. 

I am almost a clone of my late paternal grandmother. It's shocking how similar we look. The only difference is that my hair is dark brown while hers was a blonde.

I grew up kind of the black sheep of the family. They didn't like my Dad and it felt like they kind of took it out on me. My material grandmother made it a tradition to gift each girl in the family a set of handbeaded moccasins for their 16th birthday, I was excluded (until my Mom brought it up and my grandmother gave me a pair six months later.) My Aunt taught all of the other girls how to dance, I was excluded. The only thing I wasn't excluded on was learning how to drum.

My paternal grandmother lived with us, and she knew they treated me differently. She made it a point to teach me the folklore, her recipes, and all about our family. My sense of taste in decor is also very Irish

I moved far away from everyone after college and I really haven't looked back. 

One of the only family members I am still close was attending a work thing for a few weeks last year. I brought up that they could stay at my place since I was closer than the hotel to where they were going than the hotel his work offered to put him up in, and it was on my way to work with an almost identical schedule. They took me up on it. 

When my cousin arrived, he were absolutely shocked that my house looked so Irish and that there was no trace of my Native heritage. He accused me of assimilating into white culture. I pointed out everything he already knew that I was purposely left out of traditions and family events because I either look white or they hated my Dad, so why would I identify with a culture that rejected me first?

He told me that I should've tried harder to embrace my culture and show them that I wanted to be part of their traditions instead of just flat out dropping them all together. I told them that I shouldn't have had to try to be included by my family as as child, I should've just been accepted as family.

In the end, we agreed to disagree, until I noticed that he took my drum! I had it in the guest room closet because I had no room for it in my bedroom closet and didn't want it to get damaged by my asshole cats. I ended up calling him demanding the drum back and he refused. 

My drum was returned to me after my Uncle who gifted it to me took it back and mailed it back.

It ended up escalating so now my whole family is involved and calling me TA. 

TL;DR: I am mixed Native American/Irish and was alienated from the Native American culture by my family and embraced the Irish side. My cousin thinks I betrayed my culture. AITA?

**Edit: In response to the decor questions:

It's actually literal pictures of Ireland that I took with my professional cameras from my vacations there with my paternal grandmother. I'm not talking small prints, I am talking very large professional prints of the landscapes. I took so many pictures because I loved it so much that there are literally pictures of the landscapes, both rural and urban, in every room.

In my den and my bar, it has a lot of Guinness things. My husband even got me a Guiness tap.

I also have a lot of my grandmother's handembroidered things that are celtic embroidery or are very reminiscient of such.

My Son and eldest daughter are very close. They still fight but I wouldn't say is much as most siblings do, but whenever he wants to talk to her he just bursts through the door. If the door is locked, he just hits it with his shoulder until she opens it while at the same time, damaging the house. Whenever she asks him to stop, he ignores it and only stops for a day when we tell him to stop. He always talks about his privacy and the importance of it but disregards others.


Last week though, he caught her changing. She was very angry and upset and came to tell us about it. We sat down with our son and told him that if he can't respect other people privacy then he can't have his own. We then took off his bedroom door (He still has his bathroom door)

Before we started the unit, he explained to us that he is Jewish, and his great-grandpa was a victim of the holocaust and that he might get a bit emotional while teaching.

My teacher was explaining to us nazi standards, and he decided to use me as an example. I am a very pale, blue-eyed, blonde girl, but I have Jewish ancestors (i am not Jewish because I am atheist, but it is still my blood and my family that had to suffer.), which I guess he didn't know.  He looked at me and said, ""op, the nazis would've LOVED you. Actually, I wouldn't be surprised if you had nazi blood in you."". I was fucking appalled. I knew this teacher didn't like me, but he crossed the line when he compared me to a fucking nazi.

I'm not going to lie, I lost my shit. I got up and walked out the door and called my mom to pick me up. (no I am not supposed to just leave, but I did it anyway.) I told my mom what happened and she called the school and raised hell. She is friends with the principal and he insured her that he would either be reprimanded or released from his position.

(i forgot to mention the way he said it. He didn't say it like a teacher making a connection or something to explain better, he said it aggressively and was pretty snarky about it. Which is one of the reasons I walked out.

The principal said that he would be on probation (? don't know what that means for a teacher) and that he had to apologize. He refused, and quit that day. I don't know why he quit, he just did.

My sister has a great job and I’ve offered her monetary help for a nanny, but that got shot down quickly. I’ve got extended family and her in laws harassing me to take in the baby. I want to turn her  down without burning bridges and not take on something I am ill equipped for.

Edit to add:
It was a hard no from my daughter and husband, even if I bring on a nanny to watch her. I’m torn since I want her to be safe and cared for.


Edit to add: 
Getting cps involved could hurt her job since she is in a sensitive field.

Update:
I used the day off today to go visit my sister in person. Because the phone calls where just getting jumbled. Her husband was at his family’s place today and it gave us a chance to openly speak. He’s is leaving for a 60 day rehab soon. My sister feels she has post-partum issues and being in lockdown just made matters worse since there was no space or buffer between all that was going on between her husband and doing everything for the baby.

She wanted us to take her little one because the mess in her personal life, because we have given my daughter such a stable and ideal life. She couldn’t see past wanting that for her own little girl, that’s why she was adamant that I just take her. We spoke of her anxiety and depression and came to an understanding that she needs medical help.

In all of this mess my cousin who took early retirement to travel but now can’t due to the global problems, offers and will move in with my sister and I’ll still pay for a nanny. My sister feels she will have support to get her mental health back on track and be a good mother to her child. 

Thank you to the people who pointed out that it might post partum related. I’m glad I took the time to drill down the issues that where affecting her and not shut her out right. As of now my sister and the baby are both at my house till my cousin moves in next week and the agency finds is a suitable nanny. My family was on board since there where timelines and boundaries set for their stay.

She has been doing distant learning this entire school year.

I have had several issues with this teacher since the start of the school year. I have spoken to her numerous times when things have come up. 

For instance, her teacher has told the students, including my daughter, to use google whenever they need help figuring out a math problem while they are in school rather than asking her for help. She also always has her mic on, which wouldn’t be bad, except she was talking badly about parents and saying horrible things about the kids. I don’t know if she realized her mic was on at that time, but it was extremely inappropriate to say the least. She was very vocal about her political beliefs to the kids. Any kid that showed a different opinion was put on mute. I am a firm believer that teachers should not vocalize their political beliefs onto children. It is a very touchy subject for most people, especially now and teachers should remain neutral so as to not sway young minds. Each time, I have emailed her about it. I get it, this is all new to us and mistakes happen. It is a learning curve for all of us and that is okay. 

However, my daughter recently came to me because her teacher is now forcing them to write an essay about how they should get rid of turkey for Thanksgiving this year and go full vegetarian. The essay actually says that eating meat is unhealthy and goes on to talk about how unsanitary it is and how turkey contains salmonella and can kill you and that turkeys are killed inhumanely. It says to find the research to back up these claims and explain why it is better to be vegetarian.  

My daughter was not happy as turkey has always just been a tradition for our family. When my daughter brought it up to the teacher, my daughter suggested she could write an essay about how having turkey is a family tradition or about the pilgrims or about why turkey is a tradition for Thanksgiving. Her teacher told her that if she did not do the assignment as given, she would be given an F. 

When she told me and then showed me, I was taken aback and quite unsure of what to say. I’ve never had a teacher be so blatant with their personal beliefs and then shove them onto the kids for a grade.

She’s already told my daughter she would fail her if she didn’t do the assignment the way the teacher wants, so I am unsure if speaking to her privately would be beneficial to my daughter.

Their evidence that I’m not friendly is that I won’t participate in the “work fam after hours cocktail zoom” which is just everyone gossiping and complaining and getting drunk. Their other evidence of my unfriendly attitude is:

I don’t friend my coworkers on social media and while my job does not require any travel at all, I also decline invitations to anything that has me traveling past work hours for work or work-related things like weddings or parties of thrown or hosted by coworkers. 

The reason for this (and it’s not their business) is that before I started working for this company my husband and I were workaholics- both of us always traveling and sometimes gone at the same time for up to a week. We had a nanny who was also a blood relative who we thought we could trust. We could not, it turned out. She left the kids unsupervised to go hook up and there was a very preventable accident that if an adult had been present wouldn’t have happened. Both kids are fine and healthy now but still have nightmares and we’re all in individual and family therapy. My husband and I found other jobs and we’re both home (not now, cuz pandemic) by 3pm. Our children don’t stay with babysitters anymore but did/do go to after school programs and sports that they love. Our only line in the sand is that mom and dad are home, no questions. (We both still have hobbies and do other things, but no overnight work travel for either of us). This was hard-won peace and safety that I’m not compromising on. 

When I took this job I was in a great position to negotiate so it says in writing in my contract that I do not travel, work weekends, and that I’m not expected to do so and that my tenure with the company is never reliant on me traveling. They adamantly agreed and tbh my field doesn’t need travel or training or overtime anything like that. 

I explained to my manager why I don’t participate in the zoom parities and other activities - because my kids come first. She said I’m a helicopter parent and probably need some friends and downtime and that people are really upset I don’t hang out with them.  I reminded her about my contract and she said they don’t have to honor it if other people complain?

This made me feel intensely, weirdly guilty about everything.

So we were all talking for a little while and the pet name slipped out, I never said it in front of anyone before because I understand people might find it odd and boy her parents did not like it, they started saying I was being racist and clearly have double standards, Suzie tried to tell them to be quiet and said that she liked the nickname and if she doesn't feel offended by it then they shouldn't speak for her but they persisted and her dad came out with one of the funniest things I've ever heard someone say to me in the most sincere way possible.

""how would you feel if she called you her chocolate daddy?""

I started laughing and Suzie tried to hide her face but she looked like she was about to cry from hysterics, I told him I wouldn't really care if it wasn't coming from a place of malice and we decided to GTFO as soon as possible, anyway now Suzie has been receiving messages from her parents saying they still think it's racist and disrespectful and I should apologise and drop the nickname but she is sticking to her guns that it's no one's business, and she even started calling me ""chocolate daddy"" and honestly I can't stop myself from laughing whenever she says it, but still, I feel a bit bad for causing an argument with her parents and causing her to be getting hounded by angry messages.

Four years ago my parents divorced after my father decided he was done being responsible and left. He came back after more than a year and he married someone else and was helping raise her kids. He brought our mom to court for shared custody. He was granted less than 50% because he was out of our lives for a while. I wanted to stay with my mom but the judge said he would order an evaluation to be done if we disagreed with his decision. I didn't want to cost my mom more so I went along with it. But once I turned 18 I was done and I didn't go back.

I have nothing to do with my father. He left us and then expected me to be his nanny. His wife tried to be nice to us but she wasn't part of the equation in my eyes. My father had shit on my mom, left her with three kids and debt he got into, broke her heart and he abandoned his kids. So I was there for my moms sake so she wasn't paying a crapton for court.

I have been helping my mom out ever since I graduated high school (before really, but more now). I help with groceries and sometimes I go over to cook and stuff so my brother (16) can get his tutoring and help with homework (he has dyslexia and dyscalculia) and so my sister (14) can get the therapy and stuff she needs while my mom works. My father found out I was helping and was annoyed I don't do the same at his house. I told him I owe him nothing and they get nothing from me.

He claims I'm punishing his wife and her kids for his mistakes. 

I don't know why I honestly even gave this any thought but is it a dick thing that I really don't care to help out his wife or her kids? They're almost strangers to me. We're not family. Whereas my mom and my siblings are. Ugh. IDK.

I have mild Cerebral Palsy. It's not something that has a tremendous effect on my life, it never really has. People don't know I have it unless I tell them. Because of these factors, my condition simply isn't something I think about very often.

So I've been seeing this guy (25M) for a little while and I think he's absolutely brilliant. Incredibly handsome, smart and a bit dorky in a very adorable way. We've been on 4 dates and I got the impression that he was really into me, but on the fourth date a problem arose.

We hung out at his place for the first time, watched some movies and had sex together for the first time. We both had a fantstic time and there were just good vibes all around.

After that, we decided to have some beers and play games together. Now I can usually open beer bottles myself without a problem, but my hand was feeling extra weird that day, a bit crampy, so I asked if he could help me open it. Of course he asks me if everything his alright. I him tell him: ""Yes, I'm fine! I just have Cerebral Palsy and sometimes my left hand won't cooperate, it's usually not a big deal though.""

He proceeds to be very upset, telling me that I should have told him I have Cerebral Palsy before we dated, that I have decieved him, lied to him etc. The part that hit me hardest was when he said he would have probably never would have dated or had sex with me if he knew. I just don't understand why? Anyways, I felt bad and apologized profusely and said that because my condition is so mild, it's not something I often think about. Things got pretty awkward and tense after that, so I finished my beer and left shortly afterwards. This was a few days ago and he hasn't responded to me since. Sex is something very special to me so it feels weird to just be... ignored after?

I'm feeling like a bit of a shitty person right now to be honest, so I wonder, AITA for not telling this guy that I have Cerebral Palsy right away?

Alexis was a single mum of 2, a daughter who was born deaf and is now 11 and a son who is 6. 

Alexis never had anything nice to say about her parents, she was kicked out of home at 16 and ended up living with my family because, as her dad said to mine ""she's old enough to sort her own shit out"" and that she was a waste of space. She ended up going no contact with her parents after that. 

About 4 years ago her parents reached out to rekindle a relationship and she agreed to let the meet her and her kids. The ""rekindled"" relationship only lasted for a month because her parents were rude towards her daughter calling her an r-slur and saying she would've been better off born dead. They also showed clear favoritism towards her son and would buy him expensive gifts and ignore her daughter. Alexis got sick of their behavior, gave them 3 warnings and then went no contact again. 

About 2 years ago Alexis was diagnosed with an advanced stage of ovarian cancer. She had an immediate hysterectomy and started chemo but it had already spread to several other organs and her spine. We sat down and I agreed to take her kids after she passed. They get along great with my daughter(7) and my stepson(11 - who had learnt asl so he could talk to Alexis's daughter). In her will she explicitly stated that she didn't want her parents to have anything to do with her kids. 

So now Alexis has passed and both kids gave moved in with my family. Since the funeral Alexis's parents have repeatedly reached out and asked to see their grand son. I have repeatedly refused. 

They are proceeding to slander me all over SM and have been hassling my husband and the kids schools.

I (52f) am in an unusual situation and need an outside perspective but want to maintain my anonymity. 18 years ago it was revealed, at my husband's funeral, he had a pregnant mistress (40f). Obviously I didn't just take the woman's word for it and stated that she wouldn't get a cent until there was a DNA test. When it was proven true I was devastated but agreed to set up a trust for the child for college and agreed to let them live in one of my rental properties in a good area rent-free until her child was 18. She had to pay for utilities.

She agreed and I made it clear that I wasn't going to do anything else for her or the child. I also made it clear that I wouldn't take on the responsibility of fostering a relationship between our children and that it would be my husband's side of the family's job.

Fast forward 12 years and the mistress' child got sick and needed medical treatment. She didn't have enough money for what insurance wouldn't cover and reached out to me for support. I reminded her what our original agreement was and to borrow money from relatives for assistance. She said her credit wasn't good enough for a loan at the time and she didn't have anyone who she could borrow the money from. When I wasn't budging she got upset and accused me of being a monster for not helping a child in need. I reminded her that I already helped her child by setting up a college trust but she could use some of that money for the costs if she really needed it.

She agreed and her child pulled through. Now that the child is 18 and intending to go to college in the Fall of 2021 the mistress reached out to me about the trust and was upset when she found out that the amount was much less than what was originally agreed upon. I reminded her it was less because some of the money was used for the medical bills and that I never said I would put the money back in. I also informed her that I was going to start charging her rent the following year and she would need to pay or move out. I didn't care that she was upset because I was always straight forward about the situation but now my MIL and SIL are starting to say that it's unfair to the child. I don't see it that way because the mistress had at least 6 more years to figure something out so AITA?

Edit: Thank you so much for giving out your opinions and advice so far. However I do see some reoccurring comments and questions so I wanted to give more info just in case it changes your stance.

1. I am an American and live in the United States.
2. My husband and I were in our 30s and he died in an accident so there was no will. We were strong middle-class but not rich. My husband a Life Insurance policy that named me as the primary beneficiary and then our children, a house that wasn't paid off yet, $20,000 worth of his own savings, and two cars that was both in our names but also wasn't paid off at the time of his death. His mistress could've sued but it wouldn't have been much.
3. The rental property that I let her stay in was an inheritance from my side of the family that was solely in my name so my husband had no legal ownership of at the time of his death.
4. My MIL and SIL don't know the full details but they know I have enough money to the point where I could pay for the mistress' child to go to a decent 4-year school and not miss it, even during this pandemic. They on the other hand can't.

Edit 2: Also forgot to mention that because my husband died in an accident that I got some money for that too.",2020-11-03 19:35:54,1574,14662,0.97,0,0,215,0,,5,3,1,4,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,2,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My brother Jack (25) recently lost his job. Our parents do not have any space for him at their home so he moved in with me (23m btw).

I have a service dog, Ripley. He is a 6 year old saint bernard and an absolute gentle giant. I suffer from some pretty severe agoraphobia and anxiety, prone to panic attacks when I leave the house. Ripley is a godsend and has been helping me get my life back together.

Jack doesn't really like that I have a service dog though. He doesn't believe that mental health issues are a big deal and that I just need to 'get over it'. Which, let's be real, is a lot easier said than done. We've never been particularly close and he has often accused me of being an attention seeker.

Due to the fact that Ripley is a service dog, it is very important that I keep on top of his training and I have a strict routine that both Ripley and I follow. However, around three or four weeks ago I woke up to Ripley growling. Upon further inspection, I saw Jack holding a lead and trying to pull Ripley out of my bedroom. I intervened and Ripley ran to my side. Jack told me he just wanted to save me the trouble of walking Ripley and had taken it upon himself to do it instead. I explained to him that this is not appropriate and that I am the one who walks Ripley. He seemed to accept this at first.

But over the past couple of weeks he's been going out of his way to go against my wishes. He tries to feed Ripley at different times, tries to give him food off his plate, will try to pet him when we're out in public (when Ripley has to be focused) etc. Literally anything to undo his training (which he admitted kinda smugly one night when he'd had a drink). Eventually I snapped at him and told him give it a rest. He fired back that Ripley must be absolutely miserable as he has no time to be a normal dog. This is, of course, completely untrue. He then called me an attention seeker and said I'm not physically disabled so I do not need a service dog and that the only reason I had Ripley was to get attention from strangers. I threatened to kick him out and Jack went silent and left the room.

Later, I got several angry texts from family members for threatening to leave my own brother homeless. I do regret it as I think I went a bit to far, Jack is absolutely terrified of having nowhere to go and the threat might have been a bit cruel. But at the same time, Ripley isn't just a dog, he helps me. He calms me down from panic attacks, helps/gives me reason to leave the house and just generally makes my life easier. Undoing his training would completely destroy that. AITA?

\[EDIT\] 

First, thank you for all the support you guys. The kind comments really mean a lot and I've been trying to read each and every one of them.

I've seen a couple questions in the comments so I figured I'd just answer them here.

Ripley is a service dog, not an emotional support animal. He helps ground me during panic attacks, helps me remember to take my medication and brings my medication too me. I can't say the other thing he does because of the rules but when I'm in a dark place and try to do something I probably shouldn't, he is trained to interrupt me and prevent me from doing it.

My family know exactly what Jack is like. They all conveniently had no space at their houses to take him in as they don't want to deal with him. They also do know how bad my anxiety is and agree that Ripley is the best thing for helping me deal with it, if think any differently then they haven't let on. 

And thank you to the people who mentioned that having Jack here is making Ripley uncomfortable. I feel like a horrible person for letting him stay so long and making Ripley deal with that, he's a good boy and shouldn't have to be uncomfortable in his own home. I have texted several of my family members, including my parents, with my side of the story. Turns out Jack has twisted it a little bit. I told them that they're welcome to take him in but I cannot keep him in my home anymore as he is putting myself and Ripley at risk. Some family members are on my side now but there are still a fair few who think I'm an AH. 

And guess what? My parents are somehow managing to clear out their storage room to make space for Jack. Isn't that weird. 

Anyway, thank you again kind people of reddit :)",2020-11-17 19:29:34,794,8394,0.96,0,0,286,0,,3,2,4,3,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He asked me why several times and I would refuse to tell him. Until a month ago when I just said screw it and told him. I said I liked having my own room there and hated sharing with two other people at his house and his wife always annoyed me by expecting me to take on bigger responsibilities than she expected of her daughter. I told him I preferred being an only child in the home and not dealing with the chaos of a blended family.

He asked me why I never told him. But I did. He just didn't listen. He said it made sense for his wife to ask me to cook one family meal a week when I cook and her daughter doesn't. But that shit is frustrating and it made cooking a chore vs something fun which I know it can be IRL but I always enjoyed it before the expectation was put on me.

My dad was pissed after I told him. He said I was basically rejecting my family.

I M37 been with my wife for two years and I have a 9 year old son from my previous marriage with a congenital heart disease. He's in the last stage and is currently on waitlist for a possible heart transplant.

The problem is that he's sick most of the time. We had numerous visits to the hospital, He's currently on medication but he's always struggling with doing activities and playing just like other kids. The cardiologist told me about a device called VAD that would help and improve my son's condition.

I've looked into it. Spoke to other parents of kids who have the same condition and I decided to get my son this device and I was told the sooner the better so that my son could participate in activities and feel comfortable while breathing and limit hospital visits.

I been saving up money for this device and I was planning on making an appointment with the private clinic staff to have his operation done this month.

My wife is 4 months pregnant and she's been asking when I was going to pay for a nursery room for our baby and complained that i was neglecting our baby and still haven't gotten anything for him.

She started showing me different nurseries online that she thought were nice and she went crazy about one of them that costs nearly 3.500 she insisted that I get it but I told her that the money is for my son's operation. She said that this is my son as well. She criticized the doctor's recommendations and said that doctors are now ""advertising"" for many insufficient devices just to get money out of it and brought up what happened with her deceased dad and how they took his money and didn't treat his condition. I told her to drop it and she threw a fit calling me stubborn.

My wife made dinner for us and seemed quieter than usual then she brought it up again. I told her to stop but she went on about her expectations for me to be a good father to our unborn son and how I'm neglecting him already. I didn't even finish dinner and before I went into the bedroom she told me that she already called the store and pre-ordered the nursery she liked and that I should know because I will be paying for it. 


I lost it I yelled at her for doing this after I already gave her my answer. I demanded she cancels the order and she yelled back that I was being unfair and will be an awful dad who already failed once and how sorry she feels for our son. She told me this in front of my son.

We argued back and forth. She ended up going to her family and she's been there for two days now. She mentioned that she won't return home until I decide to be fair to her and her son and stop disrespecting her. I havent talked to her yet and i feel like I'm being pressured especially by her parents who told me that I shouldn't treat her like that when she's taking care of me and my son.",2020-11-04 01:39:09,1725,9826,0.96,4,0,178,3,,8,2,4,7,,5,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My daughter Anna, 25F, lives in a house my wife and I bought. It is not in her name, she only lives there and doesn't pay rent. We didn't buy it for her, we bought it as an investment property and allow her to live there while she attends school. It's 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms. Anna has been living here for 3 years and has had complete reign over everything there.

Our younger daughter, Melissa, 20F, aims to move out in the next couple of months to start school herself, starting January at the same school Anna goes to. Instead of having Melissa find an apartment on her own, we asked Anna if she could move in. Anna said no because she wants her own space, but we only asked out of courtesy: the answer is yes, Melissa is going to move in.

If Anna utilized all of the space this home affords her, we would have paid for an apartment for Melissa. However, Anna only uses one of the bedrooms (the others are storage at the moment), and the basement is completely empty. Melissa wants the basement in any case so it's not like Anna is sacrificing anything but her own privacy.

Anna's argument is that she loses privacy and autonomy as an adult living in the city. We don't see it as a big deal, plus we own the house and make all final decisions on it. Melissa is excited to not have to pay rent, in partial or in full. So everyone wins.

I avoid tv news as it increases my anxiety. I’m not avoiding what’s happening in the world but I prefer to read news. I don’t want the news on all the time like a permanent soundtrack to the year that is 2020.

If he’s watching it I’ll just put a podcast on. I get that it’s his routine - I just can’t talk about the news before coffee on a Sunday. But he’s been up a while and is waiting in the kitchen like a big news Labrador. 

This morning:

Pre-coffee me goes to make coffee. News is on. exchange normal affectionate morning pleasantries with News Labrador.

PCM: (puts kettle on) I’ll just put my podcast in if your watching. (Goes to put earphones in)

NL: don’t worry I’ll put it on mute. anyway nothing bad is happening this morning ...

PCM: that’s good

NL: ... And I can quickly paraphrase it

slight tension creeps into room. PCM adds coffee powder to cup. 

PCM: that’s ok

NL: its nothing bad

PCM: I know, I just don’t want to talk about the news. 

NL: but you don’t know what I was going to say. 

PCM: yeah I know, but it’s Sunday and I’m avoiding news. It makes me anxious.

NL: but what I was going to tell you wouldn’t  make you anxious 

PCM: I don’t want to talk about the news because it doesn’t help my mental health. 

NL: I don’t think it’s the news making you anxious.  you were anxious anyway.

PCM: (annoyed) yes I’m anxious. the news on a Sunday morning makes me more anxious. I wish you’d just believe what I’m telling you 

NL: alright you don’t need to get snappy with me. Anyway, did I try to tell you about the news?

PCM: just let me make my coffee

NL: did I try to tell you about the news?

PCM: (really snappy tone) News Labrador, just stop it.

Finishes making coffee in silence. NL Has A Face On. 

PCM: did you want to say something else? 

NL: I was having a really nice, joyful morning after an anxious week at work and then -

PCM: I’m expecting you to apologize actually, so we’re probably not on the same page about the conversation we just had. Have a think about it.” 

flees room with coffee on last word

my perspective - if i don’t want to hear about something and I say no politely that should be ok. I also didn’t like being told what is and isn’t making me anxious. 

NL perspective - he’s excited to tell me things, I was snappy and spoiled his morning. 

I feel bad for ruining his morning, but I think I’m right. However, we’ve all felt that solid conviction of I’M RIGHT followed by the slow sinking dread of - wait, fuck, it’s me. I’d like to know before we chat if I’m the AH, so I can apologize for my part without feeling like I’m undermining my quest to limit tv news in my life. AITA?

INFO: 

We have talked before about how I find tv news stressful, and talking about the news at times when it might overload me - like first getting up. He loves a good news rant and I don’t always have space for it. 

What he wanted to tell me was I think about Rishi Sunak and was covid19 or Brexit related. He was wanting to paraphrase the Andrew Marr show.  It was more that nothing new and terrible was happening than sharing something he was excited about. 

I do like him really I promise.

133,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jv9irm/aita_for_reporting_my_wifes_cousin_to_his_employer/,AITA For reporting my wife's cousin to his employer,"My wife's cousin is a sheriff's deputy in a southern US state.  He is in his mid-20s and I've known him for about a decade.  My wife and I live in a northern state, so I don't see him very often, usually just on Xmas or Thanksgiving.  I've never really had a problem with him, but for as long as I've known him he has struck me as entitled and naive. Becoming a cop has been his dream since before I knew him, and he's very proud of the fact that he achieved it.  Since we live so far away from most of my wife's family, there is a group chat with a lot of family members that people use to keep in touch. 

 Over the last year or so, my wife's cousin has a habit of posting videos and pictures of things related to his job that I disagree with.  Some of these include body cam footage of arrests, body cam footage of people in vulnerable or traumatic situations, and plenty of videos of insensitive jokes from him and other police officers.

Now, I'm no expert on police matters, but I'm pretty sure he shouldn't be sharing those things with people. Since it's not my family, I've kept my mouth shut to the group, but have told my wife privately that her cousin could probably get in trouble if he was found out for leaking these things to family members.  She said that her cousin is just very proud of being a cop and this is his way of looking for recognition and pats on the back because he has always needed to be praised. 

A couple weekends ago, he sent body cam footage of him and another officer mocking a person they were arresting for DUI. The things they said and the way they treated that man made me sick to my stomach.  It was like to them, this guy was less than human. They showed such a callous disregard for him as a person that for me, it was the last straw.  

I told my wife that since it was her family, I was going to give her a chance to say something to her cousin, otherwise I was going to contact his supervisor and let them know what he has been doing. She called her cousin to talk with him, but he literally laughed at her on the phone. He said these people are criminals so why should he give a crap what they think about how they are treated. After the call, my wife came to me and said her cousin is an a-hole and that its ok with her if I contacted his department.

So I looked up his department info, created an anonymous email, and sent over the whole collection of pictures and videos that the cousin ever sent out. After a couple back and forth emails from them asking questions about how I obtained those items, they thanked me for the information and I didn't hear back from them. A couple days later, my wife's aunt (cousin's mother) blew up the group chat looking for whoever contacted the sheriff because her son was now on (paid) suspension and desk duty.

I told them all it was me that did it.  Now my wife's entire family hates me and thinks I'm a huge a-hole. But my wife and I feel we did the right thing.",2020-11-16 16:16:45,640,12517,0.96,1,0,299,0,1,10,5,5,8,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I (21f) was a kid my half siblings from my moms first marriage did not take my arrival well. In part because their dad was an ass who didn't want my mom to remarry and poisoned them against me. In part because they thought it was gross that I wasn't their dads kid as well.

My mom actually let them go live with their dad after years of them acting out against me and my dad. They called us names, bullied me relentlessly and no amount of therapy and discipline helped. One time I was coloring a picture of my family and the oldest who was 13 at the time got into my face and told me to stop drawing us all because they hated me and didn't want someone gross like me being their family. My mom told him to apologize. He told her to get fucking rid of me. She took away all his stuff and sent him to his room. He blamed me. Told me if I had never been born his and my sisters life would have been better and that they and their dad used to pray together that I wouldn't be born. I was maybe like 5 at this point.

Another time my mom was trying to help the bond by taking one of them out with me at a time. And it was my mom, my sister and me this particular time. She wandered off repeatedly and said she didn't want to hang out with me. My mom tried really hard to get her to engage and we left when my sister found one of her friends there and told her I was still wetting the bed at 6 and wasn't I so gross. My mom punished her for that too. Again, it was seen as all my fault.

I think it might have been some after that when my mom agreed to let them stay with their dad. They still continued talking shit about me to their friends.

They invited mom to their birthdays and high school graduations but not me or my dad. I actually ended up with a lot of issues because of them. Low self esteem followed and I was bullied repeatedly in school. At first because of the esteem issues and then some kids knew my siblings didn't want me and used that to hurt me. At 16 I was diagnosed with depression and was in a really bad place.

I'm in a better place now and my siblings have apologized to my parents for how they acted. My parents want me to give them a chance to apologize to me and to be in my life. But I don't think I'll ever be able to. A lot of the stuff they said to me stuck in my head even more than a decade later. I do believe they might have grown and realized their dad was wrong to say and do what he did. 

My parents think I'm being unfair and have asked me to do it for them even if I don't want to do it for me or my siblings. I told them I can't.

There are two houses on the property, one that  my parents lived in and the other is a smaller house that my parents used to to rent out. When we bought the property, we moved into my parents' house and my parents moved into the smaller one. The houses are far back off the road. When you come down the driveway, you come to our house first and then my parents' house is further back.

The problem that we are having is that people, including my siblings like to speed down the driveway. Its a curvy driveway with pine trees lining it, so the visibility is restricted. Our worry is that someone would hit our kids when they are riding their bikes or would crash into us or someone else as they drive down the drive way. We put up a sign that says ""Children at play. Speed limit 5mph"", which has been very effective except for when it comes to two of my brothers and one of my SILs.  So, I put in a speed bump. That did the trick, although my brothers and SIL threw a fit.

Last month I was outside and saw my brother and SIL leaving my parents' house. They apparently didn't see me. My kids has some toys in our yard and my SIL (who was driving) drove into our yard and ran over the toys, breaking them. They then proceeded to laugh their heads off. They got back onto the driveway and that's when they noticed me. I texted my brother and he admitted that they did it because they are ticked about the speed bump.  I ended up banning them from the property. 

My mom asked me the other day if I would rethink our decision because she misses the grandkids coming over. So I called my brother and told him that he could come onto the property again but he had to park his car at the road and walk up. He angrily refused. My mom wants me to let him drive up but I honestly don't trust him or SIL. But at the same time, I feel bad because it's my mom and dad who are also being punished.

He was always nothing but supportive, so that’s how we built our life plans. But once our daughter was born, Jeff did an immediate 180 and started asking when I was telling my boss I wasn’t coming back from maternity leave. I was dumbfounded by this, especially since Jeff didn’t make enough to support the family alone, which I was frank with him about. He kept saying he would figure it out and I needed to trust him and quit.

The week before I was set to go back to work, Jeff told me that he’d gotten a new job that paid enough to make up the difference from my salary, so I could finally quit my job without worrying about money. This was confusing for me because Jeff and I were making around the same amount of money, and I couldn’t imagine where he’d find a job that suddenly doubled his income. Turns out he's taken on an incredibly high stress position that requires about eighty hours a week. He basically sleeps and works, that’s it. There are lots of days when the only time I see him to bring him his meals, and he hasn’t spent more than ten minutes at a time with our daughter since taking the new job. Jeff is adamant that since he’s sacrificing so much to support us, I need to step up and quit my job so his crazy workload isn't for nothing. His industry is NOT supportive of job hopping, so he either has to stick with it for at least 18 months or leave his field entirely. He's livid with me and keeps saying that everyone in his life told him to prepare for me to refuse to go back to work, so he was just doing what he thought was right.

So far I’ve been standing firm. I planned out my adult life to be able to do this—work a flexible job from home while my mom helps with the baby during the day. I’m afraid to let Jeff force my hand into making a huge life decision just because he wants the huge life decision HE made without consulting me to be “worth it"". Our relationship so far has been nothing but loving and wonderful, and I'm completely shocked by how he's acting now.

My issue is that Jeff’s parents, brother, and best friend have all approached me about how miserable Jeff is and how if I don’t stay home with the baby, he's going to spiral into serious depression. Apparently all four of them had been whispering in Jeff’s ear during the pregnancy that I’d cave on wanting to work the moment I held our daughter, and they, too, think I’m selfish for not doing so. I have nothing but sympathy for Jeff and have supported him as much as I can—taking over all of his household responsibilities and doing my darndest to bring him some cheer while he’s working. But I fear the kind of precedent it will create in our marriage if I allow him to control me like this. My mom and best friend support me, but my sister and dad say that since the ""statistics"" are on Jeff’s side, I should do what’s best for him and the baby and leave my job.

I [M37] lost my son in 2016 from leukemia. I was a single parent and taking care of my sick son on my own with no one to show support or offer help. He passed away at the age of 11 he always loved sports such as hockey,soccer,and he used to decorate his room with sports posters on the wall/sports related toys in the shelves/and th st kind of stuff.

When he was in and out of at the hospital he'd decorate his room even though he had little energy he loved to do it and considered his room his safe place. This is hard for me to even talk about because whenever I walk into his room and see his touch in the room and I'd feel him near. This gives me comfort knowing my son had happy days even though there were few. His room is the same and I haven't moved anything I just leave it like it is not wanting to ruin it.


I been married to my wife for 3 months now, my stepdaughter moved in with us last month and my wife told me she didn't like her new bedroom at all. She saw my son's room several times and said it looked nice but I didn't think she wanted it.

I have three rooms in my house, and my stepdaughter started insisting on taking my son's bedroom. My wife asked if I wanted to change my mind but I told her that this is my son's room and it will stay this way. My stepdaughter didn't like that and took it as in I have no respect and consideration for her feelings. I already explained to her but she won't understand. Even though her room is the same size as my son's.

My wife wanted to give the room to her daughter seeing that it's the right thing to do and said that I was giving it too much thought. I told her no and that was it.

But yesterday. My stepdaughter called me and told me her mom was busy moving her stuff into my son's room. She probably thought that I knew so she was surprised that I was upset.

I got home and my wife told me that all my son's stuff are in the other her room and all she did was just switch rooms. I couldn't believe it when I saw my son's room upside down. I was so mad I told her she wasn't allowed to take the room without my consent and she said that I wasn't being supportive and a good parent to my stepdaughter when I'm behaving like this. I told her this had nothing to do with her it's about my son's memory. The room has been like this for years and for her to empty it and move out his stuff like that felt wrong to me no matter how she tries to explain it.

She and my stepdaughter are being quiet and my wife thinks I'm being selfish and unfair to my stepdaughter even though I helped organise her room when she first moved in.",2020-11-07 22:42:11,1135,11972,0.97,1,3,196,7,,5,4,7,5,,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fast forward to three days ago, my sister and her fiancé announced their engagement but today my sister came over to talk to me, she was pretty upset and I was really concerned, it took her a while to tell me what was wrong and basically she told me that she doesn’t think her fiancé is the biological father of her baby because she had a one night stand like 2 or 3 days after they took the break in 2018 and her fiancé has no idea. 

I immediately encouraged her to just tell him because it’s pretty damn messed up but she’s refusing to, she keeps saying that it’s pointless and “why cause issues when everything is perfect right now.” So I told her that if she doesn’t tell her fiancé the truth I will.

I worked extremely hard in high school, was accepted into an excellent uni, took the maximum credits per semester, and will be graduating one year early from undergraduate. I'm currently deciding where I want to apply for medical school.

My twin did well in high school and was accepted to a great liberal arts college, but never wanted to further his education beyond a Bachelor's degree. He's not as certain or as driven as I am about what he wants to do in the future, and is still exploring majors.

We each have our own college fund. They began with equal amounts. Both our universities charge tuition by the semester. I'm studying incredibly hard to shorten my undergraduate time so I can use the remainder of my college fund to help pay for med school and minimize the size of the loan I need to take out.

He can graduate in the standard 4 years easily by continuing at the same pace(3-4 courses a semester) or could even graduate a semester early due to the 30+ AP credits he has from high school. His friends at school have roped him into living the ""college experience"" and convinced him to  take extra semesters for easier course load(1-2 required classes per semester with a lot of electives). In short, he will need about 2 EXTRA years of university which will cost nearly $100K. My parents tried telling him that taking 5 or 6 years was unreasonable financially (a burnout/mental health gap year is an option because that doesn't cost money), but he just blocks their calls saying that he knew that they would say that because I've always been their favorite child.

When I graduate, I will have a substantial amount left in my fund on top of the money I get from my part-time job. Depending on the circumstances, I'm planning a one week DisneyWorld vacation after I graduate that I'll be paying for myself. (Edit: Clarification- I'm getting a part time job at the cafe next year to pay for it, not using my parents' money) My parents feel guilty and keep hinting that they want to use the money in my fund to help HIM pay for his undergraduate degree since he doesn't have a job or scholarships (I applied relentlessly since high school and enter competitions so I accumulated a few hundred dollars here and there, but it's not as if I have a full-ride to school- I have maybe $4-5k). They think that it's selfish that I'm flaunting DisneyWorld, and I could take out a loan for 100% of my medical school or wait a few years since it's not as necessary as a Bachelor's degree for him.

AITA for telling him he's a selfish brat and not taking any of my money? I don't think it's fair that I worked so hard since 9th grade to have him reap the rewards of my efforts. I'm incredibly angry and not talking to anyone at the moment, but my parents argue that it was their money in the first place and theirs to do as they wish and for me to not be feel entitled to their money.

TLDR: My twin and I have equal college funds. I'm working hard to graduate early and use the rest of the money for med school, he wants to chill and take a few extra years for the ""college experience"" by using my med school money. I said kick rocks.

I was in an accident last December that killed my best friend &left me paralyzed from the waist down. This is a dramatic change in my life that I still struggle with, not being able to walk again, losing someone I love, dealing with survivors guilt and other emotional stuff that leaves me in a dark place.

Before this, I was never religious and neither is anyone in my family except my cousin. She’s tried for years to drag everyone to her church. 
It feels like ever since this happened, she’s used my accident to prove God is great because there was a high possibility I wasn’t going to make it and he “saved me.” It’s all she talks about with the family.

While dealing with all the physical and emotional trauma that comes with this, my cousin hasn’t stopped bothering me about going to church with her to thank god for this miracle, which still doesn’t feel like that to me but I’m trying to work that out in therapy.

I’ve told her *many* times that’s not my belief and church is the last place I want to be.

It’s got worse now that the church services are online so she literally comes to my place so we can watch together. I ask her to leave and it takes a few times until she does. 

I reached my breaking point last week when again she insisted when we were all having breakfast. At the table she talked about God having a plan and how sometimes he makes things happen *mentions my accident* so we can open our hearts to him. 

So I asked her, “you’re saying God’s plan was to almost have me killed and leave me in a wheelchair just so I could thank him for not killing me after all?” My cousin didn’t know how to answer that and I bitterly told her “no offense but *your* god sounds very toxic.”
A few of my cousins thought it was funny but everyone else didn’t know how to react. Then we just changed the subject but she didn’t talk anymore after that.

Ofc I get the txt from her about how she was just trying to help and she deserves an apology for being so disrespectful about her religion. Everyone is kind of annoyed with her too and my mom says she doesn’t like the way she’s been using my accident either. My dad feels I did go too far and should’ve just kept my mouth shut because in her mind, she believes she is in fact helping me.

I’m glad I at least have some peace since she’s not talking to me but she now she’s spreading word around that I insulted her when all she’s done at this point is “help” me through this period in my life. 

Don’t know if I was being a justifiable a-hole, complete a-hole or not one at all. Guess I’ll leave that to all of you",2020-11-18 04:39:21,769,5465,0.96,0,0,331,0,,5,4,5,3,,5,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I (27F) have a (technically half-) sister who is 18 and a senior in high school. She’s super bright, kind, and excels in sports, but she’s been making bad choices the past few years. She was suspended for a bit due to weed, she failed some classes, and she unfortunately got pregnant back in June. 

Her ex and his family wanted nothing to do with the pregnancy, especially since they come from a culture where marrying from another nationality is forbidden. She thought the baby had been conceived back in April, but she didn’t realize till late June and she’d been drinking and smoking heavily.

Our mom is very conservative so sister ended up asking me for help. She originally wanted to keep the baby, but I told her it would drop a nuclear bomb on her life. I pointed to our cousin who had a teen pregnancy that killed her college plans and relationship. I suggested abortion or adoption, and she was very reluctant to “have someone else take her kid.” With adoption ruled out I indicated her towards abortion. 

We went to the neighbor state so she could get a surgical abortion, and I paid. I thought all was good. 

But now she’s blowing up my phone about how I made her kill her baby and she’s going to tell our mom. I told her I didn’t make her do anything and she’s welcome to tell our mom, but it won’t go well. With thanksgiving coming up, we are going to see our little nieces, and I think that brings up some feelings for my sister. She also managed to get early admission to a college, she I think moving on with her future makes her feel guilty. 

AITA? I feel like I was honest with her, not pushy.

Edit: sorry for the delay in responding to questions. My sister came to me for advice, but at first I just explained the pros and cons of each option and had her make columns for each. She seemed to think that the courts could make her ex get back with her and be a dad/ breadwinner, so I explained how child support worked. The kid only makes $500 a month, so she’s hardly going to get rich off child support from him. 

Finally, she asked outright for me to imagine myself as her and tell her what I’d do. I said abortion. That’s when she agreed that it was best. 

Our mom would never let her go to therapy — she’d probably kick her out first. Mom is a Q person and very anti rational thinking in general. I agree that she shouldn’t be hosting thanksgiving, but it’s like talking to  a brick wall. The best I can do is refuse to go to it myself.",2020-11-22 19:21:02,552,5013,0.96,17,28,156,3,,2,2,3,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My husband and I were so excited when we found out because a few years ago we suffered an unfortunate loss of our baby at 24 week gestation. Our baby just wasn’t developing correctly and there was nothing we could do. It was just one of those sad things 

I went to therapy for it, and came to terms with it but my husband never did. As much as I asked and begged he didn’t. 

Now, every time we go to a doctor appointment, he essentially has a panic attack going, during and coming back talking about how we are going to lose this baby too. It’s been happening since we found out, so that’s 29 weeks of this. 


I go to doctors appointments fairly frequently due to some minor issues that have caused me to be considered high risk. 

After my last appointment while coming home my husband told me we should start considering the worst and looking into urns and cremation in case we lose this one too. 

This is where I told him he needed to go to therapy and I wouldn’t be having him come with me because he stresses me out and that’s not good for our (healthy) baby and for my blood pressure which is what is making me high risk until he does get therapy.

He told me I’m being unreasonable and he’s being realistic, and that I can’t stop him from going with me because it’s his baby too. This was last week and he has been cold and still hasn’t made a therapy appointment and honestly has been kind of hostile towards me. 

I know he’s just scared we’re going to lose our baby but having him with me is maybe the cause of what could make us lose our baby because he makes me so stressed

My boyfriend told me that I was crazy for wanting something THAT expensive and he wasn’t going to spend almost $500 on a bag. To be clear - he isn’t financially unstable, he actually makes a decent amount of money. He just didn’t think it was reasonable to spend that much on a bag. I was honestly fine with this, i didn’t get upset or anything. It’s just a bag.

Fast forward to this week, my boyfriend keeps bringing up the new PS5 and he’s fully expecting me to purchase it for his birthday early next year. I absolutely cannot afford it. I work minimum wage whilst studying at university, if i blow that much money my bank account is going to suffer. Not to mention - why would he expect me to buy him a gaming console after he blatantly refused to buy me a Coach bag that is probably $200 cheaper than the PS5? I mentioned it to my boyfriend and he told me that there’s an enormous difference between a purse and a playstation and I can’t compare them, then he proceeded to call me immature.

My daughter’s English teacher refuses to pronounce her name correctly. 
She has a Japanese name and we live in Japan.  Her name is Kanae, pronounced Kaa-Naa-EH.
Recently, Kanae told me that her English teacher(an expat from America) at school calls her “Kah-Nye”. She told me that she told the teacher “My name Kanae. It’s three claps (syllables)”. But the English teacher told Kanae that she was incorrect, and that grammatically speaking that she , her teacher, was correct.
During my daughters sports day I “confronted” the teacher . I explained that my daughter would like the be called “Kaa-naa-eh”. But she laughed and said she was pronouncing it the way it’s “supposed to be” but will try her best to remember.
Today, my daughter told me the teacher still calls her Kah-Nye. My daughter is very very shy and it took a lot for her to correct her teacher the first time.  

I’m considering going to the school in the  morning. But is that an over reaction?



(For some clarity; I am not Japanese, my wife is so our kids are mixed-race. Our kids are fluent in English and Japanese. )

:::::oh wow! I wrote this late at night and went to sleep. I didn’t expect it to get this much attention! Thank you for all of the responses. I can’t reply to them all. But this morning we couldn’t go(son had an earache) but we are going there after school ends. We asked our daughter if she wanted us to tell. She said that she didn’t care.  We don’t want the teacher fired, we just want our daughter respected in her classroom::
⛩⛩
Update: I’m not sure where else to place it:::

But my wife and I went to the school today around 3:45pm. By then the English teacher in question had gone home. 
We told the principal everything that I’ve told you all and he was extremely apologetic. He did say that maybe it was a language barrier. But I reminded him that my daughter and I both told the teacher in English how to pronounce Kanae.

So then the principal called her dispatch company (Interac it turns out). The same thing happened. The company apologized but tried to pass it off as a language barrier thing.

More apologizes were issued when we told them
we spoke English. 

We were told that interac would speak to the teacher, and that they would handle it.

They principal asked us to come to the school Monday morning. I’m hoping to talk to the teacher face to face on that day.

❤️💚Final (maybe) update.  This morning I met with the school board, principal, the dispatch company, and the teacher in question! I honestly didn’t expect everyone there. 

It was very traditional Japanese apology. Deep bows from everyone (even the American teacher). She wrote (I think it was written for her because it didn’t sound natural and she made several mistakes)

I don’t remember it word for word but it said 

“ I sincerely apologize to the (our family name) and most sincerely to Kanae(she said it correctly). I now realize how important names are to the Japanese people. Please accept my dearest condolences(yes this was actually said).”
The teacher promised to treat Kanae with more respect.
She also apologized for not respecting me during the sports day. 

Honestly the only “real” thing that she said is when Kanae was brought in and the teacher kneeled down and said “Kanae. I am really sorry”. 
It seemed heartfelt 

Kanae being Kanae made the teacher a card

I forgive her.  So does my daughter. I have no idea what is going to happen career wise however.  Her company seemed very very upset.

But my daughter feels better

I was born and raised in America. A large majority of my childhood friends are Indian and I love to catch up with them. 

I’m the first of my friend group to have a baby. I was expected to be the last to have one, but life happens. I love her very very much and she’s the main focus of my friend group. Her father (38M) is white and my baby looks predominantly white. For reference, my skin is tan and lighter than some of my friends, but I still look very Indian. 

My friends and I decided to have an outdoor lunch together for the first time since February. I take covid very seriously because of my baby (now 6 months) but the cases in our area are very low and we all agreed to go to a place with less crowd. We were very safe. 

My friends and I were all sitting at a table and were having a great time. A white family later came to sit next to our table (still pretty far from us, more than 6 feet). 

My baby was laughing pretty loudly and babbling. She was being the happy little baby that she is. I had dressed her up in a lavender dress and she was wearing a little matching bonnet. 

A lady from that family noticed us and walked over to us, without a mask and pretty close to me and my baby. I immediately started to put a mask on my baby. 

She started talking to me and complimented my baby and then asked me where she came from. Her exact words were “How cute! That baby is just adorable! I just want to eat that little face up! Where did she come from?” 

I was so confused and put off by that question. I didn’t know what she was talking about and my immediate response was “Umm, well my vagina?”

My friends all looked so confused and irritated and we were just super awkward. The lady was offended and told me that I could’ve just told her that my baby was mine and I didn’t have to be so rude. 

She then huffed off and my friends and I were left pretty angry and confused. We carried on with our lunch and then when we were leaving, the lady’s husband and son walked up toward us and told us that we disrespected her and asked us if we had any lessons in basic manners. 

We didn’t say anything to them because frankly, we were scared. I’m putting this story here because I want to know if what I said was wrong and if I brought this situation on myself. AITA?

Edit: Wow, I’m overwhelmed with the response. I showed this post to my friends and we all laughed at some of the replies. 

In regards to my baby and the mask, I’m a new mother and I’m young, please cut me some slack. My boyfriend is the one who’s the baby expert and I try my best to keep up. I tried to do what was best to protect the baby but I hear that I was wrong. Baby doesn’t go out at all except to doctor visits and I only put a mask on her because of how close the lady was.",2020-10-28 23:08:57,1753,18266,0.95,1,1,167,0,,13,4,10,10,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three weeks ago, i told my sister (30f) something I shouldn't have. I told her that I do not want to marry the man I was engaged to, because I have fallen in love with a woman (unimportant but no, she doesn't know and i won't tell her. I just don't want to marry him anymore).  I have always trusted her to have my back and she promised not to tell anyone. As you've probably guessed already, she did. To be specific, she told our parents before I had the chance to do so. She then lied to me and said that I had to go home to explain the situation in person. As it turns out, she and my parents were planning to take my passport from me and make me go through the ceremony anyway, and that they were arranging for therapy for my acting out. The only reason I have this information is because my grandmother called to tell me and made me promise not to go back. 


I always knew that this wasn't something they could support, but they always said that I would not be forced and that my feelings matter. I didn't think they would try to control my ability to travel.

I feel sad and terribly betrayed that I can't go home now.


Before all of this, when i moved away from home, the plan was that my husband and I would get settled, and that we would pursue permanent citizenship. After this, my sister's oldest son (11M) would come to live with us so that he can learn english and have better opportunities for the future. I was made a guardian for this purpose. When I found out what they were planning to do, I texted my sister and told her that I never wanted to speak to her again, and that I would not be coming home. She said that I was being selfish and not thinking about others, and that I was breaking my promise and ruining my nephew's chance at success. She said that if I don't come home and resolve the situation, our parents and her husband would never allow her or my nephew to travel either, but that if i settle down with my ex-fiance and show that I have improved my ways, they will forgive me and allow me to return with my nephew.
I told her that I had no interest in helping her anymore, even if it meant that my nephew might lose his chance. 

Today, i received messages from our parents and her husband saying that I am a terrible person for sabotaging her child's future, and that I owe them because they paid for me to come to this country so that I can improve the situation for our family, and that I need to return home so that they can help me honour my commitment.


I feel terrible about this because they have all helped me financially as an investment, and I am breaking a promise to a child who has done nothing wrong. At the same time, I do not think it is fair for my sister to hold me to a promise when she couldn't keep hers, especially when I am not the one refusing to let him come. ",2020-11-27 06:51:53,364,5613,0.97,2,1,202,0,1,4,2,2,1,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I(21f) lived in a house with my disabled great aunt until about three years ago when she passed. She left me the deed to the house. I've been living in it ever since by myself. The house itself is a four-bedroom, three-bath, two-story house. My aunt had the downstairs modified to be wheelchair accessible when she became confined to a wheelchair, but she never bothered to fix up the 2nd floor because she never went up there because her room and office was downstairs. I eventually moved I at 14 and took over the upstairs.

When I lost my job because of covid, I decided to rent out the extra two rooms downstairs, because I don't use them. I was very reluctant about living with a stranger, but I needed the income. So I eventually found Brian (26m), who is in a wheelchair due to a car accident that left him paralyzed in his legs. He rented out both rooms, one for his bedroom and the other for an office.

I'm not going to lie, the fact that he's in a wheelchair makes me feel better about having a stranger living in the house. Because I know he can't hurt me. We've been living together since June, and we get along pretty well. He's a nice guy. But he's been hassling me about getting one of those chair things for the stairs so he can go to the second floor, but I've been refusing. I told him that the downstairs is wheelchair accessible so there's nothing he can get upstairs that he cant get downstairs and that the upstairs is my space and he doesn't have a right to go up there.

I think I'm NTA, but my brother disagrees. AITA?//

(edit. I do realize he could still hurt me, but it would be difficult.  He is totally paralyzed, absolutely no used in the legs. And while I bet he does have the arm strength, I'm a 150, 5'4 woman who was a powerlifter in high school. I could most definitely overpower him if need be. He is paying for the two rooms and use of the common areas (bathrooms, one guest, and one that is privately his, living room, kitchen, dining room, backyard,).

A couple of months ago, I decided I needed to gain some weight. I am technically underweight and honestly I didn't really like the way I looked or felt. I found a bunch of ways to add some more calories into my diet, and one of those was actually eating breakfast. In the past I rarely ate breakfast, and I never ate a breakfast that was a whole meal.

So I started cooking myself breakfast every day. Not only is it delicious and helps me gain weight, but I also enjoying relaxing in the morning by cooking something. I make a lot of different things, but to give you an idea, this past week I've made waffles, breakfast burritos, egg sandwiches, and oatmeal.

When I first started cooking breakfast, my parents and brothers (who work from home at the moment) asked me if I could make some for them too. I said sure because I was already cooking so it didn't bother me. Since then I've been making five portions of breakfast every morning, and everyone has been enjoying it. And I've gained five pounds!

About a week ago though, my parents and my oldest brother went on sort of a health kick. They decided they wanted to eat healthier and cut down on how much fat and sugar they were eating. That's not really what I need personally, but whatever, I don't care what they eat. They decided to swap out sugar with Stevia, buy these healthy yogurts with no sugar, and swap out butter with margarine. They also decided that they wouldn't cook with fats anymore, they would just use Pam.

My other brother and I don't follow any of these things. Personally I think I'm healthy enough, and the amount of sugar and butter I eat isn't going to kill me. So I still put sugar and butter into breakfast and cook with butter or oil too.

Yesterday, we were all eating breakfast, and my dad asked me what was in the waffles, so I told him flour, butter, sugar, etc. He seemed surprised and asked why I didn't just use the Stevia and margarine. I told him because I don't really like them and I'm trying to gain weight, so using low calorie alternatives doesn't seem like the best idea. Then my dad asked me if I could just switch to Pam when I cooked stuff, to reduce the calories a little. I told him absolutely not.

Since then, my mom and other brother have tried convincing me. I've told them no several times, and now they're angry that I won't compromise. I told them if they wanted to use their low calories stuff, they could cook themselves. They think I'm being inconsiderate of their health and that I'm just being rude. My dad even went so far as to threaten to stop buying sugar and butter if I wouldn't be more considerate of them. I think that if I do compromise, eventually they'll ask me to swap out more and more stuff until I'm barely eating more than before.

149,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/johlrk/aita_for_not_trying_to_reunite_my_daughters/,AITA for not trying to reunite my daughters?,"I have two daughters Kay (26) and Layla (22), As a single mum I tried my best for both of them. But Layla, while I love her, makes it very hard to do so at times. 

She’s always been attention seeking, stubborn, and jealous. We did family therapy and individual therapy for years  after her dad passed away when she was 9 but something snapped in her.

AITA part, when Kay was 22 (Layla 18 at the time) she had a boyfriend Mick (20), he seemed nice. Unfortunately Layla NEEDED all of his attention. It was constant, he’d be over at our house on couch watching a Movie with Kay and Layla had to be right there next to him. When they went out Layla chucked a fit if they didn’t invite her. She messaged him CONSTANTLY. 

She even went to his soccer games (skipping work at her job) when she hadn’t seen him in a while. Sending him pictures of herself, crying when I would ask her to get out Kay’s bedroom when they wanted to be alone.

I tried to put my foot down when Kay complained, I had a talk with Layla about boundaries and managing jealousy and how maybe we should got back to therapy. She didn’t want to listen and she was cold. She started getting more secretive and Mick started withdrawing, it was then I walked in on them on the couch when I got home from work. 

I’ll be real, I was not calm, I screamed, the whole neighbourhood could probably hear, I banned him from the house. I threw her clothes at her and told her to get to her room, I called Kay and asked her to come home. Mick must have gotten to her before me she came home a mess. 

It was one of the worst days on my life after loosing my husband honestly, my daughter was devastated and it was my other daughter that did it. Once Kay calmed down she asked me to take her to my moms house and I did. When I got back I went to talk to Layla, she was sobbing, saying I ruined everything. That I hated her, that I was always ruining her life, that they were meant to be together, I held her despite wanting to scream some sense into her. 

When the dust settled we talked, she fought any sort of blame, accusing her sister of abusing Mick, of Kay keeping them apart. As gently as possible I told her that while Mick is awful, what she did is also terrible. She needed to apologise. She refused.

That’s not even the half of it, but the relationship has been strained for the past few years. Kay has moved on and I am close with Kay and he’s husband, I’m careful to never talk about Layla and to be respectful of Kays boundaries. Layla however, begs for information about Kay, wants me to tell her everything, whines about how it was in the past, how she needs to get over it, I’m kinda ??? I just told her ‘what do you expect? You never apologised, what you did was wrong, I love you but I’m not the one to rebuild this relationship anymore, you’re not kids’.

She didn’t like that, and while I feel like I’m respecting Kay’s boundaries, even my mom says I need to try harder to reunite them, so AITA?


EDIT: for clarification on a few things, Kay asked to go her grandmothers after what happened. She couldn’t be in the same house as her sister, I couldn’t move Layla because she was locked up in her room. So Kay decided she needed to leave, this was in no way me dropping her off to comfort Layla. I got home at 1pm to find them and after Kay had come home soon after and I’d calmed her down she asked to spend some time at grandmas and I said yes, I was with her till 2am the next morning till she fell asleep between my mother and I. I left to go home, I checked on Layla, and I know I might be an AH, but she is my child too, she despite getting herself into this mess, was incredibly distressed. Maybe I was too gentile with her, maybe I should have yelled or gotten more angry. But In hindsight I don’t regret the decision to be there for both my daughters, when I looked at Kay I saw heart break and betrayal and when I saw Layla I saw a very scared, broken person. 

Kay made the decision to stay at her grandmothers, she did so for a little while, then I helped her move to her own place. I visited almost everyday, I went for dinners at her house. We had sleepovers, I went to doctors appointments with her, we started doing pottery together. I tried really hard to be good for her.

Layla has not been out of therapy for more than a few months since she was 10. Her diagnosis has always been unclear, but she does suffer from OCD, PTSD from her fathers passing and anger issues from when I last had anything to do with her therapy. Obviously she’s an adult, if she’s learnt anymore about her condition she hasn’t shared it. 

Layla moved out just before she turned 20, the year and a bit after what happened was very hard. Between trying to hold her accountable and not ruin what I had with Kay it was difficult. 

And finally, I never claimed to be perfect, I suffered a lot with post natal depression after both my girls and while when Layla was younger she did show signs of being harsh and unkind at times, I was working two jobs with a terminally ill husband. Maybe I didn’t pay enough attention to her, maybe therapy should have started sooner, I feel like there’s so much I could do better. And I wish I’d had their dad with me to help us. But it was just me and I did what felt right at the time. 

All in all this has felt extremely cathartic, and I wanna say thank you to everyone who cared to read and comment. I think it’s time I talked to someone myself.

My coworker Gio (40M) and I (30F) have worked together for 6 years and we are good friends. We have this running joke where the two of us refer to his former boss Drew as his boyfriend. Drew was a prick to everyone in their team except Gio, he gave him all the good accounts and he even endorsed Gio for a promotion even when Gio only met 70% of his targets. (I don’t begrudge Gio any of this since we didn’t even belong to the same team when Drew was his boss.) Drew is straight as an arrow, is notorious for being a womanizer and was fired last year for sexual harassment.

I should clarify that Gio and I refer to Drew as his boyfriend only when it’s the two of us who are talking, though our coworkers know the joke because we sometimes talk loudly. Gio is fine with our running joke and also refers to Drew as his boyfriend when we talk. For his birthday this year I photoshopped his and Drew’s faces into a gay couple’s picture and included it in my email greeting to him. He laughed at it for a good half a minute and then forwarded it to several coworkers who also got a kick from it. 

Our new coworker Kate, who has been with the company for 2 weeks, overhead one of my and Gio’s conversations where I called Drew Gio’s boyfriend so she thought Gio was gay. When she mentioned it to our other coworker Cory, Cory told her that Gio is straight, married and has kids, and the thing about Drew being Gio’s boyfriend is just a long-time inside joke between me and Gio. Kate went straight to HR to complain about me making jokes about Gio’s sexuality.

HR spoke to me and Gio, who told them that it was a long time inside joke between us that he took part of. I was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing, but it pissed me off that Kate didn’t even talk to Gio to ask if there was actually an issue. I’ve been avoiding her ever since because I honestly don’t know what I should even tell her after what she did. My boyfriend says I shouldn’t be angry at her because she was new and didn’t know our inside jokes yet, but my point is that while I understand that while Kate thought she was trying to do a good thing, Cory already told her it was a long-time running joke, and Kate didn’t even talk to Gio if her concern is something that she should really be concerned about.",2020-11-09 14:30:56,1203,6955,0.97,83,6,35,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am also comically short at 4'11. I look like a fucking child from behind and with my mask on its hard to tell from the front. I have people treat me very condescending because of my size. Because of my American husband I celebrate Thanksgiving. I'm actually just in it for the food because its as close to my mum's Sunday roast as I'll get this year since I won't be able to go home for Christmas as usual.

Anyway, my local Walmart is open now until 11pm and I got off work at 10pm. I had to get a few Thanksgiving extras, around twelve items. The store had already shut down the self-checkouts and had only three human-cashier lanes open. I got in one to wait. The store was quite dead being a small-town but I had gotten in behind a woman with two full carts so I had to wait a bit.

This older man, probably 50s, looking like what someone might refer to as a ""Redneck"" got in my line with a very full cart. The woman ahead of me was close to finishing at that point. The man looked at me in the fucking eyes and queue jumped. I'm not usually very confrontational but I told him I had been waiting first and he needed to get behind me.

Fucker looks me in the eye and tells me to fuck off, he isn't going to take orders from a kid, and that I shouldn't be in the store so late with my mum. He turned away and I was fuming. Anyway, he gets on his mobile and takes his hands off his cart. I grabbed thr fucking thing and gave it a good shove down the aisle, across the main walkway and into girls clothes.

He lit into me, cussing and whatnot, called me an alien, got in my face. He went to get his cart, I went ahead and unloaded my stuff on the belt. He got in a new line. When I got home and told my husband he told me next time to avoid starting drama and just let it go because it could have escalated. Apparently its unwise to confront people in our town at Walmart so late. My husband also made a point of saying that because I'm British and black someone might become dangerous.

I F33 lost my husband in an accident and he passed away shortly after he arrived at the hospital

We have two girls who are 9 and 5 and It's been very devastating and very difficult to be taking care of them while going through these tough times. My mom would help a lot and I'm so thankful for that.

My in-laws have been keeping to themselves but my brother in law would visit often to see the girls. He has always wanted kids on his own but hasn't been able to because his wife has medical issues.

He treats my girls well. And has been generous but treats me poorly and makes comments and criticizes my parenting often. He implied he wanted to be their guardian but I told him no.

He started demanding I bring the girls over to my in-laws house. And would get upset when I tell him I have work. He'd claim I'm clearly not taking care of the girls and don't fit to be a single parent.

We got into a huge argument after I told him I no longer will be welcoming him into my house because of his behavior. And he the reported me to CPS after I refused to let him into my house.

He claimed that I'm not taking good care of my girls needs/refusing to let them see their grandparents/being busy with work and other things I don't know about.

I had to deal with CPS once then after they did a surprise visit and thank goodness it went well although I was told to deal with some issues that are normal in every family.

I told my in-laws about what my brother in law did but didn't do anything. His wife was the one who told me eventually.


It's been over a month now. My inlaws are calling to tell me that i should let my brother see the girls after I told them that only them see my girls.

I refused to let him see the girls after what he did and the disrespect he shown but my in-laws are pressuring me saying these are their granddaughters and I have no right to act like this just out of spite.

Edit to say that the issues I'm dealing with are trying to balance my working hours with the time I spend with the girls. I have my mom either come over or take them to her house so I could pick them up after I get off work. Another thing is therapy and my girls are currently in therapy. I'm trying to take it slow but it's just so overwhelming and then to have to deal with my brother in law's behavior is just a lot for me and there isn't anything more I want than to spend time with my girls but I have to work since no one is willing to help with anything. I'm not the person who feels comfortable asking for help so I do all I can.

My brother in law says he wants to see the girls because it's been a while since he saw them and he misses them a lot but I don't want him around after what he did. I can't even look at him after this he made my grieve worse and I won't be able to forgive him soon.",2020-10-31 16:26:26,1364,19378,0.96,1,0,171,0,,2,5,5,4,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,

I responded by saying ""Oh, I use my husband's insurance. Our company is opposed to reproductive rights and only covers birth control when mandated by law"". He said something along the lines of ""I guess you need some type of control"" and we moved on to talking about the technical work that we were doing.

Later in the afternoon I got an email from my boss (M26) and he said that I shouldn't talk about details of my personal life with my co-worker and it made people uncomfortable.

My thought is that equal rights only happen when people are willing to make it a part of mainstream conversation. AITA for responding truthfully, but possibly with a bit TMI to a conversation started by my co worker, or should I have just kept it at ""Oh, I use my husband's insurance"" and not finished the sentence?

Edit: There was one other person in the room when I made the comment (also M50s). My boss didn't say who, but my belief is that it is the other person in the room who made the complaint, not the one I was actually talking to.

Edit 2: Wow, a lot more attention than I thought. First, a lot of questions about my work. I work for a hospital owned by a catholic conglomerate that employs about 125k people. I accepted the job when it was my only career related option for work, and it can be hard to leave. I wish I could work for someone with all the same ideals as I have, but then I would probably just be self employed. There are several people in my department who are openly non christian religions, and LGBTQ+. Just because it is a catholic organization does not mean it directly reflects the views of many of the employees. 

I spoke with my boss today. He was promoted from being my co-worker about a month ago and is still semi transitioning into his first management job. He apologized for his email without discussing with me and I apologized for my combative tone in the work place. He mentioned that our company policy includes harassments to include conversations that make people uncomfortable when they are within ear shot even if they are not directed at them (which confirmed my suspicion) but also conceded that what I said would not be considered harassment. I apologized for taking such a combative stance and said I will try to be more cognizant of my tone and audience in the future. He said that he never made an official statement to HR and was addressing this as a disagreement between coworkers. I also believe my other coworker's statement was a sort of ""clumsy agreement"" with me as I saw in the comments, not an attack at me, so I did not mention it. I have a summary of our conversation in email and saved. I doubt he handled it the best or most officially, but in the interest of an amicable work place, I have left it at that, have my documentation, and don't intend to follow it any further on my end.",2020-11-10 00:10:37,811,13345,0.96,6,4,196,2,,6,4,4,2,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We never got along. It took a turn for the awful when I was 9. My stepmom and dad wanted my stepmom to adopt me. I said no. They didn't listen and tried to push ahead with it, even going so far as planning a party to celebrate the approval of the adoption before anything was official. So they had everyone waiting at our house for when we got back from court with the go ahead. But I said I didn't want to be adopted to the judge and the judge respected that. My stepmom, dad and stepmom's sister all claim I humiliated her and made it awkward for everyone. The alternative, though, was to go ahead with an adoption I did not want and that was never going to happen.

Ever since my stepmoms sister has claimed I denied her sister the chance to be a mom. Honestly I usually respond sarcastically to it and brush it off but we do not like each other. She has claimed I'm so ungrateful when her sister has done so much for me and I could have done one thing to make her life by allowing her to adopt me and become a mom officially. I have told her it's none of her business, that she has no right to comment on my life. She doesn't like that. She believes she has a right because it's her sister I'm hurting with my rejection.

Once, about five years ago, I told her if she thought bullying me about it would make me love her sister or appreciate her then she was wrong. I told her it was annoying af.

Even though I cut her out after I was no longer living with my dad and stepmom she still tried to pester me about it. During lockdown she really got into it. She told me I was a bitch, I was acting like a brat, that I had no heart and all this other stuff. I told her to stop. I even said that she was acting more like a brat than I was by continuing the fight when I had made my position clear. It's not just her either. My stepmom is still doing what she can to get me to change my mind. It's just out of the two of them her sister is the more annoying and the outright bully.

So in August I kind of snapped and told my stepmom to call off her attack dog because she was crossing into the territory of being a stalker. This enraged the three of them (my dad, stepmom and her sister). They said I had no right to talk about her like that, said it was disgusting and I needed to apologize.

I don't think what I said was untrue. She does act like an attack dog. She's like Mr. Burns from The Simpsons releasing the hounds. But do you think what I said was a particularly AH move?

He’s not a snob, but recently he’s become a bit preachy about how it’s better to be an entrepreneur than an employee. 

We’ve talked about it several times before. I’ve been working for a financial company for 9 years, and he always asks me about when I would put up my own business. I told him that I enjoy my current job because I get paid alright, have a great time with my coworkers and learn many things from my clients. J said that I’m wasting my time working for a company that pays me so little compared to what I could earn if were a business owner. I told him that I do have plans of having my own business someday, but that requires a large amount of capital and is a huge risk that I’m not yet comfortable taking. He said that I’ve been an employee for 9 years, so “If not now, when?” and that you can only get the reward if you take the risk. 

I usually try to brush things off because I know that J has good intentions, he’s just a little out of touch with how hard it can be to put up your own business and be successful at it, since his dad’s businesses have been there all his life. But the other day he was telling me about one of his cousins who asked for advice on college majors. He told me that he told his cousin to go for a business degree, work for two years to get some experience and then have his own business, just like J said he did. He also told his cousin to remember to aspire for greater things and not be satisfied with being an employee forever.

I was a bit irked about the last part and told him that hey, there’s nothing wrong with being an employee ‘forever’ and not everyone is cut to or wants to be a business owner. He said yes, there’s nothing wrong with being an employee forever, but if you’re smart or have any ambition, you would want to have your own business instead of working for someone else your whole life.

I told J that if he thinks that being a business owner is the best way to succeed financially, then why hasn’t he put up his own business? He said that he does have his own business, referring to the construction firm his dad founded which he now manages, and he doesn’t have to put up a new one since his family already has one in place. I asked how it’s his if he isn’t the registered owner, needs approval from his dad for all major decisions, and doesn’t control the company’s income. I said that he’s basically an employee who happens to be related to the owner and the monthly allowance he gets for running the business is his salary.

So we all have cubicles with high walls that are textured where you can hang things. I suck at decor. While some coworkers including this lady kept their spaces looking like hotel rooms or whatever, mine wasn't bad but it was busy. It was set up so I could find everything I needed for work.

Well one day I come into work and all my papers are things were gone. I look in my cabinets and everything is neatly tucked away. I was a little taken aback and offended. I get to work an hour early so I immediately start searching for everything and putting everything back.

While im looking someone who is higher up, like an assistant manager walks by...whats strange is
1. Shes early too
2. She was walking all the way on my side of the floor where her desk is many rows from mine

So i really think she was there because she saw something after i left the night before
She asks me whats wrong. I tell her someone moved all my stuff. She then tells me to write the director about it.

So i write the email.

Remember, management APPROACHED me. I didn't go running to them.

I proceed to work. The lady comes in and doesn't say anything to me. At the end of the day I look in her cubicle and its cleaned out.

Now people are saying i got her fired. She talked to another coworker claiming she was only trying to help. Keep in mind i never asked her to clean my desk and she never asked me to clean my own desk either. Management is always putting out emails about cleanliness. People eat and leave food for days. When the director called me into her office she made a point of telling me my desk was fine. She said the situation had been handled. I never asked for this lady to be fired. I also had no idea who did it. People saw her.

Nows she fired and people blame me. AITA?

also..this lady wasnt a very good employee overall. She argued with customers and management a lot. She had the rules changed regarding cell phones because she kept FaceTiming her kids while at her desk.

Edit for clarity:
The assistant manager approached me and asked me to write an email about what happened to my desk. 

At the time of writing the email, I didn't know who had tampered with my things and no one told me. Actually no one told me she cleaned my desk, either.  I put two and two together on the spot because she sat right next to me and would have looked at my desk everyday.

This lady was annoying in other ways. I have an earlier schedule than her and i remember her coming in and basically forcing me to say good mornings to her even while i was talking to a customer.

It was confirmed she was the culprit when other coworkers complained to me and told me the lady said she was only trying to help.

I wasnt concerned about sensitive information on the desk but the job requires knowing a lot of information and she pulled all of my resources i used often during the day.",2020-11-10 01:28:28,775,14049,0.96,1,0,281,0,,,4,,1,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of my favorite desserts is brownies. I started with a very basic brownie recipe, but slowly I’ve made it more and more elaborate to achieve ultimate chocolate fudge status. 

I do not really bake with anyone else in mind. I just like trying recipes. Most of the time it’s a treat everyone can enjoy, but sometimes one of my three family members won’t like what I made.

At some point along the way, I watched a 100-hour brownie recipe and got the idea to start adding decaf coffee (I can’t do caffeine for other reasons). I tried it, it was delicious, and my mother and brother absolutely loved it. My father didn’t know what it was and ate them too, but when I revealed my “secret ingredient” was coffee, he got really upset. 

Ever since then, every time I make brownies he asks me to take the coffee out. I tell him no because it’s my recipe (that’s the part where I might be a total AH—I’m kind of stubborn about it). It’s not like it stops him from eating them. He ate 1/2 of a 9” pan in less than 24 hours last time (with coffee). 

Last night my college quarter ended, so I specifically made MYSELF a pan of brownies in celebration. Of course, everyone was welcome to share my celebration. 

For some reason, that particular night my dad simply got absolutely ticked that I wanted to add coffee—a little more of it, actually, and some dark chocolate, since that’s really what I’ve wanted to do. I tried to reason out that these were brownies for me really, but he just got more and more angry (I want to say whiny, but that feels mean). 

I added extra coffee anyway and baked them. Pure chocolate heaven! Best brownies yet. Denser than a black hole. Delicious. 

This morning he was very upset because he tasted the coffee and told me he was hurt. He then took 3 brownies from the pan and returned to his office (I’m not shoving them down his throat..?). 

Someone told me to just separate the batter into 2 bowls and bake them with and without coffee, but I usually can’t afford to double the recipe and I don’t have half pans. I also don’t want to end up in my mom’s conundrum—when she cooks, she almost always has to prepare two separate dinners (one for the rest of us, one for my dad without spices/onions/‘weird sauce’ and usually more centered around cheese/Taco Bell fire sauce/tortillas. Basically everything is a burrito). My brother and I help her out with cutting and prepping dinner since we’ve both gotten into cooking (and helped her get over her fear of us holding knives—thanks Food Network!). Still, though, it’s tedious to make a Bland and Good variations of a dish every time. Also doubles the leftover containers. 

AITA for adding coffee to my brownies knowing that my Dad (1 of 3 other people in my house) hates coffee?

This in particular is about one of my daughters (9f), I will call her Zoey as it starts with the same letter as her real name.

Zoey just entered 4th grade, she's going to school in person this year. Well one girl(I'll call her Cat) has been picking on Zoey a lot. I'm not one of those moms who makes a huge fuss over evrey little squabble. Cat has picked on Zoey for being adopted, being asian and started rumors that she has the virus. Every time Zoey tries to tell her teacher, her teacher either brushes it off as a ""conflict"" or says that Cat is dealing with a lot and not to mind her even though that is very hard for Zoey.

I have learned with one of my older kids to document every incident of bullying that happens to my child, I just write down the date and what they say happened in a notebook. It usually turns out to be nothing.

I have done this for what Zoey has said about Cat. Well last week was the final straw. I got called by the nurse that Zoey had fallen out of a tree at recess and hurt her arm and she had to go to urgent care. I picked her up as soon as I could. When we got in the car she said what really happened was Cat told her if she climbed up the tree she would let her sit on the class bean bag or something like that. When Zoey did it Cat began shaking the other end of it. When Zoey fell out of the tree Cat ran away. When her teacher got there she tried to tell him what happened but he scolded her for climbing up there (granted he didn't know how bad it was) and took her to the nurse.

Her wrist was broken because I guess she tried to catch herself from falling and ended up twisting it backwards. After she was home with my husband I marched into that school p\*ssed off. I ended up having a meeting with the guidance counselor and her teacher. Her teacher kept trying to call it a fight or conflict(giving them equal blame basically) or saying that she shouldn't have climbed the tree in the first place. Then he said that in the beginning of the year Cats parents told him that her grandma died over the summer so cut her a little slack.

I said I didn't care and she should still be punished. He seemed shocked that I said I didn't care. We has all this week off so I've taken a little time to cool off and now I'm not sure if I'm TA for saying that. AITA?

Last Friday at my rehearsal dinner, which wasn’t even really a rehearsal dinner, just my family and my in laws getting dinner together after pre wedding preparation (girls getting their nails done, men getting beards trimmed and haircuts etc) my sister asked my parents to go outside with her and apparently told them she was pregnant and planned on getting an abortion. 

I could tell they were noticeably upset when they came back, but that was common after conversations with my sister, because she was a little bit of a wild card.

The following day, my wedding day my mom and sister were very distant and whispering to each other throughout my getting ready, and also spent most of my reception doing the same thing, just this time with my dad. My father missed our father daughter dance and none of my family made a toast or any sort of acknowledgment really that I had gotten married. 

I waited until the end of the reception and asked them what was up? My sister told me she was pregnant and getting an abortion on the 20th.

I responded negatively, and got angry that she told our parents this at my wedding, and then got angry at my parents for ignoring me my whole wedding, missing our dance and not getting any photos together. I got my husband and we left, and I got calls and texts saying I was being incredibly selfish and that my sister needed their support. 

Aita?


Edit: I don’t want any prolifers coming to message me about my sisters getting an abortion. I am pro choice and 100% support her. I am upset over her choice to tell our family at my wedding. Not upset over her making a decision for her own body.

Even when she went into a much better college, I got my info sent to an important architectural office by one of my teachers, they contacted me and set an interview. I knew I shouldn't have said anything, but I was so, so proud that I called my parents to let them know, they acted happy for me smooched all the info and when I was done, they told me to let my sister go instead of me and that I could get something else I said obviously no and they tried to guilt-trip me by saying that I already stole her career and that I couldn't do the same with her job, I just snorted and hanged up.

I thought that they would drop it but when I presented to my interview they told me that (myname) had already come, broke some expensive shit and threatened to sue them for sexual harassment while they dragged her to the exit, I was confused because I didn't do any of that and showed them my ID, my papers and the recommendation letter from my teacher, it turned out that my sister was the one who came to the interview and when they didn't let her pass because my appointment was later she went bat-shit crazy and ran when they were calling the police, I was so ashamed and enraged that I gave them her whole info and they sent a police officer to our house to get her arrested for property damage and fraud, my parents obviously helped her out and when she got out of jail my parents demanded an apology, I just said ''play stupid games and win stupid prizes'', my parents kicked me out because I got her arrested and made fun of her, I moved with my brother and got the job.

I (21F) got pregnant at the age of 16 by a 18 year old. 

The biological father of my child (Dave) didn't want any responsibility of the child and ended up signing his parental rights away. 

My parents kicked me out when they found out I was pregnant and I had to go through my pregnancy all alone in not very great conditions. I asked Dave for some financial help which he refused even though he comes from a well off family.

Recently, Dave contacted me and showed interest in actually meeting my son which I refused as he doesn't live in the same country. His life is in shambles and he is still not sure if he wants to dedicate his whole life to my son. He just wants my son to know that he is his father.

My son and I don't have any other family other than each other and I don't wish for him to actually get connected with him and for him to then decide that he is still not ready. 

He legally can not do anything but now he calls me everyday and sends me case study of peoples experience growing up without a father.

AITA for not allowing my son's biological father to meet him?

Update:- Thanks to everyone who commented and I am sorry I could not go through every comment.

I have decided to not let Dave in my son's life at this present moment but when my child grows old enough to actually make the decision, he can decided if he wants to meet Dave or not.

Some people pointed out how my child may think I am an asshole when he grows up and to be honest if me being an asshole provides him a stable and great childhood. I don't mind being an asshole at all

So I’ve got two nieces currently in a private elementary school. I’ve been paying for their school tuition since they started school, roughly a few thousand a year, because I’m a single woman without kids or dependents and I’m happy to support them. My younger sister (their mom) has been happy to let me pay because their public school district is fairly bad.

Anyways, the kids will be moving into middle school next year which means tuition will increase by half, then another half by the time they’re in high school. My sister now wants me to wire that tuition money directly into her accounts, so that she can pay the school herself.

I don’t feel comfortable with this because I’m currently paying the school through a special portal that lets non-parents/guardians pay tuition directly to the school, and we get individual confirmation on where the money goes. It’s secure, easy, and transparent for my own financial records too. 

I love my sister but she has been destructively financially irresponsible in the past and the large sum that will be their tuitions in middle/high school is a LOT to transfer to one person at a time. Also, she recently started dating a somewhat sketchy man who heavily pushes her to demand this from me, so I am just paranoid as heck but I’m not sure if I’m overreacting. 

So now we’re fighting over this, because I said I’d prefer to keep using the portal, and my sister thinks I’m insulting her rights as a mother to oversee her kids’ finances. I’m feeling deeply conflicted on how I should approach this. Sure it’s my money, but it’s also her kids. 

AITA if I refuse to wire her money directly instead opting to pay the schools myself? It’s caused a big rift and I’m trying to respect everyone’s boundaries at the same time.",2020-11-25 03:49:00,532,2604,0.98,0,0,338,0,,3,,2,3,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sandy has the exclusive right to parent my uncle’s kids without question, but if my uncle even asks Amy to sit down for dinner she goes crying to her mom and my uncle is getting lectured on boundaries, how she’s not his kid. Amy is a mini Sandy, full of herself and has to insert herself in everything. First month they were dating we did family pictures. Nobody knew who Sandy or Amy were when they showed up for the pictures. We politely asked them if we could get just family pictures first. My grandma just wanted pictures with her kids and grandkids, not even my father was in the pictures and my mom and him have been together for almost 40 years. Sandy threw a fit claiming she was being alienated by my grandma and that my grandma is  just of her because my uncle is dating her not my grandma (what??? Why would my grandma want to date her son???). Then a couple of months later Sandy starts showing up almost everywhere my grandma went (she lived alone in a different state for the first few months of quarantine)! Grandma had to go get groceries at Costco? Sandy was there “thinking about applying for a membership”. My grandma had to go to the pharmacy? Oh what a coincidence, “the other pharmacy didn’t have my medication” so she had to go to the one 35 minutes away that’s in my grandmas town. Anyway, onto Thanksgiving Day’s events. All of us decided to hop on Zoom so we could have thanksgiving dinner “together” when my uncle started getting tons of phone calls and texts causing him to step away. When he came back he said “sorry that was Sandy and Amy, they’re upset they weren’t invited so I sent them the link.” Now, we did this for 2 reasons, 1) they’re both self centered, and 2) Sandy is still married and living with her husband who also joins the call. First we hear Amy crying and screaming in the background like a 2 year old having a tantrum, then Sandy starts screaming at us calling us selfish bastards, and then to top it off HER HUSBAND starts laying into us about disrespecting “his wife”. Before you ask, no, they’re apparently not in an open relationship; Sandy and her husband allegedly just want the benefits. Anyway, my grandma, being the savage little old lady she is, pipes up saying “See? This is why nobody here like you. This is why we do everything without you. This is my I’m so glad that you and that rabid kid of yours aren’t invited to my granddaughter’s wedding.” From there all hell broke loose and there was even more crying from Amy, and Sandy started to cry saying that we’re “targeting her” and so on.

Dad's family came from old-money, he is filthy-rich(close to billions). Growing up he spoiled me, Amanda, and my two other brothers a lot, we came from a VERY privileged family.

One thing about dad is that he really loves weddings, he is a bit of a romantic and very traditional in that sense, and growing up we always remember him saying that ''he couldn't wait for the day to walk down his little princesses down the aisle'' it was a pretty huge thing for him. When my older brother(41M) got married on his one year anniversary in 2011 dad gave him a house as a wedding anniversary gift, it was a pretty huge and expensive house (close to $3million) and started a tradition in our family, my younger brother got the same thing. When I got married in 2018 my dad was really thrilled about the whole thing he gave me a blank check for the ceremony (my brothers got the same deal) and it was beautiful, he walked me down the aisle and was really emotional about it, one of the few times I saw him cry, I receive a house in my first wedding anniversary.

When Amy got engaged dad was really excited too, one week before the wedding Amy drops the bomb, she was going to walk down the aisle alone, dad was really sad with this whole thing but she said that ''she wasn't anyone property to be given away'','' that she was independent grown-ass woman''(true, she is more independent than I will ever be), ''that this was a misogynistic tradition that she wouldn't want to participate in'', despite dad begging her she didn't kneel, dad paid for the whole wedding, she offered him the traditional father-daughter dance but he refused his logic was that ''if you don't want me to act like your father in a traditional way, I won't''. 

Skip to one year after the wedding, dad didn't give Amy anything, when she confronted him about it he gave her a receipt for a donation of $3 million to the National Women's Law Center (Amy is a lawyer) in her name she tried to argue but couldn't really say anything. When my and my other brother's kids were born dad started a college fund for each one of them (it's supposed to achieve $2million when they reach 18), last week Amy discovered about the funds and ask dad about it (she has 3 kids 7F,5F,2F), apparently dad has been giving the money that was supposed to go her daughter's to the NWLC to help other ''independent grown-ass woman like her''. Amy is furious at our dad and they currently not speaking right now, she asked us (me and our other brothers) to share our kid's college fund with her kids because ''dad is a mean cunt and is punishing her kids'', we refused because it's not like our kids are getting the money that was supposed to go to her kids, she is giving us the silent treatment since them.

I(20F) was temporarily living with my mother, stepfather and stepsister(14). Me and stepsister were never close, she hates me and my mother, thinking that my mother ""stole"" her father away after her own mother passed. It has been that way for 4 years already and while she is in slightly better terms with my mother, she still constantly tries to disturb me because I am not as tolerant as my mother. As for my stepfather, he is quite okay but he would pretend to ignore me in front of my stepsister sometimes because she would throw a fuss about it.

I was supposed to move to a rather far place to work and study. My father arranged for me to move in after renovations are done, bringing my dog with me. When I first brought my dog to my mother's a few months ago my stepsister seemingly fell in love with him. At first it was just me taking care of him, then we took turns taking him out, for a while I even thought that we could have gotten along better because we both love the dog. 

And one day my sister returned without my dog and announced that she had given him away, just to spite me. She got what she wanted and no matter how nicely or nastily I asked her she wouldn't tell me where she took him. I complained it to my mother and stepfather but they couldn't get her to talk either, she had this attitude of ""try me"" whenever she gets stubborn. I was to move in 2 days and I guess she wanted to keep my dog for herself or make me miss my cross country train.

I know it is despicable, but I was worried for my pup and whatever she could have done with him. I sneaked into her room when she was not looking and took her mother's ash urn, I know this was precious to her, precious enough to be used to make her talk. I hid the urn somewhere she would never find.

Sure enough, my stepsister lost it completely when she realized what I did, and similarly I'd never talk no matter what my mother or stepfather say. After all those screaming and crying she finally gave in and admitted that she brought him to her friend's. After taking the trip and passing my dog back to me, she demanded to have the urn back but I did not tell her until my day of departure, in case she wanted to pull some sick prank again.

Everybody I know of, including my own father, thinks that I took it too far. While in the end nothing really bad happened, I did it in the worst way possible(quoted by my mother, who did nothing to help either). It was my stepsister who started it, she knew how important my pup is to me and she tried to take him away from me, so I used similar way to make her return him and it worked. I didn't do it out of spite, just making use of what I could to get my dog back.

His girlfriend is pregnant and because they are in a rough patch, both of them also dropped out of school. I’ve been helping them out with money.

For the most part I like his girlfriend well enough, but she’s been a bit overbearing during this pregnancy. Not that I really blame her.

Today they came over and his girlfriend decided to give a list of “dos and don’ts” to my husband and I if we wanted to have contact with their child. The list was mostly reasonable (have vaccines, don’t swear around the baby, handle baby with care, don’t show up unannounced, no sexism/racism and any sort of -ism around the kid etc). Some of them were a bit overbearing (when the baby is older no tickling or sweets, no cartoons, no baby talk etc). I took issues with this for two reasons:

1) It seems insulting and condescending. Some of the items on the list are things we would never do (like the racism and sexism one struck me as really odd). We’re also not anti-vaxxers. It feels like she was pretty much assuming the worst of us (ex of course we wouldn’t swear like a sailor around a child!). And we always call before we visit, they show up unannounced more than us!

2) Some of the items on the list are extreme. I understand that these are her rules and how she plans to raise the baby, but the idea that I would lose access to my grandchild because I baked cookies with them is extreme and I don’t want to walk on eggshells or go through the hurt of losing my grandchild. Especially since I feel like it’s the grandparents job to spoil the child (within reason of course)

(To clarify, I understand how these requirements could be necessary - if we weren’t suited to be around children I would understand).

So in response I said fine, but now here’s a list of requirements to receive financial support. In the past we’ve always trusted them and given them a monthly allowance. As long as we didn’t think they were deceiving us or blowing money or asking for even more we let them do what they will with the money. So I added the stipulations like wanting to see their budget to ensure they didn’t 1) eat out 2) buy unnecessary clothing 3) didn’t go to hair salons instead of barbers 4) had to spend a certain amount on the baby 5) didn’t buy hobby-related stuff etc.  And finally, financial support would be lost if we were to be denied access to the baby. There were more stipulations but I’m sure you get the point.

I made this list and gave it to both of them in exchange for the list of the baby requirements. Both my son and his girlfriend were upset with this. I said that previously I had trusted them, but since you didn’t trust us we wouldn’t trust them. I also told them how disrespectful I thought they were for giving me a list when they rely on my husband and I for support.

His girlfriend said I wouldn’t be able to see the baby. I told them they could leave. My husband and I are both conflicted over this and I’m wondering if I overreacted. AITA?

Edit: To all of you who are sending me messages hoping I die and saying you’re happy I’ll never see my grandchild, or calling my DIL a sl*t for having an accidental pregnancy, why don’t you say those things in the comments instead of hiding in my inbox?

Edit2: I thought I would add a mini update. It looks like the very top reply is NTA but there is a great deal of ESH and YTA’s. I can acknowledge that a discussion would have been a better approach, however at the time I felt like I had just been slapped in the face which is why I reacted the way I did.

I have had some time to reflect, but right now I am still more upset that in response to conflict, my DIL and son both reacted by saying I will never see their child. I can possibly forgive them for the list as being overly cautious parents, but I’m not going to tolerate them threatening no contact over any conflict or using it as a control method. It would be too hurtful for myself. Some of you have accused my list as being petty, which maybe it was, but truly I was being defensive more than anything. I will not leave myself open to emotional manipulation, and I plan on making that very clear to my DIL.

I do plan on talking to my son and DIL and going from there. I’m just going to wait though, as I want to be in a clear frame of mind and right now I am still very hurt and angry at them. Hopefully in a day or two we will be in a position where we can all apologize to each other and move on.

Now I am from a big city which is where most of my old friends and family still live and as a result on a monthly basis I get at least one person asking me if they can ""come to see me"" which is a different way of saying they need a vacation and want to stay with me. I'll be short, mostly my answer is a simple no especially if I need to travel during their stay as I don't trust anyone but my dad and girlfriend to be alone at my house. However on occasion I say yes, especially if I want to see someone.

So my college friend ""Brian"" contacted me asking if he and a buddy could vacation at my place for a week as they really need a break and he wanted to hang out like the old days. I agreed, I haven't seen Brian in ages but still actively talk to him, so why not? And before some of you start about covid, you can have people over here and there hasn't been an outbreak here or in the city they live in months.

So we agree when he will arrive and he'd bring another of his college buddies. Well the day comes, I prepare the guest rooms and an hour before they are supposed to arrive Brian messages me that something came up and he can't come, I figure okay then, but I get a message a few minutes later that he got another one of his buddies to take his place. I told him I was not comfortable letting 2 strangers stay and didn't get a reply.

At any rate roughly an hour and a half later my doorbell rings and 2 dudes stand there with their luggage. I say hi and ask them what they want and they say they are staying here, I say they ain't and tell them to bugger off, they ask me if they can at least stay the night, I say no. Brian calls me later going out of his mind with anger claiming I am a giant AH and that his friends had to drive for hours only to drive back home when he told me they would be coming. I told him to go F himself.

His friends probably at least I assume knew nothing about this so I feel terrible for them.",2020-11-19 18:31:51,486,7556,0.97,5,0,233,3,,2,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My older sister Angie and me are inseparable.When we were younger we'd play together all the time,tell eachother our secret's,if one of us got in trouble the other would take the blame,we would do eachother's homework's and she's partly the reason why I've got an A+ on my math exam.

She is married to a man named Liam,and together they have five children.Angie is working all the time and because Liam does not have a job he is left home to take care of their children.I mainly visit them to help Liam,and in one of those particular visit's of mine he had asked to speak to me in private.

That's when he had admit to me that he was gay,and that he has been going around in gay bar's.He told me how he was only staying with Angie because of the children and that otherwise he would've left her and wen't on to be with another man.I was shocked and speachless,but I've told him that I wouldn't tell anyone and he called me the best brother-in-law ever.

But in the end,question's of infedelity came since he did tell me he was going out in gay bar's and there was a possibilty he was sleeping with other men so I decided it was best if I told Angie about his homosexuality after all.

When I told Angie about it,she and Liam had a full blown fight.She kicked him out of their house and is currently filing for a divorce.I've tried messaging Liam but he keep's telling me how I violated his privacy and that I was a huge dickhead for telling Angie but Angie thanked me for it and told me that it was a good thing I didn't hide anything from her.

Angie and I still have the same relationship as we did before,but I still think that I might be the asshole in this situation.

We went to a fancy Italian restaurant together.
I am Italian. My family lives in Italy, and I lived there for more than twenty years before moving to the US.
While my boyfriend and his friends all ordered wine and ""fancy meals"", I opted for a soft drink and some roasted chicken with fries.
I've always been picky, and I'm not a fan of the american version of Italian food. I seldom eat italian here in the US, and that dinner was not an exception. 
One of my boyfriend's friend, J., made a joke about me being ""clearly not fancy enough to enjoy real Italian"".
I replied that I like my italian food in Italy.
I think J. understood something like ""I once went in Italy and liked the food there"", and proceeded talking about his two weeks in Europe 5 years ago.
I said nothing about it for the rest of the meal. While we were eating dessert, one of the other friends asked me where I was from, since she noted my accent was a bit weird. I replied Italy.
J. instantly went silent. He barely looked at me when we said our goodbyes.
Later my boyfriend told me I was kind of a dick, but he's a bastard and probably enjoyed the look on J.'s face. One of his friends later messaged him to let him know that I'm an AH for embarrassing J.

Edit: thank you redditors! Some of you actually suggested me to rethink about my boyfriend's part in this, so I talked to him and he apologized for making things awkward. He also said we are not going to meet J. and the other friends anymore if I don't feel comfortable with it.
We also made a bet that he'll find an Italian-American meal that I enjoy as much as the original.",2020-11-15 20:24:20,573,9904,0.97,4,5,273,1,,,3,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My dad suffered from sciatica that put him out of work for a while. so we all had to stay home to take care of him. During that period of time, I didn't do anything except work, and come home. So I figured, considering that I'm the only employed person in the house, maybe I deserve a little privacy when my dad didn't need to be attended to. Boy was I wrong. My mother and I got into a big argument over the fact that my bedroom door was closed. She asked me why I had closed the door. And I told her that I just wanted some privacy. My mother replied to this by saying ""You don't have any privacy in this house."" At this point I'm annoyed. And I said. ""Then this isn't a house, it's a prison."" My mother looked stunned at this. And then she asked, what made me say that. I told her that not having any privacy is the same thing correctional officers tell inmates in prison. And that if she didn't believe me, that she should ask Dad, since he used to be a correctional officer. She just looked at me and said...""Well if you don't like it, you can pack up your stuff and go.. And that's exactly what I did...It took a while (little less than a year.) but my dad's sciatica had healed up quite a bit. And he was able to walk around on his own to do a lot of things. By this time I already had my own place. My mother was upset that I didn't tell her that I was saving money for my own place. But eventually her love changed and she wound up being happy that I was finally out on my own. Fast forward a few months. My mother calls me and tells me that their ssi got cut off..so they needed a place to stay until they get their benefits back, I immediately tell them to come over. We might not have agreed on a lot of things but I didn't wanna see them homeless.For about a month or so, things were working out fine. My dads sciatica was healed enough to where he was able to get a job as a security guard. Then things went a little sour. One day I come home and I notice that some things weren't the same as they were when I left earlier that day. For clarification, here's what I saw. 1)I accumulated a good selection of horror movies(Halloween, Friday the 13th. Texas chainsaw. Etc) those were gone. 2)my bedroom door was closed when I left, and now it's open. I asked my mom what Happened to my movies, and why my bedroom door was open. Here's what she said.""I told you we don't close doors, and horror movies are a gateway for demons. So I got rid of them..""  I then replied by saying that when I was living in their house, I had to go by their rules. Now they're living in MY house, and and theyre still trying to make the rules. And they can't do that when they're in someone's else's house. My mother said that I'm always supposed to obey her no matter how old I get. She also said that what I said was disrespectful and rude.

It's her main source of income and she really pushes her business and particularly pet portraits as gifts, especially around the holidays. She uses a tan, textured paper she loves and draws with colored pencils. I once asked if she ever thought about using a different kind of paper for drawings for those that don't really care for the look of it and she said absolutely not, because she loves drawing on the paper she has. 

Between us I do not like the look of her art at all, but I have never and will never tell her this. I hate the paper she uses (it gives the drawings a weird textured look because of the way the paper is made) and I am not a fan of the light, faded colors she uses. It's not my style and as talented as she is I have never bought art from her because I don't care for it and it doesn't appeal to my own art tastes. 

My problem is that I recently purchased a commission from another artist friend. He art style is more modern, she uses copic markers and a clean, bright paper. Her style is bold, bright, and fun. I had her do a modern piece of my dog that is a gift for my fiancé. I posted it on social media when I got the finished piece and gave it to him and tagged the artist and thanked her for the beautiful artwork. 

My other artist friend saw and confronted me and asked why I didn't use her. I explained that I find her extremely talented, but her art style and her medium are not my taste or my own personal style.

She lost it. Called me names. Told me I am unsupportive. Said I would rather give strangers money than her (the artist I used was another friend but she did not know that.) She is now badmouthing me to mutual friends and passive aggressively posting about me on social media.

Nobody besides her family (and my sister, who found out on her own) really knows this, and she wants to keep it that way.

Anyway, we both wanted to have kids young so we adopted our little girl before the pandemic started. Because of everything that's been going on, my parents didn't really get to meet her until last week, and my sister and her husband were also there.

My parents are very conservative, and they've been a bit disappointed about the fact that we adopted--nothing really explicit, but just subtle things. After they met our daughter, though, they melted a little (because how could you not?) but they still wanted to know why we adopted. I felt a bit clever saying ""fertility issues,"" because we *do* have fertility issues, just not the kind my parents probably thought.

My sister didn't say anything at the time, but she let loose on me later. I forgot that she has fertility issues, and she started yelling at me saying that she's been spending ten of thousands of dollars on in-vitro, how depressed it's made her, how her marriage is on the rocks, and how she's traumatized from her miscarriages (I didn't know she had any). She told me that she trusted me with that and that I'm immature. I told her that we technically *do* have fertility issues, and she said it's different because we ""chose"" to have ours and we knew what we were getting into. She said that it wasn't our issue to appropriate. All the women I dated before my wife were cis but I didn't fall in love with any of them. I don't think I ""chose"" to fall in love with her, so that made me pretty upset.

I wouldn't have felt like I was in the wrong until my sister told me that I could have just said that I felt like it would be better for the world to adopt. I still think it would have been met with a lot of suspicion and criticism from my parents, but that would have been the easiest way to avoid anybody getting hurt, and now I've built this unnecessary rift between my sister and I. My wife says that we *do* have fertility issues and she feels bad for my sister because of everything she's going through, but ultimately we have nothing to apologize for because we told the truth.

I don't know what to think about all this. AITA?",2020-11-17 17:01:48,639,5363,0.94,6,39,216,1,,,3,3,3,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We let her get out all of her excitement, but didn't really encourage it. She keeps doing this weird thing where she refers to the baby as ""her"" baby. If I can be honest... I'm sure it'll change as time goes on, but I find the whole thing rather boring. Congrats, someone who I just so happened to be married to shot a load in me without a condom, and now I'm knocked up. It's really not that exciting or interesting, and I cannot relate to women who never shut up about it. It's like the only thing anyone wants to talk to me about.

ANYWAY. MIL was over a few weeks ago and started talking names. She told me to give her a list and she'd go through and let us know which ones she liked or didn't like.

I asked her why that was necessary, and she said ""Oh, you know! Just making sure we're on the same page.""

I asked for clarification to that, why we'd need to be on the same page, and she started getting a bit cagey about it. Oh you know. Just one of those things. Gotta make sure everyone's on board with the name.""

At that point, I cleared my throat and said, very kindly but firmly, ""There's no reason for anyone else to be 'on board' with the names we've chosen.""

She got a bit upset at that and said ""Well it's my grandchild! My *baby!*""

I said ""No, she's not *your* baby. Grandchild, yes. But... you don't think you get 'a say' in anything involving her, do you? Like... you don't think you get any say in her name, how she's raised, what schools she goes to, how she dresses, any of it, right? You know you're not the parent here, right?""

Well, she blew up. Calling me ungrateful (For what? Bitch you aren't doing anything!), snobby, snooty, the whole shebang. I just got up and said I was bored with this conversation and went to the backyard to go read in the sun while she melted down to my husband about how I'm stealing all the joy from her and that don't I get that grandma is the most important role she'll ever play?

My husband told her to knock off the theatrics and go home, and now she's going all over social media playing up what a victim she is because, I guess now we're ""keeping her baby away"" (Which... isn't true? The little fucker still hasn't been born yet?). I've had so much pushback from family telling us we need to just get over it and learn to accept that Grandma's going to be around and that yeah, maybe she should get a say in some things, after all, it's her grandchild.

I'm at a loss here. Maybe this is some weird cultural thing (We're in the Southwest US, everyone is some bland mix of white, no religious stuff other than the usual fake Catholic (C&E) stuff.

AITA?

**EDIT:** Well, this was certainly a post. I'm glad I'm generally not the asshole. The sexist claims that I'm trying to be ""edgy"" and ""not like the other girls"" are honestly depressing. I didn't expect people to get so upset because a woman would dare not think having a baby is the most OMG sacred beautiful lovely thing or whatever. I hope those of you who think it's a ""not like the other girls"" thing can maybe get out there and explore what different women are actually like, and not just the ones in your immediate lives. Women come in all shapes and sizes, attitudes and personalities. Being one way is not a condemnation of how other women are. Being bored by childbirth and all of that isn't a condemnation for those who think it's a big deal or a miracle. Swearing and being inappropriate being ""edgy"" or ""tryhard"" is such a very Reddit thing to say about a woman who doesn't behave the way you think she should. Some of you women need to really reach deep and explore the internalized misogyny.

Best of luck to everyone, and thanks for the kind words. ",2020-10-19 22:11:55,2566,17342,0.89,4,0,71,22,,10,6,5,12,,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

when i first found out i was pregnant H and i went out for coffee to discuss all things babies and pregnancy and it was lovely to be able to talk to someone about it who knew what i was going through and who already was my friend. while out for coffee we discussed baby names, I brought up my two top favourites, Delilah for a girl and Theodore for a boy. She brought up her favourites which were Asher and Ashleigh. I politely said that i thought that was a bad idea in twins because having such obviously matching names may make their struggle with identity worse, even if they’re boy girl twins. She agreed and said she’d think of other names. 

Fast forward to last night, she calls me to tell me she’s had the twins and that they’re perfectly healthy, but she hasn’t settled on names yet. I’m super excited for her because she had a difficult pregnancy and at one point we weren’t sure if the boy was going to make it.

My friend Kate is passive aggressive when she’s upset. She’s not upfront with me or my friend group and drops “hints” and then gets upset when we don’t get the memo. Even tho we always tell her to speak up in every argument 

For example: she never breaks up with a bf she just acts crappy when she’s tired of him and waits for him to break up and then calls him dumb for not taking the hint. She always says stuff like “it would be nice to have x” “x looks cool” instead of saying “i want x” and then gets mad when we don’t get her x. Those are a few examples.

My friends had a Friendsgiving on zoom last night. I couldn’t go bc I had a lot of hw and a quiz that night. Everyone seemed to understand Im the group chat.

Last other after the zoom party Kate texted me surprised that i didn’t make it. She told me that she thought I picked up her hints that she was upset that I couldn’t go and figured I would try to finish my work faster. I asked what hints. And she freakin said that the hints where her sending dry messages since she usually doesn’t do that.

I blew up and told her: did no one teach you to use your words? If you’re mad you say that you’re mad. Babies communicate better and all they do is cry. I’m not a fucking mind reader. You either tell me what’s wrong or move on. See what I’m doing rn? I’m feeling how I feel instead of dropping hints. You’re not the DaVinci code. Now if you’re still going to be passive aggressive and not upfront tell me right now so I could end this friendship bc I can’t take it anymore.

My friend group thinks I’m the AH. Because even tho I’m technically right(their words) I shouldnt have been so insulting and harsh. They also think my last sentence was an ultimatum which isn’t cool. And according to one friend Kate called them crying about me. Which made me feel like and AH too bc I’ve never already anyone cry.AITA? 

Edit: I apologized to her. I texted her this: Kate, what I said to you was not cool. I shouldn’t have let the stress get to me and i see that said some messed up things. I’m sorry for the way I spoke to you bc no one should be blown up at no matter how tired one is of any situation. Next time I’ll make sure to get my point across in a way that’s effective and helpful for all of us.

I wish I could’ve said it over the phone but she didn’t pick up after 3 calls. And although I texted her this i will also distance myself from her bc I don’t see her changing and don’t want to put myself in this situation again. Idk if I could just ditch her as a friend completely bc she’s in my friend group.

Right now I happen to have the little Reese’s peanut butter cups. Heather noticed my candy dish and said, “You know, I’m allergic to peanuts.” I said I was not aware of her peanut allergy but I did have some other kinds of candy in my dish without peanuts if she wanted any. She said, “You don’t seem to get it. I could die.” I said yes, I have heard that can happen sometimes. I said that at the time I purchased the candy for my dish she was not employed by our company yet and next time I would be sure not to buy candy with peanuts. She then said, “Don’t you think it’s insensitive to keep that death-inducing candy sitting on your desk? You’re not respecting my peanut allergy.” I said I did not think it was insensitive because all she needed to do was not take any of it. She told me I needed to “get rid” of my candy and I told her “no.” I said, “We have employer-sponsored health insurance. If you know you will die if you come in contact with something as common as peanuts, I suggest you get an eppi-pen.” She went to Human Resources and basically told them I was putting peanut butter candy on my desk to harass and bully her because of her peanut allergy. I got a lecture from HR and was directed to never bring anything containing peanuts into the office again. I definitely think she is an asshole, but I am not entirely sure about myself.
EDIT: A lot of people are talking about airborne peanut allergens. I don’t think it’s that kind of peanut allergy because she was standing right next to my candy dish the entire time she was arguing with me. Also she didn’t correct me when I said that as long as she didn’t eat any of the peanut candy it wouldn’t be a problem for her. Also when I talked with HR they did not say anything about an airborne peanut allergy. I know I wasn’t nice and I am not saying I was not an asshole. I do want to say if I thought she was in any actual danger I would remove the candy right away.
ONE MORE EDIT: I don’t know if it makes a difference, but my candy dish primarily had non-peanut candy. Kit-Kat, Milk Duds, Whoppers, Rollos, and then Reese’s cups. It all came together in the same bag like a Halloween candy mix. Then I added milk chocolate Dove candies (no nuts). We are literally talking about no more than three Reese’s cups in the candy dish. Not an entire dish full of Reese’s.
UPDATE: Today I went to the HR lady to discuss me being the only person instructed not to bring peanuts to the office. The HR lady said, “I owe you an apology. We should have done our due diligence before we said that, and we shouldn’t have singled you out. At this time we have no reason to limit anyone from bringing peanuts to the office.” I asked her, “What about Heather’s allergies?” She kind of rolled her eyes and said, “I really can’t talk about her private health information. All I can say at this time is that I haven’t seen any evidence that supports the need to limit any employee’s exposure to peanuts. Going by the evidence we have, Heather will be just fine and that’s all I can say about it.”",2020-11-24 21:25:54,587,2144,0.95,23,0,109,18,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now I haven't spoken to him in about 3 years and we have begun to build my son back up to the man he was before and we were having a small party for his birthday and somehow someone who didn't know the story asked about his brother and I said I don't know and they asked what he does and I said again I don't know and they started getting upset with me saying that its sad that a father doesn't know anything about his own son.  I told them that he made his decision and I'm not gonna disuse this any further. 

Honestly I have missed my son but I can't began to think of how much it would hurt 26 to have me disregard his feelings for those 2. 

So AITA

Edit: I apologize for my failure to communicate this effectively but the affair happened for about a year before my son found out and the divorce happened. 
This happened 3 years ago and they were those ages at the time of the blow up they are now 29m 27m and 23f. Exwife/wife is now 28 and was 25 at the time. 
They had been married for 4 years and my wife and sister loved her he was my wifes baby and the first one to get married and she would just adore any one that made one of her babies happy. When my wife died she took it as hard as any of us so I really thought of her as my daughter. 26 was alot like me he was brash and but hardworking but kinda unambitious. My wife loved that about him and they were always closer to each other then they were to me or the other kids, whereas I liked to hang out with the kids that behaved more like my wife my headstrong and highly ambitious son and daughter 24 and 20. They were my favorite children, they were the ones that I went to bat for when fun met funds. I know I shouldn't say this but they all know it i guess. Maybe thats what made 24 thnink that he could get away with anything with me. But I spent 26 years doing everything I could think to do to help my kids be good people. I hate that this situation ever happened but I do not support betrayal.


So I just got a phone call that I didn't expect. My oldest son just told me that he saw this post and wants to talk about what we should do going forward. We're going to talk after church and I'll see what he wants to do. I hope he's not mad at me for airing his business. I'm just so scared but I think this needs to happen. 

And thank you all for the comments and awards. I am truly sad and humbled but I have to say that maybe the reason that other parents don't do what I did is because it is so hard and I think easy is the normal way that people do thing.",2020-11-14 19:20:23,691,6795,0.97,11,1,137,7,,,4,5,2,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Title sounds horrible but hear me out please.

So, my 35F husband's 37M family recently moved to our town to live close to us and my brother in law who got married a few months ago.

My inlaws like to gather twice a month for dinner and they'd have me and my husband visit (3h drive) once a month. My mother in law wouldn't accept any excuses that I work and have kids to take care of. She always wants the family gathered at her house.

Last week. While we were visiting their new house. My husband made me spend x money for a gift that he didn't help with. Also had me carry boxes to help them move stuff into their house while my brother in law's new wife sat on the couch and was served with coffee and sweets.

He told them that he wanted to invite them over for dinner the next day and he didn't even consult with me first so I had to take the day off so I could prepare meals. I made the main dishes, appetizers, salad and pound cake.

They arrived at 7pm. Mother in law, brother in law's wife didn't move a finger, they were busy criticizing my table setting and giving “advice”.

I put dinner on the table and my mother in law started asking why I used x ingredient instead of x ingredient. Saying that she would've liked it. Then said that the salad was not necessary because no one liked this type of salad. My husband just agreed with her telling me why i didn't do it this way or that way. I was getting mad and lost my appetite. Mother in law said the pound cake was not complete and didn't look delicious. My husband told her that he wanted to get one from the bakery but I didn't allow him. The cake stayed the same while they ate what brother in law's wife brought and flattered her.

After they left. I told my husband that his mom was being rude and mean to me the whole time. That he should've stopped her instead of agreeing with her. He said that he didn't defend me because I was in the wrong and what I cooked was not so great and that I embarrassed him infront of his family after having them try my cooking for the first time..

I got mad at him and told him I will no longer invite his family for dinners and he didn't like that since he told his mom that we will regularly invite them for dinner. He called me too sensitive and that I should just focus on cooking what they like instead.

He thinks I'm overreacting but I'm so angry and feel like I been insulted and disrespected in my own house.",2020-10-23 18:11:36,1888,17994,0.96,0,0,160,0,,3,2,5,5,,15,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She got frustrated and put it in her recycling bin that was supposed to be collected this morning but I asked my husband if it's okay if I have it. My husband asked my SIL if I can have it? She said yes and good luck with that. My husband removed it from her recycling bin before it got picked up and gave it me.

 Anyways I looked on YouTube and there was a video that I followed were I just boil it in dish wash liquid and water it would come out and it worked  it looked good as new. My husband took a picture and showed his sister and she was so excited and said thank you!!!! She was planning to try that dish again and wants him to bring it back. I refused to give it back because she was going to throw it away and said I can have it. SIL is now angry and saying I am an asshole and should just buy my own because we have two salaries and she's a single mother. She is 50 years old but throwing the biggest fit. She didn't even buy that cooking pot, it was a gift from some guy she was dating. 

Should I return it and AITA?

*Update, I was overwhelmed with all the comments and didn't know that this would be  controversial and had so many replies. I used the clean Pot as a plant holder,  it was my first intentions. I didn't know it would clean so easily of course and I simply googled it when I got home. SIL is always on her phone Facebooking so she could of easily googled it too. She's annoyed that I used it as a plant holder, but I told her it would be in the landfill or recycling centre by now, at least it's being used.

We were hanging out recently and I mentioned to him that if he was looking for a gift, there was something that I really wanted. I showed him what it was and he said “if you want it, just go ahead a buy it”. I told him I’d rather have it as a gift, and if he wanted to get me something different, I’d rather have the gift from him since it would be more special coming from him. He said that buying me gifts was pointless since I would see the money leaving the account and know that he had bought it (we have a shared bank account). I told him it wasn’t pointless to me and I’d like to get a gift on Christmas regardless, and he said if I wanted a gift I could just buy one for myself. He hasn’t gotten me gifts in a couple years and I feel like he doesn’t care how much this hurts me.

I draft most of my designs, and the ones that I don’t I make sure to research to make sure I’m not somehow beading something with cultural significance, since it’s not my culture. 

However, I was recently talking to my friends about my beadwork, and they informed me that it was cultural appropriation. I avoid any kind of sacred motifs, nor do I make any claims to be native, and the only “profit” I get off of my work are bloody fingers and the satisfaction of making things. 

So, am I the asshole for this? I know there is a history of cultural appropriation in America concerning native Americans, and the absolute last thing I want to do is perpetuate any of that.

I (25F) share a house with three people. Ricky, Kira, and Paige (all 20s). Ricky and I are recent grads, and Kira and Paige are in grad school. They are also a lesbian couple.

Anyway, when we moved in we just furnished the house in some bare bones IKEA stuff. Paige mentioned wanting to put up some art, and I agreed, thinking it would just be a landscape painting or something.

But no — Paige apparently makes very not safe for work art, and she put it up in our living room. Highlights include a picture of a person licking a nipple and a fat stripper. Very weird stuff to be honest. 

I told Paige that dirty art could only be displayed in her room, and that stuff in the common area had to be appropriate for all ages. I used to have my elementary school age nieces over a lot, and I’ll start doing it again once the pandemic is over. I don’t want them to see super crude stuff.

Well, Paige was going to agree, but Kira freaked out and made it into a homophobic thing. I’m bisexual myself, and I tried to tell her that. Now nobody in the house is talking, and Ricky is mad at me too for causing drama.

AITA?

Edit to clarify: I’m totally fine with gay themed art (or any other art) as long as it’s appropriate for kids. Kira maintains that the art isn’t sexual, but a stripper and a literal tongue licking a boob is pretty sexual to most people. She also says that our apartment is an adult space and I just shouldn’t bring my nieces unless they can deal with it. 

Also, sorry for the no-context remark about the stripper being fat. Some commenters read it as ripping on fat people or saying they can’t be sexy — my bad.",2020-11-21 09:29:51,434,5698,0.97,6,6,199,3,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8 years ago Bob( then 26) married ""Beth""(19). They had twins right away so I gave him a glorified ""job"" that he's still doing. I gave Beth got an entry level position with a couple years later and she quickly worked her way up. She's indispensable now.  Three years ago I asked her to go to school to learn the technical side of the business. She's doing amazing and will even finish early.

Bob didn't want Beth to go to school, but I pressured and bribed to get him to accept. I offered an extra allowance and told him that she could help him run the company after I pass.

I might be TA because I lied. I have zero intention of giving him the company. Bluntly, he's incompetent.  I've been grooming Beth in the background to succeed me. I'm secretly planning to retire in the next 5-6 years after Beth is established.

Bob gave up his dream job to stay and work here. which I know is bad. But he was expecting me to fund his ""career"", so am I still the bad guy?

I (M27) met my now wife (F35) who was a single parent with three kids. She was 8 years older than me and we met when I came home. We started dating I met her kids and they seemed so sweet and we got along pretty well and I felt relieved because I was worrying too much my step kids wouldn't like me but I'm grateful to have met them and their mother.

My mom went crazy when I told her. She started arguing a lot. Telling me that marrying a single mother who's older than me wasn't going to happen, she got the whole family to agree with her. And tried pressuring me into going out with someone from the church who's nearly the same age as me.
I got fed up with this and I left after I told her no and that I was going to get married to my now wife with or without their approval.

My mom casually sent me a text the next day that she and the entire family disowned me and that I will never be allowed to come home after that then everyone blocked me and refused to talk to me.


My wife and I got married two months after I left home. We've now been married for 2 years and we have a 2 months old baby girl. She's the only girl with three boys so she was a sweet new addition to our family.

Last week. I started receiving calls from a number that I didn't recognize til I found out it was my mom. She knew that my wife and I had a baby girl and wanted to see her saying that my daughter is her grandbaby that she has a biological connection to.

I spoke with my friend who admitted telling my family about our newborn and how the whole family was excited to meet her. My sister reached out to me after I refused to let my mom visit and told me that I was being cruel and unfair to her for not wanting her to see her grandbaby. She told me that I shouldn't forget that my daughter is family and that will never change no matter what.


I got mad. I just couldn't help but get mad and argue with her because everyone sided with my mom who disowned me and told me to not come home ever again. And now they think I'd allow my mom to see my daughter because she is family to her.

They tried to set up a meeting twice but I refused. They're calling me cruel and using my daughter to get back at my mom for ""personal"" issues we had before.

His parents, mother in particular have never approved of his life choices and always favored his younger brother over him, and no matter what my husband did, they have never approved. 

My husband went limited contact with his family about a year after we got married when my MIL demanded he get a paternity test done on our oldest daughter because she didn't believe that she was his child. They have never met our two youngest children, and my husband and I have no plans to have them meet unless our children choose to do so. My MIL and I do not have a good relationship and I have not spoken to her in fifteen years.

Fast forward to last year. My FIL passed away and my MIL is not handling it well. Six months ago she fell and is having a hard time living on her own. My BIL called us last week and demanded that my husband take her in because he is ""too busy"" to take care of her. BIL also informed us that MIL has no money aside from her small teaching pension and cannot afford to stay in her house anymore. We asked what happened to the money she received from FIL's life insurance and it was spent.

Husband told my BIL we would discuss it and get back to him. I told him that in on uncertain terms was she coming here. My husband agreed, but feels guilty because she is his mother and will be homeless if he doesn't take her in. So I asked him about how much his mother cared about him being homeless when she threw him out of the house and he was sleeping in his car for three weeks. He said he understood, and he doesn't want her here either, but he doesn't want her to be on the streets.

I suggested we look into adult living facilities/care homes for seniors that we could move her into, as well as state funding to see if she qualifies. My husband is hesitant because he wnts to help his mother, but he also knows that her living with us is just not feasible because of the way she treats him.

He called his brother and told him that he didn't think her coming here was a good idea and brought up the suggestion about the senior living home and he flipped out. He called my husband ungrateful and shamed him for abandoning MIL in her time of need. Now his entire family is calling and texting and calling us cruel. Husband is starting to waffle and keeps saying that we could buy a house with an in-law suite.

My sister moved into my house. It's a one floor house with a loft. I was remodeling the loft but when the virus ramped up, I paused the remodel. The loft does not currently have a railing so we blocked off the stairs with a puppy gate and plan to finish it when it's safer health wise to have contractors around.

Her baby was three weeks old and my brother came to visit. He saw the loft without a railing and freaked out even though we showed him that the stairs were blocked. We explained multiple times that we don't go up there and there's no way that an infant can get up there either.

We thought that was the end of it, but he ended up calling CPS on her. They came to my house and did a whole check and interviewed both of us. In the end, the agent said it was fine and the case was dismissed, but it was extremely stressful and could end up being ammunition against her if her ex ever decides to take her to court. She won't speak to our brother and he's upset because he feels he was doing what was best for our nephew.

Like my wife, Lily loves fashion, and has a huge collection of designer clothes. We don't mean to spoil her, but she is generally well behaved and very academically talented (top of all her classes at school). 

Unfortunately, the teachers discovered that Lily and her friends had been bullying another girl, and that Lily was the ringleader. I won't go into detail but we were told that if not for Lily's exceptional academic record, she would have been expelled from school. 

We offered Lily two punishments. 1) No phone and no contact with her friends for however long we decide 2) No nice clothes for the same amount of time. She chose the second. My wife padlocked her wardrobe but took out a few plain tracksuits and t shirts that she rarely wears. 

Lily was understandably very upset. Like her mother, she likes to dress her best for a ten minute trip to the shop. She hates this punishment but still prefers it over the first one we offered. 

I got a call from my sister today, saying that Lily had phoned her up in ""floods of tears"" about not being allowed to wear the clothes she loves. Lily told her that she feels like she's in prison because she isn't allowed to wear what she wants. My sister said Lily had ""never sounded so upset"". She tried to say that clothing is an ""expression of her personality"" and that Lily feels vulnerable and insecure in the clothes we made her wear.

She and her husband have spent two years fighting for him and his health. Then Covid hit and what was already a very bad financial and emotional situation became worse. In September they were forced to leave their home due to a mold issue that may or may not have been there a while but went unnoticed because of how difficult the last couple of years have been on them. Then her husbands office was closed down and all employees were forced to move to the one in our town, three hours from where they lived before or find another job, which they did not feel safe doing in the current climate with their family circumstances. My husband and I discussed it and agreed to let them move in until after Christmas when hopefully the mold issue could be fixed and they could start the process to sell up and find another house.

So I will start by saying they pay for some groceries and help toward bills but not a lot because of their financial situation.

I started having an issue two weeks after they moved in. It was agreed upon by all four of us that I would make dinner and we would each do our own things for lunch. But she and their older kids started complaining about dinner, wanting something else, and expecting me to make it for them. It got to the point where the other night where my husbands sister asked me to make a lasagna for them in front of all the kids (both our husbands were at work) and her kids started to demand it where I lost it and told her if she didn't want to eat what I prepared then the least she could do is make it herself because it's not easy cooking enough for 9 people and then having 3 people reject it outright and often rudely, and expecting me to cook something very specific for them. It's even worse because the kids have made a fuss about dinner a lot since they got here and she says nothing to them and she isn't too far behind in that but at least she normally expresses it in a less demanding nature and has never pressed it in front of the kids before.

I have struggled with some guilt because they have a lot going on and I maybe should have just sucked it up. I can't always co-ordinate in advance about what they want for dinner but also, we don't always have whats needed to make what they want anyway and I'm already getting more groceries and doing more than I was before. I'm trying to be understanding but I worry I was an asshole. Things have been tense since. The complaints have not stopped though.

She also doesn't think it's fair to expect them to know what they'll wants days or weeks in advance. Her husband has promised his kids will behave better in the future but SIL doesn't think they were ever rude.

Because of an accident when I was a teen I am legally deaf and have very limited hearing normally but do alright with a hearing aid. Unless you’re shouting next to me, if I don’t have my hearing aid in, I can’t hear you. 

Because of Covid spikes in my country most major metro areas went into lockdown. My brothers (32M) wife (30F) was afraid to be in the city with their new baby (6 month F) and my brother asked me if they could stay with me in the countryside. I agreed as long as they cleaned up after themselves and respected my animals space. Me and my SIL get along okay but we’ve never been close, she doesn’t know much sign language so I have to rely on lip reading when we talk. I really only use my hearing aid when I go out, but I’ve gotten used to not wearing it at home, which is where the problem is.

My brother had to go into the city over the weekend for work leaving me, SIL, and the baby alone for the weekend. On Saturday I get up and while making breakfast I see that both my brothers car and SIL’s car are gone. I think nothing of it, and begin my morning routine. By noon my SIL’s car comes back and I’m training a colt. A bit later and the colt spooks bad and starts pulling away from me, I try to calm him but a hand griping my shoulder and spinning me around forces me to let him go. SIL was screaming at me, I was only getting every other word and struggling to read her lips because she was talking so fast.

Apparently the night before, at some point she had told me she was going into town to shop but didn’t want to take the baby, so she asked if I could watch her. To her I  answered and she took it as a yes, so this morning she went shopping and left the baby for three hours. I told her I never heard her request, and had I known would have absolutely watched the baby. She called me a negligent monster for not checking the house and just assuming she took her baby. I told her that was unreasonable and asked why she didn’t make sure I understood her before she left. She called me a plethora of insults, and stormed upstairs.

I feel awful, the baby had cried all morning and I had no idea. It makes me sad and sick thinking about it. I tried to reconcile with SIL but she won’t talk or look at me. My brother came back late Sunday and agreed with his wife, that I should have checked the house before going out to take care of the animals and that his daughter comes first. I told them their baby is their responsibility and my animals are mine, and that SIL should have really made sure I understood her request before leaving. We fought, and now things are tense.

I don’t feel like TA because I’m opening my home to them, I’m not a babysitter, and if SIL had a request I feel she should made it clear. But on the other hand my poor niece was left for three hours, and now even my parents are calling me negligent.

My husband and I have two little ones so we know almost all the kiddos in our block through the kids/school. Usually for Halloween we get a swarm of kids who don’t live in our neighborhood because I guess we’re known for better treats here? Anyways this has caused problems for us because we usually make Halloween goodies for the kids with cool things in it usually ranging from $5-$10. We’ve run into cases where we’ve had so many random kids in the neighborhood that by the time kids I actually know come over, the goodies are all gone. 

Last year my husband and I decided to just get a big of candy from Costco to give to the other kids and just save the Halloween goodies for kids we personally knew. Well afterwards my son came home from school and told me some kids from his school apparently stopped by our house(we don’t know them) and were mad they didn’t get the special bags. I do feel bad but we can’t afford to give a hundred kids these special bags, we usually set aside like 30 bags for all our neighborhood kids.

I am a mom of an only child(Jake) who just turned 9 back in August. Jake is obsessed with anything to do with building and wants to be an architect when hes older. I fully support this dream and have spent a crap ton of money buying the graph paper, the table, rulers, and the biggest expense, legos. He likes to spend his time drawing out his plans for his lego builds before he moves over to the blocks to actually build things and I think hes fantastic at it.

For his birthday, I cleared out our spare room and hubby and I set it up as Jake's ""office"" complete with a huge lego table. This room is my sons pride and joy and he spends alot of time in there. Anytime any kids come over, they have to have his permission to go in and we enforce it. Heres where the problem starts.

My SIL recently left her husband and her and her 3 kids came to stay with us. This would be fine if she hadn't started throwing a fit about Jake's office. She wants more room in our house even tho they have the entire finished basement that has a family room that they are using as a bedroom. She wants us to clear out Jake's office so she can have space away from her kids. When we told her no, she got angry. She then started demanding we let her kids play in there because Legos are toys and Jake needs to share. I told her she was out of her damned mind because Jake said he didnt want his cousins in there, that hes working on a huge project(he has been building a city). 

SIL went crazy and ended up destroying all the work Jake put into his build. ""Now theres no excuse"" I was beyond angry and went downstairs, grabbed her stuff, threw it into bags and threw it all out of my house, and told her to leave. 

Our family and my husband thinks i was a major ah for what i did and now I'm starting to question if I was.

Both me and my sister where left his estate in his Will when he passed. Our dad changed his Will a couple of years before he passed away, removing our mom from it. Our parents were separated and in the middle of divorce proceedings when he died.

My mom had an affair, which resulted in the breakdown of their marriage about 10 years ago. Subsequently it caused a lot of heart break, arguments and hostility not just between themselves but also for me and my sister towards our mom. This has somewhat resolved as the years passed, my sister was amicable with mom, for me... Our relationship was pretty much back to normal (I struggle with hating on others and find it easier to resolve the issue and carry on).

My dad confided in me some of the details of the divorce, most of which I would have rather not known, but he had no one else to speak with regarding it I suppose. Basically it did not paint my mom in the best light and honestly the actions and behaviours I observed her displaying following their separation tallied up to this. Unreasonable demands made with regards to finances and basically wanting to take most of my dad's pension.

Following his death when his Will was read to us we then discovered my mom had been written out of his Will. Our mom is wanting to take legal proceedings against us if we decide not to give her over half of the money he has left to us (she wants us to discuss via mediation). Our extended family who know some details about this issue appear divided as to what we do. Both myself and my sister believe she should not receive any of this money, however I feel guilty. But on the other hand her actions since his death and her apparent greed repulses me.

I didn’t expect to endure a night of constant jokes about my name but I did. He brought up the fact he had a pet rabbit named Coco when he was a kid and then joked about how I should order a meal that contained carrots, to top it off he asked me if my name was a nickname for cocaine. Maybe my sense of humor sucks but I was getting extremely frustrated so I snapped and told him that i was tired of his unoriginal jokes and he was being disrespectful. As you can imagine, it got pretty awkward after that. We haven’t spoken since but today my bestfriend told me that he thinks I’m a “snowflake.”

There's 3 rooms and I share a room with A (21M) because we have similar schedules and have been friends for years. My other female housemate (B) was dating C, and they obviously shared a room, with the other 3 guys in the biggest room.

Well, B and C recently broke up. She came to me and asked if I'd be willing to move into her room and C would move into mine, because it was awkward to cohabitate while dealing with the feelings from the breakup. I was like, yeah damn girl that's really rough, I feel like we wouldn't necessarily mesh as roommates though, could you ask one of the guys? For example, she wakes up early and I'm a night owl; she likes things super tidy and I'm more 'organized chaos'; she likes cutesy scented sprays that I'm not the best fan of. To which she said what no, she didn't want to room with a guy bc they're unsanitary/less neat. I said that sounded like a her problem (in nicer terms) and now she's basically giving me the cold shoulder.

AITA? I could switch and do her a solid (I definitely wouldn't want to be stuck in close quarters with a recent ex), but I like my room and I'm just casual friends with her and close with A, and I feel like it's a bit unfair that I'm the one expected to give up my living arrangement since I'm the only other girl.

The way the house is arranged is that it's a duplex house, she lives on the left side with her husband and two kids, I rent out the right side. Its basically it's own house, there are two enterences to the building and both halves are closed off.

I babysat once before as a favor when her husband had been in a car accident and she needed to go to the hospital immediately. I did it for free as a favor because it was an emergency.

But after that, she's asked me a lot to babysit, needing a break, saying how good I was with the girls, how it'd be nice for the girls to have an good female role model closer to their age then her (she is an older parent, I am 26 and the girls are 8 and 11.)

I said no at first and she kept pushing to say that she'd pay me, it would be no trouble at all because I'm right next door and if anything came up I could come and knock... 

I said no again.

Then a little while later her husband came to me and said that they really need a break and they'd pay me well to babysit just sometimes, what did I want? I said 100 dollars an hour. My side gig that I usually do after work is a freelance software engineering consultant and I charge 85, but for babysitting I would want additional hazard pay due to the potential covid exposure of having people out of my household in my home... A risk I don't have doing software.

He said I was out of my mind and I said that he wanted me to name a price and that's literally how I price my time. 

He got mad and was like ""a few evenings of that is equal to your rent,"" and I was like ""we can deduct it from my rent if that would make bookkeeping easier""

I called my parents later and my mom thought it was really rude of me to accept with a ridiculous number instead of decline... Like she thought if I didn't want to do it, I should have just said no instead of being a smartass about it.

203,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jig4c4/aita_for_calling_the_police_on_someone_who_parked/,AITA for calling the police on someone who parked in my driveway?,"Last Saturday our  neighbors had a yard sale. There was a decent amount of people that stopped by and they were fine parking in my neighbors driveway. We live on a very busy street, so parking on the road is a nuisance as there is no shoulder and people tend to drive well over the 35MPH speed limit that is posted.

To be clear, it is very obvious that this is our driveway on our property. We do not share an easement with the neighbors, so this person purposely pulled into our driveway because the neighbor's was full from other people at their yard sale. The way he was parked completely blocked both of our cars in so if we needed to get out, we couldn't.

About an hour into the sale, we noticed a car pull into our driveway. I asked my husband if he was expecting anyone and he said that he wasn't so he went outside to see what they wanted. He saw the driver, a passenger and two children get out of the car and walk over to the neighbor's yard sale. My husband called out to the driver of the car and told him he can't park there and to move his car. He told my husband that he had nowhere to park and the kids were with him and it was too dangerous to park on the street. My husband said he understood, but he needed to move the car out of our driveway.

The man proceeded to argue with my  husband until he finally told him to either move his car or we will call and have it towed. My husband came inside and asked me to call the non-emergency police line to see if someone could come out and ask the driver to move the car out of our driveway. An officer arrived within 10 minutes and my husband explained the situation to him. The other driver began ranting at the officer about not having a safe place to park, and the officer told him that it didn't' matter, that he was on our property and he could either move the car or the officer would call to have him towed.

The man started screaming curses at my husband and told him that if one of his kids got injured because he had to park in the road he was going to sue us. My neighbors (the ones having the yard sale) came over and told us that we were assholes for making such a commotion over them being parked in our driveway. My husband explained that they were the ones having the yard sale, not us, and that he would have never allowed strangers to park in their driveway because it's just rude.

Now my neighbors are badmouthing us to all of our other neighbors. Some agree that we were in the right, but the ones to the immediate right of us are now being cold to us and telling us that we are insensitive and have no sense of community.

So AITA or should I have let it go and let the man park in my driveway?

ETA: People keep asking why we called the police, we called them because the driver was becoming increasingly hostile and swearing. He threatened to sue us. We would most likely have let him stay if he had just asked us first. The second he started cursing at my husband, he had to leave, we do not know him, did not know what he would do or was capable of nor did we invite him. He was there for a neighbors yard sale that had nothing to do with our property.",2020-10-26 15:02:00,1697,14232,0.95,1,0,204,2,,10,6,2,3,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My dad wasn’t doing good with money so he split custody with my aunt since she was also my godmother. I spent most days with my aunt and then a couple days with my dad because his work had him on the road a lot. 

2 yrs ago my dad came out and it was weird af ngl but I got over it after months. He hasn’t dated anyone that I know of. Like only one guy but it was less than 6 mos. Last year he got a better job that keeps him here so he had me come move in with him. 

First thing I noticed was that he has guys over like ALL the time. And I mean multiple guys, 4-5 sometimes a week depending how busy he is. Literally like different  guys every single time and it’s always really awkward. They don’t know me I don’t know them an now they r here in the house. My dad told me he’s just meeting different guys for fun and not to worry because it’s not anything serious but now I rlly don’t like it. 

Sometimes my dad leaves early for work and these guys are just left at the house or they roam around while he’s still sleeping in his room. There’s been times where I’m going to eat breakfast and there’s a rando in the kitchen w nothing but boxers on

Idk it makes me uncomfortable cause he doesn’t know who these guys are and they all know where he lives. Plus he leaves them alone in the house until they leave on their own. I’ve talked to my dad before and he says nothing bad’s gonna happen because he’ll protect and he’s just having fun. 

But how he gonna protect me when he’s the one leaving the house with me alone and then still there?? This something we’ve talked about a few times but he still doesn’t treat it like a big deal until I told him the other day if he’s gonna keep having random people over all the time then I’m just gonna move back in with my aunt. 

That made my dad sad and angry. He said he thought since it’s been years now that I’m okay with his sexuality and him finally getting to be this side of himself. I told him it had nothing to do with that I’d be saying the same if it was random ladies too because again they all know where he lives and he leaves them alone. 

Now he’s just not talking to me being all hurt. I haven’t told my aunt any of this yet. He still has guys over so I don’t wanna be here anymore feeling like I gotta tiptoe around the house every night. But I feel bad that this hurt him and idk if it was right to threaten leaving making him think I don’t support him.

They thought having another baby would magically fix things but they were wrong as it just caused more problems and strained their finances. They were in over their heads and decided go give eddie up for adoption I begged them not to but they had made up their minds, social workers asked other family members if anyone would like to take eddie, both my older brothers refused and my grandparents were too old so I took my brother in. This royally annoyed my parents and I was threatened with disownedment but I didn't care as I already had a place of my own with an ex at that time

My folks lost their paternal rights and I legally adopted my brother and I love him so much and was proud to be his daddy. My brothers didn't approve of me adopting him but I didn't care as they had never met him even when he was still with my parents. My grandparents helped me out a lot and were great. Unfortunately they have both passed since then and left me what money they had left to raise my bro. My folks and siblings were pissed but my aunt and uncles didn't care and thought it was best. At family events over the years my folks would be uncomfortable when I'd show up with Eddie but within the last year they had seemed to warm up a tad and I figured they themselves wanted to act more like grandparents as he is legally my son.

During the last few months however I've noticed my parents and brothers try and talk to Eddie on their own about if he knows who his mummy and daddy is. He says I'm daddy and usually I walk in and scold them before the conversation can go much further than that. I've yet to tell him the truth and I know I have to one day but I don't think now is the right time and even if it was I should be the one to tell him.

The other day I caught my mum trying to talk to Eddie about this again when she was visiting me, ed and my current partner. I asked my bf to take Eddie out for a bit where me and my mum got into an argument, she thinks I'm being a terrible parent and that its time she and my dad take Eddie back. I told her that there is no way I'm letting that happen so I kicked her out. Now my parents are threatening to sue for custody and my brothers agree while aunts and uncles say they support me no matter what

Edit 2: okay so I told him, its half term here in the UK so he didn't have school. Around lunchtime I took him to get his favourite food, we then went for a walk in the park talking about family and stuff. Eventually we sat down and I told him about how I adopted him but I'm still daddy and that I still loved him but then I explained how I came to look after him. Its fair to say he didn't understand some things and has been a bit quieter than usual but he cuddled up to me while I was watching a film I loved when I was a kid and said ""I love you daddy"" when I put him to bed.

We did most things together and she even lived with me for a bit when she turned 18. It's been great and I even see her as more of a little sister than a cousin. 

From ages 13-25, I dated and was engaged to Mark(27m). My cousin knew him well. When I turned 25, Mark and I had a serious discussion about marriage and children and ended up breaking up. He had lied to me our entire adult relationship about wanting marriage and kids. It killed me. My cousin was there for me the entire time. You can probably see where this is going.

A month ago, my cousin announced she was pregnant and engaged! I was excited for her until I went over for a celebratory family cookout and met her newly moved in fiance. Guess who it was? Yep, it was Mark. My world came crashing down and I just left. I didnt say anything, i just walked out. Family tried calling, my cousin tried calling and texting me but I didnt answer anyone.

 After about a week, I finally answered my cousins call. She told me she needed me to be there for her and she knew it was weird, but he was going to be family and I should be happy for her. I told her I couldnt support any of this and to please not contact me again.

I now have family telling me what's done is done and i need to get over it because cousin is getting married and having a baby, that i need to think of her and that this is an exciting time for the family.

Whenever my boyfriend trims his beard, he likes to clear off a section on the sink, on that section, usually sits my makeup bag, toothbrush pot, and some skincare bits. He usually puts all this stuff on the literal *edge* of the other side of the sink. I always tell him to please not to do that with my makeup bag at least, because it's full of expensive Clinique make-up products that cost at least £200. I'm 19, I can't afford to replace all that easily, I worked my butt off to save enough to get myself those makeup products as is.

Anyway, you probably know what's coming, once again, he was trimming his beard, and after the million times I told him not to put my makeup on the edge of the counter, he did it again, and surprise surprise, it fell and the majority smashed, the powders, highlighter, and eyeshadows all broke into little pieces, the foundation bottle broke in half, the only salvageable things in there was a mascara, an eyeliner and two lipsticks.

I was devastated, he told me I shouldn't be so emotionally invested in these monetary objects and said if I didn't want it to fall I should have moved it somewhere else in the first place.

I asked him if he could help me replace at least the foundation and eyeshadows, but he said it wasn't his fault because it was an accident.

AITA for asking in the first place?

Edit: just to clarify where my makeup bag sat, it was in a very safe position on my side of the counter, I told him when he trims his beard he can move the makeup anywhere else on the sink, just not the edge, our sink is one of those double counter ones and there's plenty of space to put things on.

Edit 2: to add on from the first edit as I was asked to add this bit- we have one sink which has counter space on both ends. One side is his and he doesn't like moving everything and getting beard hairs on his stuff so he uses my side when shaving, which is much more minimalist, so he only has to move the makeup bag which always goes on the edge for whatever godforsaken reason.

**Final edit: well, I brought it up again after all your comments, he's not budging on helping with the cost. And the biggest thing of all, a lot of you were right, it wasn't an accident, it was deliberate, so I'll leave it at that. Thanks to you all, I've come to realize that this may not be the healthiest relationship for me to be in, I've spoken to my mum so she knows what's going on and I'll probably be gathering my things to move out soon. I definitely wasn't expecting for things to take such a turn today, but I am thankful for all your comments and the people who private messaged me with helpful resources.

He got to complaining about my non religious lifestyle, drinking alcohol, and not watching the church livestream on Sundays. I told him it was my house, and as a guest he needed to adapt himself to my lifestyle. 

He started to get really upset, said he cared about me and he wanted our family to be strong in the lord. He shared how god helped him through a bad time when his first wife died.

He was more receptive and turns out no one else in the company actually had experience working/living in Asia so they’d have been looking at an outside hire. Long story short I present my case and the CFO liked it because now I’m the number 2 guy in Singapore and people will be reporting to me (which is still surreal to me). 

However despite all this my boss was pissed because I ‘undermined him’ by going to his boss’s boss. Said it was a violation of corporate ethics etc. Even a couple of people on my level have said it’s bang out of order to go up the scale like this? I don’t really get why and I said “at the end of the day I got what I wanted so it must’ve been alright”. 

This pissed them off even more, but I guess at this point it shouldn’t affect me?",2020-11-25 17:06:04,326,4318,0.98,7,2,177,2,,3,1,1,1,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
210,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k2eu7l/aita_for_not_inviting_my_sil_to_my_baby_shower/,AITA for not inviting my SIL to my baby shower?,"My husband (28M) and I(26F) had been trying for a little over 2 years to pregnant and now we are. My SIL Ava(32F) has been trying to get pregnant for 10 years though, so I was very thoughtful about how we would break the news to her. We told her in private and before we announced publicly. She took it well (or so I thought) My husband asked her if she’d be willing to be the Godmother and she said no. Understandable

Like I said , we’d also been ttc for two years so I had followed some fertility pages on IG. When I found out I was pregnant, I started to unfollow the pages, but I found Ava in the comments on one of them and these were some of the comments she’d posted. 

“honestly atp I fucking hate baby showers. I spend the entire time loathing whoever’s pregnant and being enraged it’s not me. I wish people would just stop inviting me.” 

On another post: “Ugh. Relatable. My SIL, sister and cousin are all pregnant right now. My SIL just announced she’s pregnant and the thoughts that went through my mind... & then they had the nerve to ask if I wanted to be the Godmother. HELL NO. I don’t even want to meet the thing at this point.”  + some other nasty comments. 

Then I found out she’d been talking about me to a mutual friend saying things like: “2 years isn’t even a long time for ttc” & “she doesn’t even deserve a baby, I’ve been waiting longer.” She also told my MIL she wasn’t coming to any more family dinners for the rest of the year because she couldn’t stand to look at me. 

I approached Ava about the comments, it turned it an argument & I told her that I thought her behavior was disgusting & she was not going to be around my child. She said some more vile things. I cut off contact.

Fast forward to this month, baby shower invites have been sent out (my country is semi-back to normal and we can now meet in groups again) & she’s angry she wasn’t invited. She thinks I would still want her around after all that, & telling my other SIL (who is also currently pregnant), that she hopes she loses her baby so she can experience the pain she’s felt. 

My husband says he wants to forgive her, and I told him he can if he wants but she won’t be at the shower. Ava’s husband has reached out to us and said verbatim: “You better not even THINK about apologizing. This is getting out of hand & I refuse to wallow in her bitterness so send me an invite because I’m coming with my gift.” We sent his. 

I feel sympathetic but I have to cut her off. I’ve been nothing but nice to her. She’s been taking hormones to get pregnant and a mutual friend swears that I should let everything go because of that but honestly, taking a medicine could very well be the reason she’s being a bitch but that doesn’t mean I have to accept being on the receiving end of it all.

I’m a (18M) and been dealing with my hyper religious parents. 

My mother has always preached that a man and woman have there set roles in the house. Basically the man works and the woman does housework. So growing up I never liked this mindset. My mother would literally shove me out the house to work with my dad and have my sisters help her cook and clean.

But to the main story. My mothers been really sick lately (not corona) and she’s been unable to cook or do anything. My dad has been used to just having her cook so we’ve been surviving on a diet of takeout. If I have to eat another Wendy’s 4 for 4 I’ll lose it.

So I decided to use some money I had set aside to go to the store and cook a homemade meal. I watched a lot of people cooking it. It wasn’t the first time I’ve cooked, but it was the first time I’ve cooked for my parents. My dad will eat anything so I didn’t expect a record on how good it was from him.

But I gave some to my mom and she made comments like I’m a boy and can’t do the job right or whatever, and even after she ate it (multiple servings) she still told the family on our weekly FaceTime calls how bad it was and I should stick to working outside.

I knew she was going too, but i felt shitty having her laugh at my genuine effort. So I stopped doing everything I would do in the house. All the “womanly” tasks such as cleaning, washing the dishes and such. 

Since she was stuck in her bed she didn’t see how the house got. When she finally got better to walk around she saw how dirty it was. She began to yell at me for not cleaning and I reminded her that those were by her stands a woman’s job. 

She flipped and began to rage on our weekly FaceTime calls. So when my family asked me why I didn’t help I explained to her that she said those were woman’s jobs and I should be outside working, which I was. (I built a folding table out of only wood 😁) 

Now my family is laughing at her and she’s pissed. Some of my sisters said they know what she said, but she was sick as bedridden so I should of been the bigger man and done it anyway. 

But I think I was just listening to what she said. So AITA?",2020-11-14 17:39:09,499,9966,0.97,11,1,216,12,,4,4,1,3,,3,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weird thing is that I am a guy. A gay guy is true, but apart from that I am not interested in wearing typical women’s clothing or something similar. I just loved how it looked, the way it folded, the pattern, the material, everything. I ended up buying it and later found a female steel wire to create a ""homemade"" display of it in my living room. It has been there for almost 3 years (in perfect condition, I may add) and you could say is my favorite furniture piece if that makes sense. 

So, what is the problem now. My cousin is marrying next summer if certain global catastrophe allows it. After looking in a lot of boutiques (and I mean, a A LOT) she has concluded that the only dress she wants for such an event is MY dress. We are not even close to the wedding, but she has been insistent in that I should sell it to her for her big day. She has told me that she would even pay me more than the original price, so money is not the dealbreaker. 

The fact is, that as I said before, I love that dress. For me is like if she was asking me to sell her my favorite couch or something like that. I don’t want to part ways with it just so she can use it for a day and then hide it forever in some closet. I told her she could just have a designer create a copy of it, but she is adamant on having the original because she wants to preserve it's ""uniqueness"" and borrowing it has never been an option. 

The conflict is basically between her, my aunt, my uncle and her whole bridal party against me , arguing that it is dumb that I am attached to a piece of fabric I have never or will ever wear myself or let anyone else use. The rest of the family, including my parents, are taking a neutral stance on the matter.

213,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/k046ln/aita_for_not_taking_in_my_ex_partners_kids/,AITA for not taking in my ex partners kids,"Okay so my title should read: AITA for not taking in my ex partner's parents kids.

I wrote this on my lunch break and it was the only thing I didn't double check before posting, feel free to chew me out for that mistake.

Just be honest with me here as if I'm the arsehole I will fully understand. All names of course are fake and I'm really bad at titles and summaries so bare with me.

I (29/m) lost my ex partner Olive of 8 years to cancer (she was 26) 3 years ago. She left me behind with our daughter Eve who is now 6. I won't lie, it's been a tough ride trying to cope with a small child without a lot of help from Olive's side of the family. Olive's parents Pat (47/f) and Rich (48/m) will only contact me over Eve, to cry about Olive being gone or it involves me looking after their other 3 kids A 13/m, B 10/m and C 9/m.

This brings me sorta onto my problem here where I could be the arsehole. Eve of course misses her mom a lot and has sorta created rituals to remember her. Eve often ask for candles to be lit so her mom knows she remembers her, she will buy her mom flowers for the house and will get highly upset if we need to move items her mom really cared about, This infuriates Pat as she acts like she's the only one able to mourn or remember Olive. She has demanded items Olive loved to be returned to her and has snapped at Eve that she couldn't even remember what her mommy smelled like so she clearly wasn't missing Olive as much as her. In short, it's been a long 3 years.

For the past 3 months Pat has gotten into screaming matches with me because she claims she can't cope with the loss of Olive and I need to step up to help her with the boys. I have pointed out Rich could take the kids but he's needed to apparently take care of her and her needs. Her idea is for me to take in the 3 boys help them cope with their 'mourning' so she can fully 'mourn' the loss of Olive and basically be a parent to 4 kids at once.

I really, really don't want to do this as the three boys in my opinion are uncontrollable. They will do anything for a reaction. Each time you try to either find out why they do it or punish them they will run to Pat who excuses their behavior as they are mourning their sister. My final reason for not taking them in at all is the fact B and C have told Eve that she's the reason her mom got cancer and passed away before denying they said it with smirks on their faces.

I've refused to take them as honestly it's gonna add more stress onto me, Eve will be a target for them and Pat refuses to give me a rough time limit of when she'd actually take them back. Of course that isn't the answer Pat wanted and she has been blowing up my phone calling me an arsehole for not caring about Olive's family but to me I think I'm right not wanting to deal with the boys around my daughter.

So reddit, AITA?

EDIT - In short, the three boys are Eve's uncles and Olive's siblings.

Pat and Rich are Eve's grandparents and Olive and the boys parents.

I'm Eve's dad who dated Olive and wasn't sure how to class my relationship with Pat and Rich as such as Ex-MIL or past MIL.

I have learnt I'm bad at Reddit and explaining my family situation.

EDIT 2 - This blew up more than I expected, as I expected maybe a couple of replies not at the time of this edit at 408 comment. I will update when things happen but I do plan to cut contact for least the time being. I do no have any plans to look after the three boys either.",2020-11-24 12:34:59,440,2991,0.96,7,1,228,2,,,1,4,2,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our kid enrolled in a local school which is open despite you-know-what.

&#x200B;

Apparently his ""science"" teacher will dedicate the next month of his class to the ""intelligent design"" theory. I could not believe my ears when I heard this. Wtf is intelligent design and how on Earth did this make its way into the school curriculum? How can the government allow a **science** teacher present this alongside Darwinism as a valid school of thought? I saw red, I'll be honest.

&#x200B;

Long story short I confronted the teacher. Won't lie, I laid it in thick and was pretty disparaging in my commentary. I remained civil and criticized only the theory itself though. I demanded this is taken out of the curriculum. Teacher disagreed strongly and I escalated to the principal who backed him up. I'm now looking for legal ways to escalate further and at this stage I want the teacher removed from his position as I think he's unqualified to teach science to anybody let alone impressionable teenagers.

&#x200B;

AITA? Some folks tell me ""when in Rome (or Southern US in this case).."" and all that.

&#x200B;

I frankly have my mind blown anyone would think this is acceptable. In my home country it would have made front page and the school administration would be on the street looking for new jobs for being dumb beyond what's legal under our Constitution. Reddit, give me a new perspective - am I being culturally insensitive?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I should clarify, the teacher has a certain level of control over the curriculum. It's clear teaching intelligent design is not mandated by the state.

EDIT 2: I guess I need to say this out loud. Intelligent design is not a scientific theory. It’s a made up fairy tale. Teaching it to kids is not “allowing them to exercise their critical thinking.”  It’s elevating a bogus and nonsensical claim to the same status as scientifically sound research. It’s like claiming that it’s ok to teach astrology as part of an astronomy class “because it’s local culture and you can’t scientifically prove it’s incorrect.” Except you can and many have.",2020-10-29 00:53:37,1657,9047,0.92,0,0,180,0,,4,5,4,5,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,4,,,1,,,,,,,,,3,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

&#x200B;

You see, festival season is here - Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year, Lunar New year etc and as a gifting company we are busier than usual during this period. 

&#x200B;

The routine would be for our department to stay back after work to help the packing department to pack gifts, because we have mountains of gifts to pack, all labeled differently with different level of care and things can get very confusing and unorganized. This isn't compulsory nor paid, we ""voluntarily"" show up, that's how it is.

&#x200B;

I would usually do maybe 1-2 times and then leave on time, not willing to spend more doing free work. My colleagues from my own department and the packing department would also give me dirty looks whenever I do that, because it means 1 less helper and that they would go home later, and I am the only one who constantly do that. I don't usually care much because I stand firm on the point that I work for how much I am paid for, even if they hate me for it it isn't my fault.

&#x200B;

Yesterday it happened again, only this time one of my department lady asked me to stay because she couldn't, she needed to bring her children somewhere. I told her that since it's voluntary work, she could leave as soon as we are off duty. She then told me that if she did, everyone else would have to stay back later and that would be her fault. I told her again she was free to leave, just like me, and I left anyway.

&#x200B;

I came to work today with the same dirty looks from my colleagues, and one of them came up to me and told me that because of my selfishness, everyone, including the lady who wanted to leave, had to stay back until 8pm. The lady broke her promise to bring her children to see the glass Christmas tree display somewhere as it was very late. If I had stayed they could probably have finished it much earlier, and I wouldn't do it because I wanted to go home and enjoy my evening alone with my dogs.

&#x200B;

I did tell the lady that she was free to go if she really wanted to, nobody was forcing her to stay. If she had anyone to blame then blame the management for not hiring more part-timers during busy periods, or herself for putting work over children. Packing gifts for another department is not my job nor am I paid for the evening hours doing it, so why should I stay? I have avoided doing this for the past few years and I am still hired, so this isn't against any company rules.

For the sake of length I'll try to stick to the facts and keep it brief. I (50m), legally have three children with my ex (51), Adam (23m), Chris (21m) and Sophie (18f). Biologically the first two children are mine and youngest is the result of my wife's infidelity. I discovered this the day when Sophie was two-years-old and we had to rush Sophie to the emergency room. I filed for divorce two months later.

I got 50/50 custody of my own children but since Sophie was legally ""mine"" I had to pay child support for her and was very bitter and resentful about it. I tried to fight it at first but in the end decided to suck it up to save myself the stress, but I made it very clear to my ex that outside of child support I would take no other responsibility for the girl and would shut down any attempts at being her father, but I would make the effort to still be polite to Sophie.

After some time I learned to trust again and remarried a wonderful woman who made it very clear that she and her daughter were a package deal. I accepted this and did everything I could to try and be there for my stepdaughter Katie (17f). Aside from the typical ups and downs I would say I managed to make a great family life for myself. We'd have family nights, I attended most after school events, took my family on fun vacations and put my sons through school and paid for their apartments and cars. They were own their own for gas money.

Chris is expected to graduate this coming summer and I made a silly post on social media about how relieved I was going to be that I only had one more kid to put through school left. A couple of days later I got a message from my ex asking me to pay for Sophie's college expenses on my own since the pandemic has made money tight. I asked her what she meant and referred to my post and I reminded her that my legal obligation to Sophie ended the day she turned 18 and that I was talking about Katie.

My ex was furious demanded to know why I was willing to pay for Katie and not Sophie since neither of them are related to me. I countered by saying that I knew upfront Katie wasn't my biological child and agreed to care for her instead of being conned into doing it like I was for Sophie. After that I got a call from Sophie asking what she did to make me hate her so much and to leave her feeling so excluded. I told her softly that I don't hate her and that nothing about this situation was her fault, but the simple truth is that it wasn't personal I'm just not her father. Since then my sons have told me that Sophie was becoming really depressed, my ex is blaming me but I don't see what I have to do with it AITA?

Edit: Just to be clear because I keep seeing the same questions

1. The kids know why I divorced their mother
2. My ex claims that Sophie was the result of a one nightstand and doesn't know who her father is, which is one of the reasons why I was kept on the hook for CS.
3. After I learned the truth I was very angry and didn't think I could handle raising a child that I was tricked into caring for so I decided to keep my distance.
4. Just because Sophie wasn't mine and I treated as such doesn't mean that I was horrible to the girl. I also made sure that my children knew that what happened between their mother and me was not Sophie's fault and they should never be mean to her.

Update: Mods didn't approve separate post so here it is.

&#x200B;

Thank you to everyone for their kind words of support. A lot of you have suggested therapy and for the longest time I never felt like I needed it, but after everything new that's happened I've decided that talking to a professional won't hurt. I thought I buried my anger and hurt toward my ex years ago but now new information has been revealed that's just making me angry all over again.

Not too long after my initial fight with my ex, she and Sophie got into a fight that ended up so bad that Sophie was kicked out of the home. Sophie called her brothers and they in turn called me and she is currently staying with my wife, Katie, and I. Apparently, in spite of my efforts to maintain a boundary, my ex kept telling Sophie that if she was well behaved and did good in school that I would think of her as a ""daughter"" again. It was my ex's way of getting Sophie to be obedient.

When I made my post Sophie thought that I was finally giving her the validation that my ex had always promised and when I didn't it was just chaos. Sophie called my ex horrible names and demanded to know who her bio dad. My ex refused and told her if she was going to be disrespectful she had to live elsewhere.

Originally, some of you suggested that in spite of Sophie's blood type she could still be my daughter and that was really starting to get to me. Now that Sophie was staying with me I took some of her DNA and sent it off for testing and couldn't believe the results that I sent it again for a second time. To my shock Sophie and I are indeed related, she's just not my daughter.

Like I said, the bad feelings are all starting to come back to me again but this new information is just putting me in a bad place again. I don't even know how or when to break the news to Sophie or how to even confront my ex about any of this. I feel like such a fool.",2020-10-16 05:52:05,4285,6640,0.94,33,2,139,25,,2,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
217,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jytd58/aita_for_refusing_to_raise_my_brother_in_laws_kids/,AITA for refusing to raise my brother in laws kids,"I (28F) have been married for 4 years. My husband (29) has a brother who is 2 years older than him, lets call him Ben. Ben has 2 kids (6yrs) and (9mths) with a woman called Amy.

When Ben was still with Amy, he was an a-hole towards her, he promised to marry her but never did, instead he cheated on her multiple times. So about 2 years ago Ben was caught cheating again and this was Amy’s last straw and they broke up. I should add Ben knew Amy was a few weeks pregnant at this point.

Amy who had been living with her mother decided to move closer to the city to look for work. soon enough she found herself a boyfriend and moved in with him, this caused Ben to become enraged. He threw another online tantrum saying he didnt want his kids being raised by a stranger, and even threatened to stop supporting the kids financially if they continue living with the bf. Amy resorted to sending her kids back to to live with her mother. unfortunately, a few weeks ago, Amy's mom had a stroke and is now incapable of caring for herself, much less the kids.

so now I found out that Ben asked my husband if we can raise his two kids for him. he says he doesn’t have the time to do it because he has to work as a teacher and come home to mark schoolwork. he says since I work remotely Im the only one capable of taking care of the kids. I refused and I'll give my reasons:

1. I already have 2 kids to take care of who are under the age of 3.
2. I dont want to have to spend any more time with Ben than I already do, he’s a misogynist, stupid brat. the fact that he thought it would be okay to speak to my husband only, about us raising his kids proves my point.
3. We have very different life views and parenting strategies and raising his kids would interfere with my autonomy in raising mine. For example, I bought my son a play stove and Ben made a lot of unnecessary comments about the toy being for girls Infront of my son. Thankfully, my husband told him to back off but this is just one example of why I think he's a bad influence for a child.
4. I think this whole situation is because of Bens incapability to grow up. i think he could care for the kids himself but he wants to live the bachelor life and continue drinking with his friends instead of raising his own kids.

this is why my husband disagrees: I told him i might have been willing to raise the kids if Ben and Amy were dead or if they were incapable of caring for the kids because of something they can't control, but Im not willing to raise them just so the parents can do other things . This made my husband say that Im punishing the kids because of the parents mistakes. he says he feels that both Ben and Amy are not good enough parents because Ben drinks too much and Amy introduced the kids to a bf she had only known for a short time. he says if you see kids suffering you should be willing to step in, even if the parents are at fault, the kids are innocent.

edit: Im sorry if this is not the proper way to post an update, I'm still not used to this app. I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who commented on this post, and thank you for the awards. I havent been able to respond to many comments as i have been very busy and I didnt expect to receive so many but I let my husband read the comments. He was a bit pissed that I wrote about the situation but now understands my point of veiw a lot better. Right now the kids are with Ben because its the beginning of summer, where we live and the school holidays are about to start, so he wont be teaching anyway. I have made it clear to my husband that Ben needs to use this time to start looking for a nanny or daycare. I havent bothered to say this to Ben since he didnt bother to speak to me in the first place. 

I will post another update with the outcome for those of you who are interested. Until then, Cheers!!",2020-11-22 10:07:53,465,3267,0.97,0,4,257,1,,1,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had a conversation with my fiancee and told her that I don't want to create an environment in our home where racism or homophobia is tolerated, and that we have the right to create an environment in our house that visitors need to respect. I brought this up because we have guests coming to dinner and though I don't expect this to be an issue I want to be on the same page with her in case it becomes one.

The trick is that there's a major cultural divide. Without getting to specific, there is a lot of implicit racism and homophobia in my fiancee's culture and she has told me that many of her friends say things to her that they would never say to me. She tells me that I just don't understand the culture, that they aren't doing any harm and it's just words, and that if we put this rule in place then none of her friends could come over and I would be cutting them all off.

As an example, she asked if I would ask someone to leave our house if they called black people ""monkeys."" I said yes absolutely, that's over the line and not acceptable in our house. She told me that that is just how some people are and it's not harming anyone and that I'm not flexible, and rejecting her culture -- and also that it's always my beliefs and values that control and dominate what we do and how she acts. I'm kind of blindsided by all of this. I do understand the difference between ignorance and malice, but at the same time I'm not comfortable having this kind of language and bigotry in our home. We don't have kids yet so I feel like I can tolerate more, but it's not acceptable to me for our future kids to be exposed to that kind of language and those ideas. Our conversation got pretty intense and somehow my values and boundaries just got swept by the wayside?

Am I being too inflexible?

I (32F) had a child at the age of 16 with a 20 year old guy (Isaac)  and he ended up giving up his rights few months after the birth of our daughter.

Now, he came back in her life when my daughter was 12 and she wanted to meet her father and spend time with him so Isaac and I decided that he can have her on the weekends. 

He has been a good dad ever since but recently he has made friends with some drug and alcohol addicts and he invites them to his house on weekends too.

 My daughter rather feels uncomfortable with them in the same house as her, as some of them are always drunk and tend to misbehave. She tried talking to her dad but her dad doesn't take her seriously and when I tried to talk to him. He argued that he can have any kind of friends he wants and I am no one to put a ban on it.

My daughter doesn't really feel comfortable going there on weekends when the house is full of alcoholic and they party all night.

WIBTA if I stopped the visitation until he makes sure his friends are out of the house when my daughter goes there?

Edit:- I have decided to stop the weekends visits completely , thanks for the people who commented their judgement.

My in-laws gifted us the condo when we got married and the mortgage is all paid off, so we never charged her any rent. It only has three bedrooms and we use one for the home office, one for our bedroom, and let my sister stay in the third one.

My husband and I decided that we were finally in a good enough financial situation this year to have a baby and let my sister know that she needed to move out before the baby was born. We want to convert her room into the nursery. However, she’s been complaining to everyone that we are kicking her out in the middle of a pandemic and has been asking us to convert the home office into the nursery so that she can keep her room. I do feel bad for her since she’s had to take out a ton of loans to cover her college tuition already and the rent prices in New York are insane but we need our home office since we both work from home and feel like we have to do what is best for our baby first. AITA?

Edit: My husband and I have been waiting to have kids for years so waiting another 2 years for her to finish college is not an option for us. We both work from home and need separate rooms when we work as we do have a lot of meetings during the day. We never promised my sister that she could stay with us all four years of her college. But since we had the space and she asked, we were fine with her staying. Starting a family is the most important thing to us right now and I have to put my husband and our family plans before my sister.

He has two kids (11 and 8) from his previous marriage and has 50/50 split custody. Because of the pаndemic I moved in with him pretty shortly after we started dating, since he needed help with the kids at home. This has actually worked out great: the kids and I get along fantastic, they are a total delight to be around.

Neither my boyfriend nor his ex wife could cook worth a damn (we’re talking spaghetti from a can/kraft mac and cheese level cooking here). I on the other hand am a massive foodie and love to cook, and now do 100% of the cooking in the house. **Here’s the problem: now that the kids know what real food tastes like, they’re absolutely refusing to eat anything the ex wife cooks for them.**

The ex demanded that I either stop cooking, or send her money to pay for the takeout she’s been having to buy for every meal. Obviously these are ridiculous demands, but to keep the peace I offered to cook enough extra food for the kids to take to the ex’s house to last for the week. This suggestion enraged the ex even more, who said that I’m insulting and undermining her as a parent, and that I need to stop acting like a mom to her kids. AITA here?

P.S. I know the dating timeframe looks sketchy and people will inevitably ask “did you have an affair?”, the answer is NO.

It broke my heart and I was angry. My biggest source of anger came from the frustration that I had to co-parent with him and the fact she was going to be my kids stepmom after everything she did to me. I was so angry that I wrote a novel and got a lot of my anger and frustration out in that. That book wasn't much but I self-published it a year after the divorce, thinking nothing of it. I made some pocket change on it and mostly forgot it existed. 

I didn't use their names or anything but there were some details that are unique to us or at least would be not be details in every cheating situation with a friend.

My ex's wife picked up my book during lockdown and they put the pieces together. I denied it but he said he knew it was me and he was furious. He was furious that I would put out something like that about them and risk the kids finding it. He accused me of trying to feed the kids information that would turn them against him and his wife. But the book was under a pen name that has nothing to do with me and my kids do not know I wrote a book. They also know their dad cheated. They were old enough to put the pieces together when dad moved in in June and was engaged in July. I have told them any issues between their father and I are not about them and they do not have to hate them for me. That conversation killed me but for them I had it.

Ex claims it was reckless and selfish for me to do it. I told him he had no right to judge me.

Do you guys think he's right that I should at least never have published it? Nobody else would know but the three of us and it's not all that huge. It sold very little and I'm not leaving copies in my home.

My teacher mentioned a statistic that states that on average every tenth person is gay/not straight. upon hearing that the aforementioned christian girl snickerd and ""whispered"" loud enough so that everyone could hear it ""so OP is definitely one of those lesbians"" so I just turned around, winked at her and said ""you wish"" (admittedly I had that idea from an old tumblr post)

after I said it she turned pale and was clearly shaken, asking me how I could accuse her of such a thing. I just laughed and told her to loosen up a bit. a few classmates also laughed and she started crying and had to leave the classroom. at the time I didn't feel bad and I still don't (not really) but both my teacher and a few classmates told me after the lesson to go and apologise and I should have known not to say such a thing to her since she is very openly very Christian and being a gay is a big no no in her eyes.

I refused to apologise and I haven't spoken to her since (it all happened last Friday) but I still get some evil stares from her general direction so I'm wondering if I should just suck it up and go apologise

EDIT: So I won't apologise as this is what most of you agree on but I don't think I'll keep winking at her either hahaha it sure would be funny but I don't think I'll push it since she already seems to be at her limit...

I (24f) am currently doing an MA in European History. This incident took place during an online class that is shared with all of the MA courses in the History department and involved an older student, round 60 years old that we will call Richard.

Everything is online now and where I live it is getting very cold and wet as is usual for this season. So I threw on my Red Bull Racing hoodie because I love Formula 1, I have been watching Grand Prixs since I was 10 and this hoodie is the coziest I own. I forgot to take it off before joining our class call a few minutes early to chat to some of my course mates about our thesis proposals that are due soon when Richard joined the call. Richard is in Military History and I have previously only exchange pleasanteries and hellos with him until yesterdays class.

Richard joined the call, noticed my hoodie and jokingly stated 'oh OP very nice of your boyfriend to let you borrow his hoodie'. I laughed it off and politely corrected him going, 'oh this old thing is actually mine, no hoodie robbing here'.

Richard did not like this answer. He followed it up with 'but you're a girl. You probably don't even know what that hoodie is about so it can't be yours'. Again I laughed this off and replied 'I've been following formula one for about 14 years. I actually prefer Mclaren but Red Bull is a good team too right now'.

I thought at this point he would drop it. That we could go back to just discussing random stuff while waiting for our lecturer to join. He didn't.

Richard proceeded to, in front of the 30 others in this call, tell me that I only like Formula 1 for how attractive the drivers are. That no girl could ever understand the complexity of F1 and I was obviously lying to show him up and wouldn't be able to tell the chassis from the rear wing.

This is where I might be the asshole.

At this point I was fed up and I answered him back. I pointed out that his question was ridiculous as the chassis was the base frame of an F1 car and explained how the rear wing is attached to help with the drag of the car and the straight line speed which is why they included DRS to help reduce drag and allow for over taking in straight lines or closing gaps in seconds. I also asked him not to refer to me as a girl, that we were all equal academics and to show some respect to the females in the class which he hadn't been (he tends to speak over us) and that I know more female watchers of F1 than men so his little rant was unfounded.

Richard at this point went silent and left the class.

I have been told that by speaking back to him in a public forum (our online class) that I am an AH because I embarrased an elder and it was petty to take offence and call him out for what he said to me. The AH move was that I called him out on how he was treating me and the other women in our class in front of our 30 peers.

Since talking to friends and classmates and my family, theyre split. Most of my classmates think I handled it politely and he was being an asshole. As do most of my friends. My mother however and some male friends think I was an asshole to talk back to an elder and should have just laughed it off and ignored him. That he was just expressing an opinion and I shouldn't have corrected him publicly. I don't think I was an asshole.

Edit:

Wow. Im actually really overwhelmed by this. I honestly thought this would get a few comments and then ignored. Thank you to everyone saying Im NTA and for the awards and votes. I really didnt expect this.

To the people asking why I would post this when Im clearly NTA as youve stated. Its because while objectively knowing I wasnt in the wrong I felt awful and guilty. I felt horrible that my reaction made him leave. Im dreading class next week. Im not a confrontational person by nature. I also dont stand up for myself and my family have been heavily criticising me for talking back to someone older and not handling it privately. Im not looking for validation. I genuiely felt when I posted this there was a chance I was being horrible. I am from a small catholic town where women are seen not heard and definetly arent encourage to speak against older people although this is slowly changing.

To the people saying this isnt true because the lecturer didnt react....I stated above that we started the call early. Our lecture doesnt join us till five past hour. We started the call early to discuss assignments while waiting for class to begin. This took place before my lecturer joined the call.

Also to the people sending me abusive private messages about this and f1 please stop. They arent funny.",2020-10-21 11:56:46,1927,15989,0.87,4,0,219,0,2,22,10,17,21,,9,,,,,,1,,,,2,2,1,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,

I have an older sister who I have always had an incredibly strained relationship with. She likes to think that she's an authority over me and tries to parent me constantly, even now that we're both in our 20s. She also has never respected my interests and openly insults them, calls them stupid/a waste of time/etc. Fun times.

One thing that everyone in my family knows about me is that I don't like football. Sports don't really interest me in general, but I find football particularly boring and hard to follow. I don't watch it at all, not even the Superbowl, and every time I've been forced to watch it I've been bored out of my skull. 

On my birthday last year, my sister talks up this great present that she's giving me for the whole day, which turns out to be tickets for the whole family to an NFL game. At the time I am just like ""Uh...thanks,"" because it's actually 0% surprising that she would do something like this. The next day I ask if I can give my ticket to my boyfriend, who lives with us and likes football (Me, bf, my mom and dad live together, my sister lives separately.) She chews me out for asking and when I complain that she knows I don't like football, she says it doesn't matter because it's not about the football, it's about the experience of being together as a family.

Football day arrives and I begrudgingly went. I tried to pay attention to the game for the first 5-10 minutes or so but I truly just did not give a shit, and I don't even really understand the rules so I was not able to follow along at all. I ended up reading books on my kindle the entire time.

As we're leaving, my sister is chewing me out again for my ""protest."" She's saying that this was a gift for the entire family and I was being a bitch for not participating. At this point I'm tired, so I say something along the lines of ""Well you got me a pretty shitty gift considering that it's something you know I hate. If I got you a ticket to Comic Con 'for the family' you would have laughed it my face and you know it.""

...and yeah, I haven't heard the end of it since then, because apparently ""it's the thought that counts"" and I am supposed to show gratitude for a gift no matter what it is, especially an expensive gift.

We hadn’t really talked about names before but we both agreed that each of us will retain veto power. When we did start discussing names, both of us wanted to name her after our late mothers. Her mom’s name was Karen and my mom’s name wasn’t a meme. I told her the baby can take my mom’s name as her first name and her mom’s name as a middle name, or have an entirely different name, but I can’t okay “Karen” as a first name in any case. She got offended because she just wants to honor her mother and thinks I have a problem with that. I just don’t want to set our daughter up to be bullied throughout her life. I told her I’d be fine with whatever first name she picks as long as it doesn’t lead to the baby being picked on later in life, but she’s pretty insistent on Karen.

Edit: Wow, I didn’t expect this to blow up. I thought I’d delete this since this issue is pretty much resolved now but you guys are clearly enjoying this, so I thought I’d provide an update. We had a talk about this and why she had such an emotional reaction to my veto. Ever since her mom died suddenly when she was only fourteen, she’s wanted to name her first daughter after her and she didn’t really ever consider that the meme might be a potential obstacle. By that point, I’d thought about it for a while and realized that, as many of the comments have pointed out, Karen likely won’t be a meme by the time she’s old enough to feel its impact. So I told her I’ll recant my veto but we should still reconsider it because it still has potential complications and we might just come up with a better tribute. While exchanging ideas, we realized that both our mothers very coincidentally had the exact same middle name, Elizabeth (well mine had two middle names, and Elizabeth was one of them, but still).

Dan had a rough time growing up and frankly, my parents failed him. As a teenager he struggled with severe addiction and mental illness and they did almost nothing to help him. By the time he was done with college, he had completely cut off my parents. To this day, Dan and my parents are still estranged. I on the other hand still speak to my brother regularly. My parents, especially my mom, take every chance they can get to “mourn” the loss of their son and act as though my brother wronged them by leaving. Dan has told me he wouldn’t mind reconnecting with them, but only if they reach out and apologize first. I’ve encouraged my parents to do this, but they insist that he betrayed them.

I got married early last year to my husband Jeff. We have a happy marriage and he is adored by all my friends and family, but I feel like my parents have been crossing some boundaries. For example, whenever we’ve gone to visit them, they insist that he sleep in Dan’s room, saying that their son (my husband) has come home and should sleep in his “rightful bedroom.” Before the pandemic, my dad would take Jeff out to sporting events and introduce him as his only son. Most of the pictures of my brother in my childhood home have been replaced by pictures of my parents with Jeff. 

The other day, my mom called to invite me and Jeff over for the holidays. I told her I wasn’t comfortable traveling during a covid spike. She was irritated but dropped it. THEN she called Jeff and begged him to visit without me because apparently “it’s cruel for a mother to be without her child on Christmas.” Jeff politely told her he wasn’t going to visit without me. She’s been emotionally blackmailing him ever since, sending him pictures of stockings with his, my mom’s, and my dad’s names on them and saying “but we already promised so-and-so that our son will be in town!” 

This felt ridiculous and unsettling, so I called her up yesterday and explained to her that she’s violating our boundaries, Jeff is not her replacement son, and no matter how much she pretends she doesn’t have an actual son, she does and it is her responsibility to make up for the damage she did to that relationship before it’s too late. She started crying and called me cruel for mentioning Dan and said I have no idea what it’s like to be a mother and it’s disgusting that I’m trying to deprive her of a son when she has already lost one by keeping Jeff away from her. My father agrees with my mother and Jeff agrees with me, though he doesn’t like to rock the boat and thinks I should apologize anyway. I thought I did the right thing, but now I’m really not sure if I went too far. AITA?

Edit: Thank you all for the support and advice! I appreciate it so much. I haven’t been able to sleep so I’ve been reading every comment. I don’t know if I have the emotional energy to post in justnomil yet but I’m reading a lot of what’s posted there and already feel less alone. My tentative plan is to arrange for me and Jeff to get individual therapy and maybe couples therapy later on. We’re going NC with my parents for a while. I’m also planning to invite Dan to stay with us over the holidays. I have a lot to make up for and I want to spend as much time as I can with him and let him know he’s loved.

My mother started her own chocolate making company a couple years ago. She has been moderately successful locally and enjoys what she does, overall, I’m very happy that she found something she loves to do and is passionate about. If I’m being honest though, I just don’t like her products. She makes 80-97% dark chocolate and I’m a sugary, cheap milk chocolate fan at best. She’s a little self righteous sometimes, she took a course on chocolate tasting which she compares to wine tasting (which I’m also not a fan of, I’m just not that classy lol) and says that to enjoy her chocolate there’s a whole process to sniffing each piece and letting it melt on your tongue, breathing a certain way to “taste the aromas” etc. She does not know that I don’t like her chocolates, it would break her heart. Whenever she has a new one I grin and bear it, and will always try it. She gives me tons of it and I thank her, and give it away to friends who will enjoy it and I encourage them to share with their friends and tell them where to buy it. I’ve told her things like “oh I still have plenty from last time you gave me some” to try to discourage her from giving me more because she thinks I eat it all, but she insists. 

Anyways

When I was pregnant last year I had an intense craving for these Belgian milk chocolate sea shells (if you know, you know. They have a hazelnut filling and are delish) and I couldn’t find them anywhere. I was talking to a coworker about my craving and god love her she went out of her way to 2 stores and found me a box. 

Here’s were I may be the AH. I went onto social media, tagged my coworker and said “I have the best coworkers!” And a photo of the box of chocolates.

My mother calls me within seconds of posting and says that if I had a chocolate craving I should have asked her! I said I know, but I wanted those particular Sea shells. She then spirals and tells me that I’m “directly supporting her competitors and it’s embarrassing” (this is a global brand, whereas she only sells in our community, but I guess I see her point?) I apologize that she sees it that way, and point out that I regularly share posts about her company, this was more about the gesture my colleague made. She huffs and hangs up. She then blocks me on all social media and gives me the silent treatment for 3 weeks. Eventually I have my baby so she comes back around. 

Flash forward to now, she asks how I’m doing, I say great, hows the business, and she says “it’s great, but I guess you don’t care since you’re all about the cheap stuff” and brings up the post. 

Is she being unreasonable? It’s been *a year*. I completely forgot about the stupid post, I left it up all this time and she’s still sour about it so I took it down. But AITA for mentioning other chocolate companies?

EDIT

A lot of people have said I should tell her that I prefer milk chocolate, believe me I’ve told her at least a dozen times but she keeps giving me hers to try and insists I’m just not “tasting” correctly and that I need to “refine” my palate because “milk chocolate isn’t real chocolate”

Also I apologize, but for privacy reasons I will not be sharing my mother’s company name. Thank you for understanding!",2020-11-10 14:32:22,752,6639,0.97,1,1,246,0,,,1,1,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I guess she doesn't like to see her mom sad even tho you can tell she is faking it. Like when we were gonna go on a relaxing date she cancled it because her mom wanted to go to the mall with our first born and when my wife said she had plans her mom sobbed crocodile tears and she went and said we can do the date later. Well we didnt go on that date till 2 months later because i didnt have days to take off when she was off. This is one example. 

So a few days ago my wife was gonna go into labor with our second and she had promised i can be in the room until my mil told her a whole sob story about how she can wait outside and is too impatient and my wife caved in and when i took her to the hospital i was ordered to stay outside with our son. Now at this point i felt very upset and angry so i called my sister and asked if me and my son could stay over for a day and she said yes so i left with my son went to the house got some clothes and left. I texted my wife that im staying over with my sister with my son and that we can talk after she feels better. 

After that i talked to my sister about it while my son was hanging out with his cousin and then my wife texted me saying what was going on. So i told her about how i feel upset that she keeps choosing her mom over me and that when she feels better we can talk about it further.

Shs understood and so for the past 2 days when im not at the house my mil is there to help and when im there i just do all the normal stuff and some house work. 

I was starting to wonder if im an ass because my wife looks upset and i just feel bad. Sorry if this was more of a rant or dosent maks sense im just not in the right state of mind

Edit: alot people people asked for an edit so here it is. 1. No i was not in a waiting room i was outside in the car with my 4yr son. 2. We had discussed that i would be in the room for a while even right before we went to the hospital. I had only found out i wasnt aloud in after the doctors asked who my wife wanted and mil pleaded to be in and my wife chose her.

Edit 2: to clear some more things up. We went with our son to the hospital because it was kinda unexpected that my wife was going into labor so we called mil to meet us at the hospital and pick up our son. and as she lives closer she got there before us.

She's opinionated, needy, and can be a bit phony. If she doesn't get her way she immediately goes into a bad mood. 

A few years back my wife was suffering from depression. My brother's fiance made a comment about one of my wife's family members. The comment was rude, but it wasn't personal or meant to offend. Fueled by uncontrolled emotions, my wife decided to tell her off, calling her out on her childishness and phony behavior. Both my wife and my brother's fiance traded some harsh words, a few b-words were thrown around. I realize my wife was wrong to blow up and start the arguement, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't happy that someone finally put my brother's fiance in her place.

Luckily my relationship with my brother was not impacted. My wife got over the arguement rather quickly, she didn't like my brother's fiance, but wanted to be cordial for my sake. However, my brother's fiance refuses to move on.

My wife and my brother's fiance would see each other at family gatherings, and at first would completely ignore each other. A few months passed and they would briefly converse with eachother if required. A few more months passed and they could be in the same conversation within a group, but my brother's fiance would purposely go out of her way not to include my wife. My wife would go out of her way to try to talk to my brother's fiance but she would completely ignore her. My brother's fiance would show everyone in the room a photo but skip over my wife. My brother's fiance would say bye to everyone when leaving, but not my wife. My brother's fiance would invite me to their house for parties, but tell me my wife was not invited. I haven't attended a party or event at my brother's since.

Half a year passed and my wife reached out to my brother's fiance, asking if they could move past things so a rift wouldn't be created in the family. My brother's fiance responded as expected, and said she wanted no part of making amends or my wife in her life. 

 Somehow my brother and I have still been able to hangout and converse as if there isn't a 10,000lb elephant in the room.

My brother had asked me to be a co-bestman along with our other brother, which in the moment I obviously said yes. I recently received the wedding invitation, and as you guessed my wife was not invited. I was a bit shocked and saddened. My brother and his fiance are set to be married in June (Covid pending) and my wife told me I should go. I have no interest in attending knowing she is not welcomed.

I got married, had two kids and was a SAHM (stay at home mom) for the past few years up until my divorce. She loves my kids (8M and 5F) and loves to brag about being an Auntie. 
My sister and I had a tough time growing up together  because of our own issues and were never really close. However, when she found out I was able to have a viable pregnancy, she got....weird. shes never had kids of her own and now refers to me as ""The breeder"", as I am the only one of my siblings to have kids. At first I brushed it off because it's weird but not really malicious. Or so I thought. When my youngest was born early she refused to show up because the middle name was a name she had wanted and I ""should have waited til she had a child to have another"" she now uses the name ""breeder"" to refer to me. I've told her I dont like it and to use my name. She has refused. At one point she called our mother and asked ""hows the breeder"" to which our mom told her to either call me by my name or hang up. She chose to end the call. 
I get she may be upset that I have kids and my heart goes out to her, but at the same time I feel like she cant say shes happy to be an aunt and loves my kids if she is constantly being mad at how she even has a niece and nephew in the first place. I have told her the name bothers me and she continued so I  all but cut her off. Her messeges get left on read and I bitch-block when she calls. I leave her out of social media posts involving my kids and dont take my kids to places if she is there. This has caused friction as my mother backs me up and is accused of only taking my side because I'm the breeder and gave her grandkids. ( my moms opinion on it comes down to ""they are your kids. Do what you want) 
I've gotten messages from her friends about how I'm a horrible sister and she misses the kids and I'm doing this because I'm the breeder and have nothing else to ""hold over her""  I refuse to back down until she stops calling me that but as her friends are using the term, I dont see it happening. So reddit, AITA?

EDIT: I understand why everyone is suggesting calling her barren but I'm not want to A) stop to her level, B) hurt her the way she has hurt me and more importantly C) teach my kids that its acceptable to be rude and mock someone for things out of their control.",2020-11-11 22:08:06,651,7146,0.97,2,1,243,0,,1,2,1,1,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many years ago, I wasn't doing very well mentally and was hospitalized. My sister and I had a rocky relationship but were just starting to get close again. When this hospitalization occurred, I was ashamed and did not want her to know, fearing it would destroy what took so long to repair. After I was released, my dad told me that my sister knew about it but she did not contact me, just checked in with my dad about me. I was 100% certain that the only person who knew was my dad and he assured me he did not tell her. It then dawned on me that my brother in law's sister works as a nurse where I was hospitalized so I called the hospital. I felt embarrassed about the accusation but they were very nice and took my concerns seriously.

A couple weeks later, they followed up and verified that she did indeed access my medical records without being my nurse. They said she was scheduled to meet with a board or a committee but they could not inform me of the outcome.

Since then, my sister and BIL have cut off all communication. I have written letters, tried calling her, etc. but I was blocked entirely. I did not intend to hurt anyone... I was more upset that this very sensitive and private subject was violated by an employee and I did not feel it was right of her to use her position to access my records and inform my sister. If I had wanted my sister to know, I would have told her on my own time.

However, I have missed meeting the birth of both my niece and nephew and lost my sister and friends associated with her. Family is very important to me as mine has been very broken and its heart breaking to not be included.

Was I in the wrong?

EDIT:I'm now realizing a large group of strangers are better family than my own. I was not expecting this to be so one sided because of the severe backlash I received from my own. I have been feeling guilt and remorse for too many years and I feel like I can finally move on and stop beating myself up for this. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. And please continue to share your thoughts and your stories. These discussions have the potential for healing, education and improved mental health.  


Edit 2: I am still here and going through the post one by one and intend to respond as much as possible. I'm once again taken by the kindness I've been shown. Additionally, I've slept like a baby the past couple days with a new found energy and confidence. I don't know how to express my gratitude but if I can repay it in any way, I'm all ears.

When I was 16, I developed an eating disorder. I lost weight and my period. It continued until my senior year of high school, when I decided I had to recover before I went to college.

I put a lot of work in, and I've gotten my weight up and my period back.

Mentally I'm still not 100% there. There were things that were holding back my recovery so I decided to fix them. I have a hard time stopping myself from looking at the calorie content of foods and then I don't want to eat them anymore. So (and I know this sounds neurotic), I get rid of all the nutritional information of food once I bring it into my apartment. I either sharpie it out, or I rip it off.

None of that is a problem normally. The problem comes in last week. My brother and his girlfriend are visiting and asked to stay with me. I don't know her very well but I was excited to see them so I said sure.  

Turns out she's on a diet. My brother had talked to her before about my ED, and I could tell she was careful at first not to mention anything triggering, which I appreciated. But then later that day we were in the kitchen together and she saw my sharpied out nutrition labels for the first time. She was clearly shocked and asked some questions about my ED.

Then she kept acting weird. Yesterday, she pulled me aside and told me it was hard for her to stick to her diet with no nutritional information, and that she was afraid she was going to gain weight. She asked me if I wouldn't mind stopping just for the three more days she was here. I told her I couldn't, but she asked later that day if she could keep some food in her room or a special part of the kitchen. I once again told her no. I thought it was over, but I guess she talked to my brother because he asked me too. I was ruder to him because I was tired of them asking. I snapped at him and I thought they would finally stop.

Well today I woke up to several things. One was a long email from my brother about how I had to take a step forward and trust myself. My boyfriend also told me how before I woke up, my brother had asked him to convince me. I thought I could just ignore it all, but when I went to go make myself breakfast I saw that my brother/his gf had put some low calorie foods in the pantry, which are exactly what I find triggering. I took it all and dumped it in their room.

When they got home, they asked me why. I yelled at them about how it was a huge violation of my trust. My brother said they were just trying to help me, and that eventually I was going to have to get used to nutritional information again. His gf also said that she was just trying to be healthy and how I needed to relax. Well, I told her that it wasn't healthy for her to be so obsessed with calories, and that maybe she was actually the one with the ED.

They stormed out. My boyfriend doesn't think I did anything wrong, but I'm wondering now. AITA?",2020-11-12 18:33:22,704,5131,0.97,8,2,289,19,,1,1,,2,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My little sister and her husband are both in the service industry. They are struggling to save up for a down payment for a house. She’s asked me to help her and her husband with a down payment for a house since I was financially helping my brother out. I told her no, that these two things are not similar at all. It’s also not something I’m interested in and I’m not even that close to my sister. Her husband threw some major shade at me over the situation at a family barbecue a couples weeks ago.

He already has a son from a former relationship with his Ex (25/f). Tbh, she hates us and wants us out of the picture. She's the kind of person to think everyone in the world is against her and therefore she made my fiancé up to be the bad guy (he really isn't, he's loving and caring and just wants to be in his son's life). Their relationship has been toxic from the start and since they split up (about 2 years ago) she's trying to separate them. In December we are also going to court to fight for custody because right now my fiancé doesn't have any (he was at university back then and lived a few hours away and she tricked him into giving her sole custody for the time being but never gave him his rights back). So much for the backstory.

&#x200B;

Since they are separated every gift my stepson received has been sold. She just tries to make money from it and he never gets to keep the stuff. While talking to my sister about this year's Christmas presents for our children I dropped this information and she told me to just put his name on everything (like getting it printed on a blanket f.e.). I thought about it and told my fiancè about it. He's okay with it but told me it could be seen as an a\*\*hole move. I just want to do what's best for my stepson and want him to enjoy everything he gets. I also want to gift something small to her (like chocolate) just to be nice but WIBTA if I did this?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'm in a good and healthy relationship. I know everything there is to know about the situation but I can't share all the details because I want to respect the privacy of the people involved. It's also not part of the question. I love my fiancé and we are in a good place. He didn't cheat with me, we met when they were already separated and he did have time to recover from the breakup. We know it seems a bit hasty to get married so soon but we want to because we love each other. There is no money involved except child support he's paying since day 1. I just want to know if I would be the a\*\*hole. I can't answer to all of you, but I'll try my best.

Sadly my grandpa passed away about 3 months ago. His death hid me really hard because I used to spend so much time with him.

Last week I received a letter from the probate court informing me that I will inherit his old house and most of his assets. My parents inherited his apartment where he lived in his last years to be closer to us and my older siblings inherited only a small part of his fortune as far as I know.

My brother and sister weren't too happy when they heard that I had inherited my grandpa's old house. His house is worth a huge amount of money, we're talking nearly 2 million € and my siblings want a share of it. Yesterday evening when they visited they took me aside to urge me to share my inheritance with them. They think it is unfair I got so much more than they did and think it would be only fair to divide the inheritance by 3. I was reluctant, but they got pushy until my parents heard of this and sent me to my room to talk to my siblings. I don't know exactly what then happened but I heard loud voices and apparently my siblings left the house furious.

Now I don't exactly know why but I don't really want to share my inheritance. I feel like my grandpa wanted me to have it but I'm also not sure if I'm just being greedy.
